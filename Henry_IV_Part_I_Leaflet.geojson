    "content":"SCENE I. London. The palace.\nEnter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others\nKING HENRY IV\nSo shaken as we are, so wan with care,\nFind we a time for frighted peace to pant,\nAnd breathe short-winded accents of new broils\nTo be commenced in strands afar remote.\nNo more the thirsty entrance of this soil\nShall daub her lips with her own children's blood;\nNor more shall trenching war channel her fields,\nNor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs\nOf hostile paces: those opposed eyes,\nWhich, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,\nAll of one nature, of one substance bred,\nDid lately meet in the intestine shock\nAnd furious close of civil butchery\nShall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,\nMarch all one way and be no more opposed\nAgainst acquaintance, kindred and allies:\nThe edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,\nNo more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,\nAs far as to the sepulchre of Christ,\nWhose soldier now, under whose blessed cross\nWe are impressed and engaged to fight,\nForthwith a power of English shall we levy;\nWhose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb\nTo chase these pagans in those holy fields\nOver whose acres walk'd those blessed feet\nWhich fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd\nFor our advantage on the bitter cross.\nBut this our purpose now is twelve month old,\nAnd bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:\nTherefore we meet not now. Then let me hear\nOf you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,\nWhat yesternight our council did decree\nIn forwarding this dear expedience.\nWESTMORELAND\nMy liege, this haste was hot in question,\nAnd many limits of the charge set down\nBut yesternight: when all athwart there came\nA post from Wales loaden with heavy news;\nWhose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,\nLeading the men of Herefordshire to fight\nAgainst the irregular and wild Glendower,\nWas by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,\nA thousand of his people butchered;\nUpon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,\nSuch beastly shameless transformation,\nBy those Welshwomen done as may not be\nWithout much shame retold or spoken of.\nKING HENRY IV\nIt seems then that the tidings of this broil\nBrake off our business for the Holy Land.\nWESTMORELAND\nThis match'd with other did, my gracious lord;\nFor more uneven and unwelcome news\nCame from the north and thus it did import:\nOn Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,\nYoung Harry Percy and brave Archibald,\nThat ever-valiant and approved Scot,\nAt Holmedon met,\nWhere they did spend a sad and bloody hour,\nAs by discharge of their artillery,\nAnd shape of likelihood, the news was told;\nFor he that brought them, in the very heat\nAnd pride of their contention did take horse,\nUncertain of the issue any way.\nKING HENRY IV\nHere is a dear, a true industrious friend,\nSir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.\nStain'd with the variation of each soil\nBetwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;\nAnd he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.\nThe Earl of Douglas is discomfited:\nTen thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,\nBalk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see\nOn Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took\nMordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son\nTo beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,\nOf Murray, Angus, and Menteith:\nAnd is not this an honourable spoil?\nA gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?\nWESTMORELAND\nIn faith,\nIt is a conquest for a prince to boast of.\nKING HENRY IV\nYea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin\nIn envy that my Lord Northumberland\nShould be the father to so blest a son,\nA son who is the theme of honour's tongue;\nAmongst a grove, the very straightest plant;\nWho is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:\nWhilst I, by looking on the praise of him,\nSee riot and dishonour stain the brow\nOf my young Harry. O that it could be proved\nThat some night-tripping fairy had exchanged\nIn cradle-clothes our children where they lay,\nAnd call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!\nThen would I have his Harry, and he mine.\nBut let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,\nOf this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,\nWhich he in this adventure hath surprised,\nTo his own use he keeps; and sends me word,\nI shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.\nWESTMORELAND\nThis is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,\nMalevolent to you in all aspects;\nWhich makes him prune himself, and bristle up\nThe crest of youth against your dignity.\nKING HENRY IV\nBut I have sent for him to answer this;\nAnd for this cause awhile we must neglect\nOur holy purpose to Jerusalem.\nCousin, on Wednesday next our council we\nWill hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:\nBut come yourself with speed to us again;\nFor more is to be said and to be done\nThan out of anger can be uttered.\nWESTMORELAND\nI will, my liege.\nExeunt",

    "content":"SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.\nEnter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF\nFALSTAFF\nNow, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?\nPRINCE HENRY\nThou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack\nand unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon\nbenches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to\ndemand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.\nWhat a devil hast thou to do with the time of the\nday? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes\ncapons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the\nsigns of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself\na fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no\nreason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand\nthe time of the day.\nFALSTAFF\nIndeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take\npurses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not\nby Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,\nI prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God\nsave thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace\nthou wilt have none,--\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat, none?\nFALSTAFF\nNo, by my troth, not so much as will serve to\nprologue to an egg and butter.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell, how then? come, roundly, roundly.\nFALSTAFF\nMarry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not\nus that are squires of the night's body be called\nthieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's\nforesters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the\nmoon; and let men say we be men of good government,\nbeing governed, as the sea is, by our noble and\nchaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the\nfortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and\nflow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,\nby the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold\nmost resolutely snatched on Monday night and most\ndissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with\nswearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'\nnow in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder\nand by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.\nFALSTAFF\nBy the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my\nhostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?\nPRINCE HENRY\nAs the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And\nis not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?\nFALSTAFF\nHow now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and\nthy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a\nbuff jerkin?\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhy, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?\nFALSTAFF\nWell, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a\ntime and oft.\nPRINCE HENRY\nDid I ever call for thee to pay thy part?\nFALSTAFF\nNo; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.\nPRINCE HENRY\nYea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;\nand where it would not, I have used my credit.\nFALSTAFF\nYea, and so used it that were it not here apparent\nthat thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet\nwag, shall there be gallows standing in England when\nthou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is\nwith the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do\nnot thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.\nPRINCE HENRY\nNo; thou shalt.\nFALSTAFF\nShall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have\nthe hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.\nFALSTAFF\nWell, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my\nhumour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell\nyou.\nPRINCE HENRY\nFor obtaining of suits?\nFALSTAFF\nYea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman\nhath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy\nas a gib cat or a lugged bear.\nPRINCE HENRY\nOr an old lion, or a lover's lute.\nFALSTAFF\nYea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of\nMoor-ditch?\nFALSTAFF\nThou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed\nthe most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young\nprince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more\nwith vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a\ncommodity of good names were to be bought. An old\nlord of the council rated me the other day in the\nstreet about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet\nhe talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and\nyet he talked wisely, and in the street too.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the\nstreets, and no man regards it.\nFALSTAFF\nO, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able\nto corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon\nme, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew\nthee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man\nshould speak truly, little better than one of the\nwicked. I must give over this life, and I will give\nit over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:\nI'll be damned for never a king's son in\nChristendom.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhere shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?\nFALSTAFF\n'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I\ndo not, call me villain and baffle me.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying\nto purse-taking.\nFALSTAFF\nWhy, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a\nman to labour in his vocation.\nEnter POINS\n\nPoins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a\nmatch. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what\nhole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the\nmost omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to\na true man.\nPRINCE HENRY\nGood morrow, Ned.\nPOINS\nGood morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?\nwhat says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how\nagrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou\nsoldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira\nand a cold capon's leg?\nPRINCE HENRY\nSir John stands to his word, the devil shall have\nhis bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of\nproverbs: he will give the devil his due.\nPOINS\nThen art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.\nPRINCE HENRY\nElse he had been damned for cozening the devil.\nPOINS\nBut, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four\no'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going\nto Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders\nriding to London with fat purses: I have vizards\nfor you all; you have horses for yourselves:\nGadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke\nsupper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it\nas secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff\nyour purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry\nat home and be hanged.\nFALSTAFF\nHear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,\nI'll hang you for going.\nPOINS\nYou will, chops?\nFALSTAFF\nHal, wilt thou make one?\nPRINCE HENRY\nWho, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.\nFALSTAFF\nThere's neither honesty, manhood, nor good\nfellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood\nroyal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.\nFALSTAFF\nWhy, that's well said.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell, come what will, I'll tarry at home.\nFALSTAFF\nBy the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI care not.\nPOINS\nSir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:\nI will lay him down such reasons for this adventure\nthat he shall go.\nFALSTAFF\nWell, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him\nthe ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may\nmove and what he hears may be believed, that the\ntrue prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false\nthief; for the poor abuses of the time want\ncountenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.\nPRINCE HENRY\nFarewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!\nExit Falstaff\n\nPOINS\nNow, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us\nto-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot\nmanage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill\nshall rob those men that we have already waylaid:\nyourself and I will not be there; and when they\nhave the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut\nthis head off from my shoulders.\nPRINCE HENRY\nHow shall we part with them in setting forth?\nPOINS\nWhy, we will set forth before or after them, and\nappoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at\nour pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure\nupon the exploit themselves; which they shall have\nno sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.\nPRINCE HENRY\nYea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our\nhorses, by our habits and by every other\nappointment, to be ourselves.\nPOINS\nTut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them\nin the wood; our vizards we will change after we\nleave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram\nfor the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.\nPRINCE HENRY\nYea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.\nPOINS\nWell, for two of them, I know them to be as\ntrue-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the\nthird, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll\nforswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the\nincomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will\ntell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at\nleast, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what\nextremities he endured; and in the reproof of this\nlies the jest.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell, I'll go with thee: provide us all things\nnecessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;\nthere I'll sup. Farewell.\nPOINS\nFarewell, my lord.\nExit Poins\n\nPRINCE HENRY\nI know you all, and will awhile uphold\nThe unyoked humour of your idleness:\nYet herein will I imitate the sun,\nWho doth permit the base contagious clouds\nTo smother up his beauty from the world,\nThat, when he please again to be himself,\nBeing wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,\nBy breaking through the foul and ugly mists\nOf vapours that did seem to strangle him.\nIf all the year were playing holidays,\nTo sport would be as tedious as to work;\nBut when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,\nAnd nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.\nSo, when this loose behavior I throw off\nAnd pay the debt I never promised,\nBy how much better than my word I am,\nBy so much shall I falsify men's hopes;\nAnd like bright metal on a sullen ground,\nMy reformation, glittering o'er my fault,\nShall show more goodly and attract more eyes\nThan that which hath no foil to set it off.\nI'll so offend, to make offence a skill;\nRedeeming time when men think least I will.\nExit",

The palace.\nEnter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others\nKING HENRY IV\nMy blood hath been too cold and temperate,\nUnapt to stir at these indignities,\nAnd you have found me; for accordingly\nYou tread upon my patience: but be sure\nI will from henceforth rather be myself,\nMighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;\nWhich hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,\nAnd therefore lost that title of respect\nWhich the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.\nEARL OF WORCESTER\nOur house, my sovereign liege, little deserves\nThe scourge of greatness to be used on it;\nAnd that same greatness too which our own hands\nHave holp to make so portly.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nMy lord.--\nKING HENRY IV\nWorcester, get thee gone; for I do see\nDanger and disobedience in thine eye:\nO, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,\nAnd majesty might never yet endure\nThe moody frontier of a servant brow.\nYou have good leave to leave us: when we need\nYour use and counsel, we shall send for you.\nExit Worcester\n\nYou were about to speak.\nTo North\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nYea, my good lord.\nThose prisoners in your highness' name demanded,\nWhich Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,\nWere, as he says, not with such strength denied\nAs is deliver'd to your majesty:\nEither envy, therefore, or misprison\nIs guilty of this fault and not my son.\nHOTSPUR\nMy liege, I did deny no prisoners.\nBut I remember, when the fight was done,\nWhen I was dry with rage and extreme toil,\nBreathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,\nCame there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,\nFresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd\nShow'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;\nHe was perfumed like a milliner;\nAnd 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held\nA pouncet-box, which ever and anon\nHe gave his nose and took't away again;\nWho therewith angry, when it next came there,\nTook it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,\nAnd as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,\nHe call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,\nTo bring a slovenly unhandsome corse\nBetwixt the wind and his nobility.\nWith many holiday and lady terms\nHe question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded\nMy prisoners in your majesty's behalf.\nI then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,\nTo be so pester'd with a popinjay,\nOut of my grief and my impatience,\nAnswer'd neglectingly I know not what,\nHe should or he should not; for he made me mad\nTo see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet\nAnd talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman\nOf guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--\nAnd telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth\nWas parmaceti for an inward bruise;\nAnd that it was great pity, so it was,\nThis villanous salt-petre should be digg'd\nOut of the bowels of the harmless earth,\nWhich many a good tall fellow had destroy'd\nSo cowardly; and but for these vile guns,\nHe would himself have been a soldier.\nThis bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,\nI answer'd indirectly, as I said;\nAnd I beseech you, let not his report\nCome current for an accusation\nBetwixt my love and your high majesty.\nSIR WALTER BLUNT\nThe circumstance consider'd, good my lord,\nWhate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said\nTo such a person and in such a place,\nAt such a time, with all the rest retold,\nMay reasonably die and never rise\nTo do him wrong or any way impeach\nWhat then he said, so he unsay it now.\nKING HENRY IV\nWhy, yet he doth deny his prisoners,\nBut with proviso and exception,\nThat we at our own charge shall ransom straight\nHis brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;\nWho, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd\nThe lives of those that he did lead to fight\nAgainst that great magician, damn'd Glendower,\nWhose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March\nHath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,\nBe emptied to redeem a traitor home?\nShall we but treason? and indent with fears,\nWhen they have lost and forfeited themselves?\nNo, on the barren mountains let him starve;\nFor I shall never hold that man my friend\nWhose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost\nTo ransom home revolted Mortimer.\nHOTSPUR\nRevolted Mortimer!\nHe never did fall off, my sovereign liege,\nBut by the chance of war; to prove that true\nNeeds no more but one tongue for all those wounds,\nThose mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took\nWhen on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,\nIn single opposition, hand to hand,\nHe did confound the best part of an hour\nIn changing hardiment with great Glendower:\nThree times they breathed and three times did\nthey drink,\nUpon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;\nWho then, affrighted with their bloody looks,\nRan fearfully among the trembling reeds,\nAnd hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,\nBloodstained with these valiant combatants.\nNever did base and rotten policy\nColour her working with such deadly wounds;\nNor could the noble Mortimer\nReceive so many, and all willingly:\nThen let not him be slander'd with revolt.\nKING HENRY IV\nThou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;\nHe never did encounter with Glendower:\nI tell thee,\nHe durst as well have met the devil alone\nAs Owen Glendower for an enemy.\nArt thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth\nLet me not hear you speak of Mortimer:\nSend me your prisoners with the speediest means,\nOr you shall hear in such a kind from me\nAs will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,\nWe licence your departure with your son.\nSend us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.\nExeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train\n\nHOTSPUR\nAn if the devil come and roar for them,\nI will not send them: I will after straight\nAnd tell him so; for I will ease my heart,\nAlbeit I make a hazard of my head.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nWhat, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:\nHere comes your uncle.\nRe-enter WORCESTER\n\nHOTSPUR\nSpeak of Mortimer!\n'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul\nWant mercy, if I do not join with him:\nYea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,\nAnd shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,\nBut I will lift the down-trod Mortimer\nAs high in the air as this unthankful king,\nAs this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nBrother, the king hath made your nephew mad.\nEARL OF WORCESTER\nWho struck this heat up after I was gone?\nHOTSPUR\nHe will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;\nAnd when I urged the ransom once again\nOf my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,\nAnd on my face he turn'd an eye of death,\nTrembling even at the name of Mortimer.\nEARL OF WORCESTER\nI cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd\nBy Richard that dead is the next of blood?\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nHe was; I heard the proclamation:\nAnd then it was when the unhappy king,\n--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth\nUpon his Irish expedition;\nFrom whence he intercepted did return\nTo be deposed and shortly murdered.\nEARL OF WORCESTER\nAnd for whose death we in the world's wide mouth\nLive scandalized and foully spoken of.\nHOTSPUR\nBut soft, I pray you; did King Richard then\nProclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer\nHeir to the crown?\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nHe did; myself did hear it.\nHOTSPUR\nNay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,\nThat wished him on the barren mountains starve.\nBut shall it be that you, that set the crown\nUpon the head of this forgetful man\nAnd for his sake wear the detested blot\nOf murderous subornation, shall it be,\nThat you a world of curses undergo,\nBeing the agents, or base second means,\nThe cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?\nO, pardon me that I descend so low,\nTo show the line and the predicament\nWherein you range under this subtle king;\nShall it for shame be spoken in these days,\nOr fill up chronicles in time to come,\nThat men of your nobility and power\nDid gage them both in an unjust behalf,\nAs both of you--God pardon it!--have done,\nTo put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,\nAn plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?\nAnd shall it in more shame be further spoken,\nThat you are fool'd, discarded and shook off\nBy him for whom these shames ye underwent?\nNo; yet time serves wherein you may redeem\nYour banish'd honours and restore yourselves\nInto the good thoughts of the world again,\nRevenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt\nOf this proud king, who studies day and night\nTo answer all the debt he owes to you\nEven with the bloody payment of your deaths:\nTherefore, I say--\nEARL OF WORCESTER\nPeace, cousin, say no more:\nAnd now I will unclasp a secret book,\nAnd to your quick-conceiving discontents\nI'll read you matter deep and dangerous,\nAs full of peril and adventurous spirit\nAs to o'er-walk a current roaring loud\nOn the unsteadfast footing of a spear.\nHOTSPUR\nIf he fall in, good night!

But hark ye; what\ncunning match have you made with this jest of the\ndrawer? come, what's the issue?\nPRINCE HENRY\nI am now of all humours that have showed themselves\nhumours since the old days of goodman Adam to the\npupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.\nRe-enter FRANCIS\n\nWhat's o'clock, Francis?\nFRANCIS\nAnon, anon, sir.\nExit\n\nPRINCE HENRY\nThat ever this fellow should have fewer words than a\nparrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is\nupstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of\na reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the\nHotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or\nseven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his\nhands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet\nlife! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,\n'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan\nhorse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some\nfourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I\nprithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and\nthat damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his\nwife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.\nEnter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine\n\nPOINS\nWelcome, Jack: where hast thou been?\nFALSTAFF\nA plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!\nmarry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I\nlead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend\nthem and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!\nGive me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?\nHe drinks\n\nPRINCE HENRY\nDidst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?\npitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale\nof the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.\nFALSTAFF\nYou rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is\nnothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:\nyet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime\nin it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;\ndie when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be\nnot forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a\nshotten herring. There live not three good men\nunhanged in England; and one of them is fat and\ngrows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.\nI would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any\nthing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.\nPRINCE HENRY\nHow now, wool-sack! what mutter you?\nFALSTAFF\nA king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy\nkingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy\nsubjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,\nI'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhy, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?\nFALSTAFF\nAre not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?\nPOINS\n'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the\nLord, I'll stab thee.\nFALSTAFF\nI call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call\nthee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I\ncould run as fast as thou canst. You are straight\nenough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your\nback: call you that backing of your friends? A\nplague upon such backing! give me them that will\nface me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I\ndrunk to-day.\nPRINCE HENRY\nO villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou\ndrunkest last.\nFALSTAFF\nAll's one for that.\nHe drinks\n\nA plague of all cowards, still say I.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat's the matter?\nFALSTAFF\nWhat's the matter! there be four of us here have\nta'en a thousand pound this day morning.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhere is it, Jack? where is it?\nFALSTAFF\nWhere is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon\npoor four of us.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat, a hundred, man?\nFALSTAFF\nI am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a\ndozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by\nmiracle. I am eight times thrust through the\ndoublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut\nthrough and through; my sword hacked like a\nhand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since\nI was a man: all would not do. A plague of all\ncowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or\nless than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.\nPRINCE HENRY\nSpeak, sirs; how was it?\nGADSHILL\nWe four set upon some dozen--\nFALSTAFF\nSixteen at least, my lord.\nGADSHILL\nAnd bound them.\nPETO\nNo, no, they were not bound.\nFALSTAFF\nYou rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I\nam a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.\nGADSHILL\nAs we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--\nFALSTAFF\nAnd unbound the rest, and then come in the other.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat, fought you with them all?\nFALSTAFF\nAll! I know not what you call all; but if I fought\nnot with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if\nthere were not two or three and fifty upon poor old\nJack, then am I no two-legged creature.\nPRINCE HENRY\nPray God you have not murdered some of them.\nFALSTAFF\nNay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two\nof them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues\nin buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell\nthee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou\nknowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my\npoint. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat, four? thou saidst but two even now.\nFALSTAFF\nFour, Hal; I told thee four.\nPOINS\nAy, ay, he said four.\nFALSTAFF\nThese four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at\nme. I made me no more ado but took all their seven\npoints in my target, thus.\nPRINCE HENRY\nSeven? why, there were but four even now.\nFALSTAFF\nIn buckram?\nPOINS\nAy, four, in buckram suits.\nFALSTAFF\nSeven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.\nPRINCE HENRY\nPrithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.\nFALSTAFF\nDost thou hear me, Hal?\nPRINCE HENRY\nAy, and mark thee too, Jack.\nFALSTAFF\nDo so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine\nin buckram that I told thee of--\nPRINCE HENRY\nSo, two more already.\nFALSTAFF\nTheir points being broken,--\nPOINS\nDown fell their hose.\nFALSTAFF\nBegan to give me ground: but I followed me close,\ncame in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of\nthe eleven I paid.\nPRINCE HENRY\nO monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!\nFALSTAFF\nBut, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten\nknaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive\nat me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst\nnot see thy hand.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThese lies are like their father that begets them;\ngross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou\nclay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou\nwhoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--\nFALSTAFF\nWhat, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth\nthe truth?\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhy, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal\ngreen, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy\nhand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?\nPOINS\nCome, your reason, Jack, your reason.\nFALSTAFF\nWhat, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the\nstrappado, or all the racks in the world, I would\nnot tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on\ncompulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as\nblackberries, I would give no man a reason upon\ncompulsion, I.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine\ncoward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,\nthis huge hill of flesh,--\nFALSTAFF\n'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried\nneat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O\nfor breath to utter what is like thee! you\ntailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile\nstanding-tuck,--\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and\nwhen thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,\nhear me speak but this.\nPOINS\nMark, Jack.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWe two saw you four set on four and bound them, and\nwere masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain\ntale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you\nfour; and, with a word, out-faced you from your\nprize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in\nthe house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts\naway as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared\nfor mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard\nbull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword\nas thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!\nWhat trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst\nthou now find out to hide thee from this open and\napparent shame?\nPOINS\nCome, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?\nFALSTAFF\nBy the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.\nWhy, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the\nheir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?\nwhy, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but\nbeware instinct; the lion will not touch the true\nprince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a\ncoward on instinct. I shall think the better of\nmyself and thee during my life; I for a valiant\nlion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,\nlads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap\nto the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.\nGallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles\nof good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be\nmerry? shall we have a play extempore?\nPRINCE HENRY\nContent; and the argument shall be thy running away.\nFALSTAFF\nAh, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!\nEnter Hostess\n\nHostess\nO Jesu, my lord the prince!\nPRINCE HENRY\nHow now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to\nme?\nHostess\nMarry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at\ndoor would speak with you: he says he comes from\nyour father.\nPRINCE HENRY\nGive him as much as will make him a royal man, and\nsend him back again to my mother.\nFALSTAFF\nWhat manner of man is he?\nHostess\nAn old man.\nFALSTAFF\nWhat doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall\nI give him his answer?\nPRINCE HENRY\nPrithee, do, Jack.\nFALSTAFF\n'Faith, and I'll send him packing.\nExit FALSTAFF\n\nPRINCE HENRY\nNow, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,\nPeto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you\nran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true\nprince; no, fie!\nBARDOLPH\n'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.\nPRINCE HENRY\n'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's\nsword so hacked?\nPETO\nWhy, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would\nswear truth out of England but he would make you\nbelieve it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.\nBARDOLPH\nYea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to\nmake them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments\nwith it and swear it was the blood of true men. I\ndid that I did not this seven year before, I blushed\nto hear his monstrous devices.\nPRINCE HENRY\nO villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years\nago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since\nthou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and\nsword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what\ninstinct hadst thou for it?\nBARDOLPH\nMy lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold\nthese exhalations?\nPRINCE HENRY\nI do.\nBARDOLPH\nWhat think you they portend?\nPRINCE HENRY\nHot livers and cold purses.\nBARDOLPH\nCholer, my lord, if rightly taken.\nPRINCE HENRY\nNo, if rightly taken, halter.\nRe-enter FALSTAFF\n\nHere comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.\nHow now, my sweet creature of bombast!\nHow long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?\nFALSTAFF\nMy own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was\nnot an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have\ncrept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of\nsighing and grief! it blows a man up like a\nbladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was\nSir John Bracy from your father; you must to the\ncourt in the morning. That same mad fellow of the\nnorth, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the\nbastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the\ndevil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh\nhook--what a plague call you him?\nPOINS\nO, Glendower.\nFALSTAFF\nOwen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,\nand old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of\nScots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill\nperpendicular,--\nPRINCE HENRY\nHe that rides at high speed and with his pistol\nkills a sparrow flying.\nFALSTAFF\nYou have hit it.\nPRINCE HENRY\nSo did he never the sparrow.\nFALSTAFF\nWell, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhy, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so\nfor running!\nFALSTAFF\nO' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.\nPRINCE HENRY\nYes, Jack, upon instinct.\nFALSTAFF\nI grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,\nand one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:\nWorcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's\nbeard is turned white with the news: you may buy\nland now as cheap as stinking mackerel.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhy, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and\nthis civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads\nas they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.\nFALSTAFF\nBy the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we\nshall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,\nart not thou horrible afeard? thou being\nheir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three\nsuch enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that\nspirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou\nnot horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at\nit?\nPRINCE HENRY\nNot a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.\nFALSTAFF\nWell, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou\ncomest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.\nPRINCE HENRY\nDo thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the\nparticulars of my life.\nFALSTAFF\nShall I? content: this chair shall be my state,\nthis dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden\nsceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich\ncrown for a pitiful bald crown!\nFALSTAFF\nWell, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,\nnow shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to\nmake my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have\nwept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it\nin King Cambyses' vein.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell, here is my leg.\nFALSTAFF\nAnd here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.\nHostess\nO Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!\nFALSTAFF\nWeep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.\nHostess\nO, the father, how he holds his countenance!\nFALSTAFF\nFor God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;\nFor tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.\nHostess\nO Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry\nplayers as ever I see!\nFALSTAFF\nPeace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.\nHarry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy\ntime, but also how thou art accompanied: for though\nthe camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster\nit grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the\nsooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have\npartly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,\nbut chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a\nfoolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant\nme. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;\nwhy, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall\nthe blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat\nblackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall\nthe sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a\nquestion to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,\nwhich thou hast often heard of and it is known to\nmany in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,\nas ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth\nthe company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not\nspeak to thee in drink but in tears, not in\npleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in\nwoes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I\nhave often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat manner of man, an it like your majesty?\nFALSTAFF\nA goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a\ncheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble\ncarriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,\nby'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I\nremember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man\nshould be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,\nI see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be\nknown by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,\nperemptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that\nFalstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell\nme now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast\nthou been this month?\nPRINCE HENRY\nDost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,\nand I'll play my father.\nFALSTAFF\nDepose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so\nmajestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by\nthe heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell, here I am set.\nFALSTAFF\nAnd here I stand: judge, my masters.\nPRINCE HENRY\nNow, Harry, whence come you?\nFALSTAFF\nMy noble lord, from Eastcheap.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThe complaints I hear of thee are grievous.\nFALSTAFF\n'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle\nye for a young prince, i' faith.\nPRINCE HENRY\nSwearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look\non me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:\nthere is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an\nold fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why\ndost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that\nbolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel\nof dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed\ncloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with\nthe pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that\ngrey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in\nyears? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and\ndrink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a\ncapon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?\nwherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,\nbut in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?\nFALSTAFF\nI would your grace would take me with you: whom\nmeans your grace?\nPRINCE HENRY\nThat villanous abominable misleader of youth,\nFalstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.\nFALSTAFF\nMy lord, the man I know.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI know thou dost.\nFALSTAFF\nBut to say I know more harm in him than in myself,\nwere to say more than I know. That he is old, the\nmore the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but\nthat he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,\nthat I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,\nGod help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a\nsin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if\nto be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine\nare to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,\nbanish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack\nFalstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,\nvaliant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,\nbeing, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him\nthy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's\ncompany: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI do, I will.\nA knocking heard\n\nExeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH\n\nRe-enter BARDOLPH, running\n\nBARDOLPH\nO, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most\nmonstrous watch is at the door.\nFALSTAFF\nOut, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to\nsay in the behalf of that Falstaff.\nRe-enter the Hostess\n\nHostess\nO Jesu, my lord, my lord!\nPRINCE HENRY\nHeigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:\nwhat's the matter?\nHostess\nThe sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they\nare come to search the house. Shall I let them in?\nFALSTAFF\nDost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of\ngold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,\nwithout seeming so.\nPRINCE HENRY\nAnd thou a natural coward, without instinct.\nFALSTAFF\nI deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,\nso; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart\nas well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!\nI hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.\nPRINCE HENRY\nGo, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up\nabove. Now, my masters, for a true face and good\nconscience.\nFALSTAFF\nBoth which I have had: but their date is out, and\ntherefore I'll hide me.\nPRINCE HENRY\nCall in the sheriff.\nExeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO\n\nEnter Sheriff and the Carrier\n\nNow, master sheriff, what is your will with me?\nSheriff\nFirst, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry\nHath follow'd certain men unto this house.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat men?\nSheriff\nOne of them is well known, my gracious lord,\nA gross fat man.\nCarrier\nAs fat as butter.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThe man, I do assure you, is not here;\nFor I myself at this time have employ'd him.\nAnd, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee\nThat I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,\nSend him to answer thee, or any man,\nFor any thing he shall be charged withal:\nAnd so let me entreat you leave the house.\nSheriff\nI will, my lord. There are two gentlemen\nHave in this robbery lost three hundred marks.\nPRINCE HENRY\nIt may be so: if he have robb'd these men,\nHe shall be answerable; and so farewell.\nSheriff\nGood night, my noble lord.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI think it is good morrow, is it not?\nSheriff\nIndeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.\nExeunt Sheriff and Carrier\n\nPRINCE HENRY\nThis oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,\ncall him forth.\nPETO\nFalstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and\nsnorting like a horse.\nPRINCE HENRY\nHark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.\nHe searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers\n\nWhat hast thou found?\nPETO\nNothing but papers, my lord.\nPRINCE HENRY\nLet's see what they be: read them.\nPETO\n[Reads] Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.\nItem, Sauce,. . . 4d.\nItem, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.\nItem, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.\nItem, Bread, ob.\nPRINCE HENRY\nO monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to\nthis intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,\nkeep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there\nlet him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the\nmorning. We must all to the wars, and thy place\nshall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a\ncharge of foot; and I know his death will be a\nmarch of twelve-score. The money shall be paid\nback again with advantage. Be with me betimes in\nthe morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.\nExeunt\n\nPETO\nGood morrow, good my lord.",

    "content":"ACT III\nSCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.\nEnter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER\nMORTIMER\nThese promises are fair, the parties sure,\nAnd our induction full of prosperous hope.\nHOTSPUR\nLord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,\nWill you sit down?\nAnd uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!\nI have forgot the map.\nGLENDOWER\nNo, here it is.\nSit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,\nFor by that name as oft as Lancaster\nDoth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with\nA rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.\nHOTSPUR\nAnd you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.\nGLENDOWER\nI cannot blame him: at my nativity\nThe front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\nOf burning cressets; and at my birth\nThe frame and huge foundation of the earth\nShaked like a coward.\nHOTSPUR\nWhy, so it would have done at the same season, if\nyour mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself\nhad never been born.\nGLENDOWER\nI say the earth did shake when I was born.\nHOTSPUR\nAnd I say the earth was not of my mind,\nIf you suppose as fearing you it shook.\nGLENDOWER\nThe heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.\nHOTSPUR\nO, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,\nAnd not in fear of your nativity.\nDiseased nature oftentimes breaks forth\nIn strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth\nIs with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd\nBy the imprisoning of unruly wind\nWithin her womb; which, for enlargement striving,\nShakes the old beldam earth and topples down\nSteeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth\nOur grandam earth, having this distemperature,\nIn passion shook.\nGLENDOWER\nCousin, of many men\nI do not bear these crossings. Give me leave\nTo tell you once again that at my birth\nThe front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\nThe goats ran from the mountains, and the herds\nWere strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.\nThese signs have mark'd me extraordinary;\nAnd all the courses of my life do show\nI am not in the roll of common men.\nWhere is he living, clipp'd in with the sea\nThat chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,\nWhich calls me pupil, or hath read to me?\nAnd bring him out that is but woman's son\nCan trace me in the tedious ways of art\nAnd hold me pace in deep experiments.\nHOTSPUR\nI think there's no man speaks better Welsh.\nI'll to dinner.\nMORTIMER\nPeace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.\nGLENDOWER\nI can call spirits from the vasty deep.\nHOTSPUR\nWhy, so can I, or so can any man;\nBut will they come when you do call for them?\nGLENDOWER\nWhy, I can teach you, cousin, to command\nThe devil.\nHOTSPUR\nAnd I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil\nBy telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.\nIf thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,\nAnd I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.\nO, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!\nMORTIMER\nCome, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.\nGLENDOWER\nThree times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head\nAgainst my power; thrice from the banks of Wye\nAnd sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him\nBootless home and weather-beaten back.\nHOTSPUR\nHome without boots, and in foul weather too!\nHow 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?\nGLENDOWER\nCome, here's the map: shall we divide our right\nAccording to our threefold order ta'en?\nMORTIMER\nThe archdeacon hath divided it\nInto three limits very equally:\nEngland, from Trent and Severn hitherto,\nBy south and east is to my part assign'd:\nAll westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,\nAnd all the fertile land within that bound,\nTo Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you\nThe remnant northward, lying off from Trent.\nAnd our indentures tripartite are drawn;\nWhich being sealed interchangeably,\nA business that this night may execute,\nTo-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I\nAnd my good Lord of Worcester will set forth\nTo meet your father and the Scottish power,\nAs is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.\nMy father Glendower is not ready yet,\nNot shall we need his help these fourteen days.\nWithin that space you may have drawn together\nYour tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.\nGLENDOWER\nA shorter time shall send me to you, lords:\nAnd in my conduct shall your ladies come;\nFrom whom you now must steal and take no leave,\nFor there will be a world of water shed\nUpon the parting of your wives and you.\nHOTSPUR\nMethinks my moiety, north from Burton here,\nIn quantity equals not one of yours:\nSee how this river comes me cranking in,\nAnd cuts me from the best of all my land\nA huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.\nI'll have the current in this place damm'd up;\nAnd here the smug and silver Trent shall run\nIn a new channel, fair and evenly;\nIt shall not wind with such a deep indent,\nTo rob me of so rich a bottom here.\nGLENDOWER\nNot wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.\nMORTIMER\nYea, but\nMark how he bears his course, and runs me up\nWith like advantage on the other side;\nGelding the opposed continent as much\nAs on the other side it takes from you.\nEARL OF WORCESTER\nYea, but a little charge will trench him here\nAnd on this north side win this cape of land;\nAnd then he runs straight and even.\nHOTSPUR\nI'll have it so: a little charge will do it.\nGLENDOWER\nI'll not have it alter'd.\nHOTSPUR\nWill not you?\nGLENDOWER\nNo, nor you shall not.\nHOTSPUR\nWho shall say me nay?\nGLENDOWER\nWhy, that will I.\nHOTSPUR\nLet me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.\nGLENDOWER\nI can speak English, lord, as well as you;\nFor I was train'd up in the English court;\nWhere, being but young, I framed to the harp\nMany an English ditty lovely well\nAnd gave the tongue a helpful ornament,\nA virtue that was never seen in you.\nHOTSPUR\nMarry,\nAnd I am glad of it with all my heart:\nI had rather be a kitten and cry mew\nThan one of these same metre ballad-mongers;\nI had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,\nOr a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;\nAnd that would set my teeth nothing on edge,\nNothing so much as mincing poetry:\n'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.\nGLENDOWER\nCome, you shall have Trent turn'd.\nHOTSPUR\nI do not care: I'll give thrice so much land\nTo any well-deserving friend;\nBut in the way of bargain, mark ye me,\nI'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.\nAre the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?\nGLENDOWER\nThe moon shines fair; you may away by night:\nI'll haste the writer and withal\nBreak with your wives of your departure hence:\nI am afraid my daughter will run mad,\nSo much she doteth on her Mortimer.\nExit GLENDOWER\n\nMORTIMER\nFie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!\nHOTSPUR\nI cannot choose: sometime he angers me\nWith telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,\nOf the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,\nAnd of a dragon and a finless fish,\nA clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,\nA couching lion and a ramping cat,\nAnd such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff\nAs puts me from my faith. I tell you what;\nHe held me last night at least nine hours\nIn reckoning up the several devils' names\nThat were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'\nBut mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious\nAs a tired horse, a railing wife;\nWorse than a smoky house: I had rather live\nWith cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,\nThan feed on cates and have him talk to me\nIn any summer-house in Christendom.\nMORTIMER\nIn faith, he is a worthy gentleman,\nExceedingly well read, and profited\nIn strange concealments, valiant as a lion\nAnd as wondrous affable and as bountiful\nAs mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?\nHe holds your temper in a high respect\nAnd curbs himself even of his natural scope\nWhen you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:\nI warrant you, that man is not alive\nMight so have tempted him as you have done,\nWithout the taste of danger and reproof:\nBut do not use it oft, let me entreat you.\nEARL OF WORCESTER\nIn faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;\nAnd since your coming hither have done enough\nTo put him quite beside his patience.\nYou must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:\nThough sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--\nAnd that's the dearest grace it renders you,--\nYet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,\nDefect of manners, want of government,\nPride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:\nThe least of which haunting a nobleman\nLoseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain\nUpon the beauty of all parts besides,\nBeguiling them of commendation.\nHOTSPUR\nWell, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!\nHere come our wives, and let us take our leave.\nRe-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies\n\nMORTIMER\nThis is the deadly spite that angers me;\nMy wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.\nGLENDOWER\nMy daughter weeps: she will not part with you;\nShe'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.\nMORTIMER\nGood father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy\nShall follow in your conduct speedily.\nGlendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same\n\nGLENDOWER\nShe is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,\none that no persuasion can do good upon.\nThe lady speaks in Welsh\n\nMORTIMER\nI understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh\nWhich thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens\nI am too perfect in; and, but for shame,\nIn such a parley should I answer thee.\nThe lady speaks again in Welsh\n\nI understand thy kisses and thou mine,\nAnd that's a feeling disputation:\nBut I will never be a truant, love,\nTill I have learned thy language; for thy tongue\nMakes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,\nSung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,\nWith ravishing division, to her lute.\nGLENDOWER\nNay, if you melt, then will she run mad.\nThe lady speaks again in Welsh\n\nMORTIMER\nO, I am ignorance itself in this!\nGLENDOWER\nShe bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down\nAnd rest your gentle head upon her lap,\nAnd she will sing the song that pleaseth you\nAnd on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.\nCharming your blood with pleasing heaviness,\nMaking such difference 'twixt wake and sleep\nAs is the difference betwixt day and night\nThe hour before the heavenly-harness'd team\nBegins his golden progress in the east.\nMORTIMER\nWith all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:\nBy that time will our book, I think, be drawn\nGLENDOWER\nDo so;\nAnd those musicians that shall play to you\nHang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,\nAnd straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.\nHOTSPUR\nCome, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,\nquick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.\nLADY PERCY\nGo, ye giddy goose.\nThe music plays\n\nHOTSPUR\nNow I perceive the devil understands Welsh;\nAnd 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.\nBy'r lady, he is a good musician.\nLADY PERCY\nThen should you be nothing but musical for you are\naltogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,\nand hear the lady sing in Welsh.\nHOTSPUR\nI had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.\nLADY PERCY\nWouldst thou have thy head broken?\nHOTSPUR\nNo.\nLADY PERCY\nThen be still.\nHOTSPUR\nNeither;'tis a woman's fault.\nLADY PERCY\nNow God help thee!\nHOTSPUR\nTo the Welsh lady's bed.\nLADY PERCY\nWhat's that?\nHOTSPUR\nPeace! she sings.\nHere the lady sings a Welsh song\n\nHOTSPUR\nCome, Kate, I'll have your song too.\nLADY PERCY\nNot mine, in good sooth.\nHOTSPUR\nNot yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a\ncomfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and\n'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and\n'as sure as day,'\nAnd givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,\nAs if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.\nSwear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,\nA good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'\nAnd such protest of pepper-gingerbread,\nTo velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.\nCome, sing.\nLADY PERCY\nI will not sing.\nHOTSPUR\n'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast\nteacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away\nwithin these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.\nExit\n\nGLENDOWER\nCome, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow\nAs hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.\nBy this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,\nAnd then to horse immediately.\nMORTIMER\nWith all my heart.\nExeunt",

Tell me else,\nCould such inordinate and low desires,\nSuch poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,\nSuch barren pleasures, rude society,\nAs thou art match'd withal and grafted to,\nAccompany the greatness of thy blood\nAnd hold their level with thy princely heart?\nPRINCE HENRY\nSo please your majesty, I would I could\nQuit all offences with as clear excuse\nAs well as I am doubtless I can purge\nMyself of many I am charged withal:\nYet such extenuation let me beg,\nAs, in reproof of many tales devised,\nwhich oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,\nBy smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,\nI may, for some things true, wherein my youth\nHath faulty wander'd and irregular,\nFind pardon on my true submission.\nKING HENRY IV\nGod pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,\nAt thy affections, which do hold a wing\nQuite from the flight of all thy ancestors.\nThy place in council thou hast rudely lost.\nWhich by thy younger brother is supplied,\nAnd art almost an alien to the hearts\nOf all the court and princes of my blood:\nThe hope and expectation of thy time\nIs ruin'd, and the soul of every man\nProphetically doth forethink thy fall.\nHad I so lavish of my presence been,\nSo common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,\nSo stale and cheap to vulgar company,\nOpinion, that did help me to the crown,\nHad still kept loyal to possession\nAnd left me in reputeless banishment,\nA fellow of no mark nor likelihood.\nBy being seldom seen, I could not stir\nBut like a comet I was wonder'd at;\nThat men would tell their children 'This is he;'\nOthers would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'\nAnd then I stole all courtesy from heaven,\nAnd dress'd myself in such humility\nThat I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,\nLoud shouts and salutations from their mouths,\nEven in the presence of the crowned king.\nThus did I keep my person fresh and new;\nMy presence, like a robe pontifical,\nNe'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,\nSeldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast\nAnd won by rareness such solemnity.\nThe skipping king, he ambled up and down\nWith shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,\nSoon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,\nMingled his royalty with capering fools,\nHad his great name profaned with their scorns\nAnd gave his countenance, against his name,\nTo laugh at gibing boys and stand the push\nOf every beardless vain comparative,\nGrew a companion to the common streets,\nEnfeoff'd himself to popularity;\nThat, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,\nThey surfeited with honey and began\nTo loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little\nMore than a little is by much too much.\nSo when he had occasion to be seen,\nHe was but as the cuckoo is in June,\nHeard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes\nAs, sick and blunted with community,\nAfford no extraordinary gaze,\nSuch as is bent on sun-like majesty\nWhen it shines seldom in admiring eyes;\nBut rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,\nSlept in his face and render'd such aspect\nAs cloudy men use to their adversaries,\nBeing with his presence glutted, gorged and full.\nAnd in that very line, Harry, standest thou;\nFor thou has lost thy princely privilege\nWith vile participation: not an eye\nBut is a-weary of thy common sight,\nSave mine, which hath desired to see thee more;\nWhich now doth that I would not have it do,\nMake blind itself with foolish tenderness.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,\nBe more myself.\nKING HENRY IV\nFor all the world\nAs thou art to this hour was Richard then\nWhen I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,\nAnd even as I was then is Percy now.\nNow, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,\nHe hath more worthy interest to the state\nThan thou the shadow of succession;\nFor of no right, nor colour like to right,\nHe doth fill fields with harness in the realm,\nTurns head against the lion's armed jaws,\nAnd, being no more in debt to years than thou,\nLeads ancient lords and reverend bishops on\nTo bloody battles and to bruising arms.\nWhat never-dying honour hath he got\nAgainst renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,\nWhose hot incursions and great name in arms\nHolds from all soldiers chief majority\nAnd military title capital\nThrough all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:\nThrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,\nThis infant warrior, in his enterprises\nDiscomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,\nEnlarged him and made a friend of him,\nTo fill the mouth of deep defiance up\nAnd shake the peace and safety of our throne.\nAnd what say you to this?

Why my\nskin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose\ngown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,\nI'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some\nliking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I\nshall have no strength to repent. An I have not\nforgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I\nam a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a\nchurch! Company, villanous company, hath been the\nspoil of me.\nBARDOLPH\nSir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.\nFALSTAFF\nWhy, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make\nme merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman\nneed to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not\nabove seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once\nin a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I\nborrowed, three of four times; lived well and in\ngood compass: and now I live out of all order, out\nof all compass.\nBARDOLPH\nWhy, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs\nbe out of all compass, out of all reasonable\ncompass, Sir John.\nFALSTAFF\nDo thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:\nthou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in\nthe poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the\nKnight of the Burning Lamp.\nBARDOLPH\nWhy, Sir John, my face does you no harm.\nFALSTAFF\nNo, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many\na man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I\nnever see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and\nDives that lived in purple; for there he is in his\nrobes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way\ngiven to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath\nshould be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but\nthou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but\nfor the light in thy face, the son of utter\ndarkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the\nnight to catch my horse, if I did not think thou\nhadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,\nthere's no purchase in money. O, thou art a\nperpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!\nThou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and\ntorches, walking with thee in the night betwixt\ntavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast\ndrunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap\nat the dearest chandler's in Europe.

I know\nyou, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now\nyou pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought\nyou a dozen of shirts to your back.\nFALSTAFF\nDowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to\nbakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.\nHostess\nNow, as I am a true woman, holland of eight\nshillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir\nJohn, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent\nyou, four and twenty pound.\nFALSTAFF\nHe had his part of it; let him pay.\nHostess\nHe? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.\nFALSTAFF\nHow! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?\nlet them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:\nIll not pay a denier.

Why an otter?\nFALSTAFF\nWhy, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not\nwhere to have her.\nHostess\nThou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any\nman knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!\nPRINCE HENRY\nThou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.\nHostess\nSo he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you\nought him a thousand pound.\nPRINCE HENRY\nSirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?\nFALSTAFF\nA thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth\na million: thou owest me thy love.\nHostess\nNay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would\ncudgel you.\nFALSTAFF\nDid I, Bardolph?\nBARDOLPH\nIndeed, Sir John, you said so.\nFALSTAFF\nYea, if he said my ring was copper.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?\nFALSTAFF\nWhy, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:\nbut as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the\nroaring of a lion's whelp.\nPRINCE HENRY\nAnd why not as the lion?\nFALSTAFF\nThe king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou\nthink I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an\nI do, I pray God my girdle break.\nPRINCE HENRY\nO, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy\nknees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,\ntruth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all\nfilled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest\nwoman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,\nimpudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in\nthy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of\nbawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of\nsugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket\nwere enriched with any other injuries but these, I\nam a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will\nnot pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?\nFALSTAFF\nDost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of\ninnocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack\nFalstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I\nhave more flesh than another man, and therefore more\nfrailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?\nPRINCE HENRY\nIt appears so by the story.\nFALSTAFF\nHostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;\nlove thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy\nguests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest\nreason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,\nprithee, be gone.\nExit Hostess\n\nNow Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,\nlad, how is that answered?\nPRINCE HENRY\nO, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to\nthee: the money is paid back again.\nFALSTAFF\nO, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI am good friends with my father and may do any thing.\nFALSTAFF\nRob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and\ndo it with unwashed hands too.\nBARDOLPH\nDo, my lord.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.\nFALSTAFF\nI would it had been of horse. Where shall I find\none that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the\nage of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am\nheinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for\nthese rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I\nlaud them, I praise them.\nPRINCE HENRY\nBardolph!\nBARDOLPH\nMy lord?\nPRINCE HENRY\nGo bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my\nbrother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.\nExit Bardolph\n\nGo, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have\nthirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.\nExit Peto\n\nJack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two\no'clock in the afternoon.\nThere shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive\nMoney and order for their furniture.\nThe land is burning; Percy stands on high;\nAnd either we or they must lower lie.\nExit PRINCE HENRY\n\nFALSTAFF\nRare words! brave world!

I am on fire\nTo hear this rich reprisal is so nigh\nAnd yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,\nWho is to bear me like a thunderbolt\nAgainst the bosom of the Prince of Wales:\nHarry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,\nMeet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.\nO that Glendower were come!\nVERNON\nThere is more news:\nI learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,\nHe cannot draw his power this fourteen days.\nEARL OF DOUGLAS\nThat's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.\nWORCESTER\nAy, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.\nHOTSPUR\nWhat may the king's whole battle reach unto?\nVERNON\nTo thirty thousand.\nHOTSPUR\nForty let it be:\nMy father and Glendower being both away,\nThe powers of us may serve so great a day\nCome, let us take a muster speedily:\nDoomsday is near; die all, die merrily.\nEARL OF DOUGLAS\nTalk not of dying: I am out of fear\nOf death or death's hand for this one-half year.\nExeunt",

I press me\nnone but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire\nme out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked\ntwice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,\nas had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as\nfear the report of a caliver worse than a struck\nfowl or a hurt wild-duck.

Tell your nephew,\nThe Prince of Wales doth join with all the world\nIn praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,\nThis present enterprise set off his head,\nI do not think a braver gentleman,\nMore active-valiant or more valiant-young,\nMore daring or more bold, is now alive\nTo grace this latter age with noble deeds.\nFor my part, I may speak it to my shame,\nI have a truant been to chivalry;\nAnd so I hear he doth account me too;\nYet this before my father's majesty--\nI am content that he shall take the odds\nOf his great name and estimation,\nAnd will, to save the blood on either side,\nTry fortune with him in a single fight.\nKING HENRY IV\nAnd, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,\nAlbeit considerations infinite\nDo make against it. No, good Worcester, no,\nWe love our people well; even those we love\nThat are misled upon your cousin's part;\nAnd, will they take the offer of our grace,\nBoth he and they and you, every man\nShall be my friend again and I'll be his:\nSo tell your cousin, and bring me word\nWhat he will do: but if he will not yield,\nRebuke and dread correction wait on us\nAnd they shall do their office. So, be gone;\nWe will not now be troubled with reply:\nWe offer fair; take it advisedly.\nExeunt WORCESTER and VERNON\n\nPRINCE HENRY\nIt will not be accepted, on my life:\nThe Douglas and the Hotspur both together\nAre confident against the world in arms.\nKING HENRY IV\nHence, therefore, every leader to his charge;\nFor, on their answer, will we set on them:\nAnd God befriend us, as our cause is just!\nExeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF\n\nFALSTAFF\nHal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride\nme, so; 'tis a point of friendship.\nPRINCE HENRY\nNothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.\nSay thy prayers, and farewell.\nFALSTAFF\nI would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhy, thou owest God a death.\nExit PRINCE HENRY\n\nFALSTAFF\n'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before\nhis day. What need I be so forward with him that\ncalls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks\nme on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I\ncome on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or\nan arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.\nHonour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is\nhonour? a word. What is in that word honour? what\nis that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?\nhe that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.\nDoth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,\nto the dead. But will it not live with the living?\nno. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore\nI'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so\nends my catechism.\nExit",
