But all’s too weak;\nFor brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),\nDisdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,\nWhich smok’d with bloody execution,\nLike Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,\nTill he fac’d the slave;\nWhich ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\nTill he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,\nAnd fix’d his head upon our battlements.\n\nDUNCAN.\nO valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!\n\nSOLDIER.\nAs whence the sun ’gins his reflection\nShipwracking storms and direful thunders break,\nSo from that spring, whence comfort seem’d to come\nDiscomfort swells.

As thick as tale\nCame post with post; and everyone did bear\nThy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,\nAnd pour’d them down before him.\n\nANGUS.\nWe are sent\nTo give thee from our royal master thanks;\nOnly to herald thee into his sight,\nNot pay thee.\n\nROSS.\nAnd, for an earnest of a greater honour,\nHe bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\nIn which addition, hail, most worthy thane,\nFor it is thine.\n\nBANQUO.\nWhat, can the devil speak true?\n\nMACBETH.\nThe Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me\nIn borrow’d robes?\n\nANGUS.\nWho was the Thane lives yet,\nBut under heavy judgement bears that life\nWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’d\nWith those of Norway, or did line the rebel\nWith hidden help and vantage, or that with both\nHe labour’d in his country’s wrack, I know not;\nBut treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,\nHave overthrown him.\n\nMACBETH.\n[Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:\nThe greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus.] Thanks for your pains.\n[To Banquo.] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,\nWhen those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\nPromis’d no less to them?\n\nBANQUO.\nThat, trusted home,\nMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange:\nAnd oftentimes to win us to our harm,\nThe instruments of darkness tell us truths;\nWin us with honest trifles, to betray’s\nIn deepest consequence.—\nCousins, a word, I pray you.\n\nMACBETH.\n[Aside.] Two truths are told,\nAs happy prologues to the swelling act\nOf the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.—\n[Aside.] This supernatural soliciting\nCannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,\nWhy hath it given me earnest of success,\nCommencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:\nIf good, why do I yield to that suggestion\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair,\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\nAgainst the use of nature? Present fears\nAre less than horrible imaginings.\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\nShakes so my single state of man\nThat function is smother’d in surmise,\nAnd nothing is but what is not.\n\nBANQUO.\nLook, how our partner’s rapt.\n\nMACBETH.\n[Aside.] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me\nWithout my stir.\n\nBANQUO.\nNew honours come upon him,\nLike our strange garments, cleave not to their mould\nBut with the aid of use.\n\nMACBETH.\n[Aside.] Come what come may,\nTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.\n\nBANQUO.\nWorthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\n\nMACBETH.\nGive me your favour. My dull brain was wrought\nWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\nAre register’d where every day I turn\nThe leaf to read them.—Let us toward the King.—\nThink upon what hath chanc’d; and at more time,\nThe interim having weigh’d it, let us speak\nOur free hearts each to other.\n\nBANQUO.\nVery gladly.\n\nMACBETH.\nTill then, enough.—Come, friends.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought good to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”\n\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\nWhat thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;\nIt is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;\nArt not without ambition, but without\nThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have, great Glamis,\nThat which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do,\nThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear,\nAnd chastise with the valour of my tongue\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\nTo have thee crown’d withal.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nWhat is your tidings?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe King comes here tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nThou’rt mad to say it.\nIs not thy master with him? who, were’t so,\nWould have inform’d for preparation.\n\nMESSENGER.\nSo please you, it is true.

Come to my woman’s breasts,\nAnd take my milk for gall, your murd’ring ministers,\nWherever in your sightless substances\nYou wait on nature’s mischief! Come, thick night,\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell\nThat my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\nNor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark\nTo cry, “Hold, hold!”\n\nEnter Macbeth.\n\nGreat Glamis, worthy Cawdor!\nGreater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\nThy letters have transported me beyond\nThis ignorant present, and I feel now\nThe future in the instant.\n\nMACBETH.\nMy dearest love,\nDuncan comes here tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nAnd when goes hence?\n\nMACBETH.\nTomorrow, as he purposes.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nO, never\nShall sun that morrow see!\nYour face, my thane, is as a book where men\nMay read strange matters.

Art thou afeard\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\nWhich thou esteem’st the ornament of life,\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\nLetting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”\nLike the poor cat i’ th’ adage?\n\nMACBETH.\nPr’ythee, peace!\nI dare do all that may become a man;\nWho dares do more is none.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWhat beast was’t, then,\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\nHow tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\nHave pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums\nAnd dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you\nHave done to this.\n\nMACBETH.\nIf we should fail?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWe fail?\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\nAnd we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\n(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey\nSoundly invite him), his two chamberlains\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\nA limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\nTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon\nTh’ unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\nHis spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt\nOf our great quell?\n\nMACBETH.\nBring forth men-children only;\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose\nNothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,\nWhen we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two\nOf his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,\nThat they have done’t?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWho dares receive it other,\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\nUpon his death?\n\nMACBETH.\nI am settled, and bend up\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show:\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth know.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

[Knocking.] Knock, knock, knock. Who’s there, i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here you’ll sweat for’t. [Knocking.] Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’ th’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator.

Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\n\nPORTER.\nThat it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.\n\nMACDUFF.\nIs thy master stirring?\nEnter Macbeth.\n\nOur knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.\n\nLENNOX.\nGood morrow, noble sir!\n\nMACBETH.\nGood morrow, both!\n\nMACDUFF.\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\n\nMACBETH.\nNot yet.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\nI have almost slipp’d the hour.\n\nMACBETH.\nI’ll bring you to him.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you;\nBut yet ’tis one.\n\nMACBETH.\nThe labour we delight in physics pain.\nThis is the door.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI’ll make so bold to call.\nFor ’tis my limited service.\n\n[Exit Macduff.]\n\nLENNOX.\nGoes the King hence today?\n\nMACBETH.\nHe does. He did appoint so.\n\nLENNOX.\nThe night has been unruly: where we lay,\nOur chimneys were blown down and, as they say,\nLamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death,\nAnd prophesying, with accents terrible,\nOf dire combustion and confus’d events,\nNew hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure bird\nClamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earth\nWas feverous, and did shake.\n\nMACBETH.\n’Twas a rough night.\n\nLENNOX.\nMy young remembrance cannot parallel\nA fellow to it.\n\nEnter Macduff.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO horror, horror, horror!\nTongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!\n\nMACBETH, LENNOX.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nMACDUFF.\nConfusion now hath made his masterpiece!\nMost sacrilegious murder hath broke ope\nThe Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence\nThe life o’ th’ building.\n\nMACBETH.\nWhat is’t you say? the life?\n\nLENNOX.\nMean you his majesty?\n\nMACDUFF.\nApproach the chamber, and destroy your sight\nWith a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.\nSee, and then speak yourselves.\n\n[Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox.]\n\nAwake, awake!—\nRing the alarum bell.—Murder and treason!\nBanquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!\nShake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit,\nAnd look on death itself! Up, up, and see\nThe great doom’s image. Malcolm! Banquo!\nAs from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites\nTo countenance this horror!\n\n[Alarum-bell rings.]\n\nEnter Lady Macbeth.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWhat’s the business,\nThat such a hideous trumpet calls to parley\nThe sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!\n\nMACDUFF.\nO gentle lady,\n’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:\nThe repetition, in a woman’s ear,\nWould murder as it fell.\n\nEnter Banquo.\n\nO Banquo, Banquo!\nOur royal master’s murder’d!\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWoe, alas!\nWhat, in our house?\n\nBANQUO.\nToo cruel anywhere.—\nDear Duff, I pr’ythee, contradict thyself,\nAnd say it is not so.\n\nEnter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross.\n\nMACBETH.\nHad I but died an hour before this chance,\nI had liv’d a blessed time; for, from this instant\nThere’s nothing serious in mortality.\nAll is but toys: renown and grace is dead;\nThe wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees\nIs left this vault to brag of.\n\nEnter Malcolm and Donalbain.\n\nDONALBAIN.\nWhat is amiss?\n\nMACBETH.\nYou are, and do not know’t:\nThe spring, the head, the fountain of your blood\nIs stopp’d; the very source of it is stopp’d.\n\nMACDUFF.\nYour royal father’s murder’d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nO, by whom?\n\nLENNOX.\nThose of his chamber, as it seem’d, had done’t:\nTheir hands and faces were all badg’d with blood;\nSo were their daggers, which, unwip’d, we found\nUpon their pillows. They star’d, and were distracted;\nNo man’s life was to be trusted with them.\n\nMACBETH.\nO, yet I do repent me of my fury,\nThat I did kill them.\n\nMACDUFF.\nWherefore did you so?\n\nMACBETH.\nWho can be wise, amaz’d, temperate, and furious,\nLoyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:\nTh’ expedition of my violent love\nOutrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,\nHis silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;\nAnd his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature\nFor ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,\nSteep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers\nUnmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart\nCourage to make’s love known?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nHelp me hence, ho!\n\nMACDUFF.\nLook to the lady.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWhy do we hold our tongues,\nThat most may claim this argument for ours?\n\nDONALBAIN.\nWhat should be spoken here, where our fate,\nHid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?\nLet’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nNor our strong sorrow\nUpon the foot of motion.\n\nBANQUO.\nLook to the lady:—\n\n[Lady Macbeth is carried out.]\n\nAnd when we have our naked frailties hid,\nThat suffer in exposure, let us meet,\nAnd question this most bloody piece of work\nTo know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:\nIn the great hand of God I stand; and thence\nAgainst the undivulg’d pretence I fight\nOf treasonous malice.\n\nMACDUFF.\nAnd so do I.\n\nALL.\nSo all.\n\nMACBETH.\nLet’s briefly put on manly readiness,\nAnd meet i’ th’ hall together.\n\nALL.\nWell contented.\n\n[Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.]\n\nMALCOLM.\nWhat will you do? Let’s not consort with them:\nTo show an unfelt sorrow is an office\nWhich the false man does easy. I’ll to England.\n\nDONALBAIN.\nTo Ireland, I. Our separated fortune\nShall keep us both the safer. Where we are,\nThere’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood,\nThe nearer bloody.\n\nMALCOLM.\nThis murderous shaft that’s shot\nHath not yet lighted; and our safest way\nIs to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;\nAnd let us not be dainty of leave-taking,\nBut shift away. There’s warrant in that theft\nWhich steals itself, when there’s no mercy left.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

If there come truth from them\n(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)\nWhy, by the verities on thee made good,\nMay they not be my oracles as well,\nAnd set me up in hope?

Know\nThat it was he, in the times past, which held you\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been\nOur innocent self? This I made good to you\nIn our last conference, pass’d in probation with you\nHow you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that might\nTo half a soul and to a notion craz’d\nSay, “Thus did Banquo.”\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nYou made it known to us.\n\nMACBETH.\nI did so; and went further, which is now\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find\nYour patience so predominant in your nature,\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\nWhose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,\nAnd beggar’d yours forever?\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nWe are men, my liege.\n\nMACBETH.\nAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;\nAs hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\nAll by the name of dogs: the valu’d file\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\nHath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive\nParticular addition, from the bill\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\nNot i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\nWhich in his death were perfect.\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nI am one, my liege,\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\nHath so incens’d that I am reckless what\nI do to spite the world.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nAnd I another,\nSo weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\nTo mend it or be rid on’t.\n\nMACBETH.\nBoth of you\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\n\nBOTH MURDERERS.\nTrue, my lord.\n\nMACBETH.\nSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\nAgainst my near’st of life; and though I could\nWith barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\nWho I myself struck down: and thence it is\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\nMasking the business from the common eye\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\n\nSECOND MURDERER.\nWe shall, my lord,\nPerform what you command us.\n\nFIRST MURDERER.\nThough our lives—\n\nMACBETH.\nYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves,\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,\nThe moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\nThat I require a clearness. And with him\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\nWhose absence is no less material to me\nThan is his father’s, must embrace the fate\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\nI’ll come to you anon.\n\nBOTH MURDERERS.\nWe are resolv’d, my lord.\n\nMACBETH.\nI’ll call upon you straight: abide within.\n\n[Exeunt Murderers.]\n\nIt is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,\nIf it find heaven, must find it out tonight.\n\n[Exit.]",

At first\nAnd last the hearty welcome.\n\nLORDS.\nThanks to your Majesty.\n\nMACBETH.\nOurself will mingle with society,\nAnd play the humble host.\nOur hostess keeps her state; but, in best time,\nWe will require her welcome.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nPronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;\nFor my heart speaks they are welcome.\n\nEnter first Murderer to the door.\n\nMACBETH.\nSee, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.\nBoth sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.\n\nBe large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure\nThe table round. There’s blood upon thy face.\n\nMURDERER.\n’Tis Banquo’s then.\n\nMACBETH.\n’Tis better thee without than he within.\nIs he dispatch’d?\n\nMURDERER.\nMy lord, his throat is cut.

But Banquo’s safe?\n\nMURDERER.\nAy, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\nThe least a death to nature.\n\nMACBETH.\nThanks for that.\nThere the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\nNo teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow\nWe’ll hear, ourselves, again.\n\n[Exit Murderer.]\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nMy royal lord,\nYou do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\nThat is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,\n’Tis given with welcome.

O, these flaws, and starts\n(Impostors to true fear), would well become\nA woman’s story at a winter’s fire,\nAuthoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself!\nWhy do you make such faces? When all’s done,\nYou look but on a stool.\n\nMACBETH.\nPr’ythee, see there!\nBehold! look! lo! how say you?\nWhy, what care I?

This is more strange\nThan such a murder is.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nMy worthy lord,\nYour noble friends do lack you.\n\nMACBETH.\nI do forget.—\nDo not muse at me, my most worthy friends.\nI have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\nTo those that know me. Come, love and health to all;\nThen I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine, fill full.—\nI drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table,\nAnd to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss:\nWould he were here.\n\nGhost rises again.\n\nTo all, and him, we thirst,\nAnd all to all.\n\nLORDS.\nOur duties, and the pledge.\n\nMACBETH.\nAvaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!\nThy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\nWhich thou dost glare with!\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nThink of this, good peers,\nBut as a thing of custom: ’tis no other,\nOnly it spoils the pleasure of the time.\n\nMACBETH.\nWhat man dare, I dare:\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\nThe arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger;\nTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\nShall never tremble: or be alive again,\nAnd dare me to the desert with thy sword;\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest me\nThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\nUnreal mock’ry, hence!\n\n[Ghost disappears.]\n\nWhy, so;—being gone,\nI am a man again.—Pray you, sit still.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nYou have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting\nWith most admir’d disorder.\n\nMACBETH.\nCan such things be,\nAnd overcome us like a summer’s cloud,\nWithout our special wonder? You make me strange\nEven to the disposition that I owe,\nWhen now I think you can behold such sights,\nAnd keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,\nWhen mine are blanch’d with fear.\n\nROSS.\nWhat sights, my lord?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nI pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;\nQuestion enrages him. At once, good night:—\nStand not upon the order of your going,\nBut go at once.\n\nLENNOX.\nGood night; and better health\nAttend his Majesty!\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nA kind good night to all!\n\n[Exeunt all Lords and Attendants.]\n\nMACBETH.\nIt will have blood, they say, blood will have blood.\nStones have been known to move, and trees to speak;\nAugurs, and understood relations, have\nBy magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth\nThe secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nAlmost at odds with morning, which is which.\n\nMACBETH.\nHow say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person\nAt our great bidding?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nDid you send to him, sir?\n\nMACBETH.\nI hear it by the way; but I will send.\nThere’s not a one of them but in his house\nI keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow\n(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters:\nMore shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,\nBy the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,\nAll causes shall give way: I am in blood\nStepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,\nReturning were as tedious as go o’er.\nStrange things I have in head, that will to hand,\nWhich must be acted ere they may be scann’d.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nYou lack the season of all natures, sleep.\n\nMACBETH.\nCome, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse\nIs the initiate fear that wants hard use.\nWe are yet but young in deed.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Down!\nThy crown does sear mine eyeballs:—and thy hair,\nThou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.\nA third is like the former.—Filthy hags!\nWhy do you show me this?—A fourth!—Start, eyes!\nWhat, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom?\nAnother yet!—A seventh!—I’ll see no more:—\nAnd yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass\nWhich shows me many more; and some I see\nThat twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.\nHorrible sight!—Now I see ’tis true;\nFor the blood-bolter’d Banquo smiles upon me,\nAnd points at them for his.—What! is this so?\n\nFIRST WITCH.\nAy, sir, all this is so:—but why\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?—\nCome, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,\nAnd show the best of our delights.\nI’ll charm the air to give a sound,\nWhile you perform your antic round;\nThat this great king may kindly say,\nOur duties did his welcome pay.\n\n[Music. The Witches dance, and vanish.]\n\nMACBETH.\nWhere are they? Gone?—Let this pernicious hour\nStand aye accursed in the calendar!—\nCome in, without there!\n\nEnter Lennox.\n\nLENNOX.\nWhat’s your Grace’s will?\n\nMACBETH.\nSaw you the Weird Sisters?\n\nLENNOX.\nNo, my lord.\n\nMACBETH.\nCame they not by you?\n\nLENNOX.\nNo, indeed, my lord.\n\nMACBETH.\nInfected be the air whereon they ride;\nAnd damn’d all those that trust them!—I did hear\nThe galloping of horse: who was’t came by?\n\nLENNOX.\n’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word\nMacduff is fled to England.\n\nMACBETH.\nFled to England!\n\nLENNOX.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nMACBETH.\nTime, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits:\nThe flighty purpose never is o’ertook\nUnless the deed go with it. From this moment\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\nThe firstlings of my hand. And even now,\nTo crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:\nThe castle of Macduff I will surprise;\nSeize upon Fife; give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword\nHis wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls\nThat trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;\nThis deed I’ll do before this purpose cool:\nBut no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?\nCome, bring me where they are.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. England. Before the King’s Palace.\nEnter Malcolm and Macduff.\n\nMALCOLM.\nLet us seek out some desolate shade and there\nWeep our sad bosoms empty.\n\nMACDUFF.\nLet us rather\nHold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,\nBestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new morn\nNew widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows\nStrike heaven on the face, that it resounds\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out\nLike syllable of dolour.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWhat I believe, I’ll wail;\nWhat know, believe; and what I can redress,\nAs I shall find the time to friend, I will.\nWhat you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.\nThis tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\nWas once thought honest: you have loved him well;\nHe hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something\nYou may deserve of him through me; and wisdom\nTo offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb\nTo appease an angry god.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI am not treacherous.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBut Macbeth is.\nA good and virtuous nature may recoil\nIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell:\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\nYet grace must still look so.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI have lost my hopes.\n\nMALCOLM.\nPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\nWithout leave-taking?—I pray you,\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonours,\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\nWhatever I shall think.\n\nMACDUFF.\nBleed, bleed, poor country!\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\nFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;\nThe title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:\nI would not be the villain that thou think’st\nFor the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp\nAnd the rich East to boot.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe not offended:\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\nIs added to her wounds. I think, withal,\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\nAnd here, from gracious England, have I offer\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\nShall have more vices than it had before,\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\nBy him that shall succeed.\n\nMACDUFF.\nWhat should he be?\n\nMALCOLM.\nIt is myself I mean; in whom I know\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\nThat, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth\nWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor state\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compar’d\nWith my confineless harms.\n\nMACDUFF.\nNot in the legions\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\n\nMALCOLM.\nI grant him bloody,\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\nThat has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\nThe cistern of my lust; and my desire\nAll continent impediments would o’erbear,\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\nThan such an one to reign.\n\nMACDUFF.\nBoundless intemperance\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\nTh’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\nTo take upon you what is yours: you may\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\nAnd yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.\nWe have willing dames enough; there cannot be\nThat vulture in you, to devour so many\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\nFinding it so inclin’d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWith this there grows\nIn my most ill-compos’d affection such\nA staunchless avarice, that, were I king,\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands;\nDesire his jewels, and this other’s house:\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\nTo make me hunger more; that I should forge\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\nDestroying them for wealth.\n\nMACDUFF.\nThis avarice\nSticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root\nThan summer-seeming lust; and it hath been\nThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will,\nOf your mere own. All these are portable,\nWith other graces weigh’d.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBut I have none: the king-becoming graces,\nAs justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\nI have no relish of them; but abound\nIn the division of each several crime,\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\nUproar the universal peace, confound\nAll unity on earth.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO Scotland, Scotland!\n\nMALCOLM.\nIf such a one be fit to govern, speak:\nI am as I have spoken.\n\nMACDUFF.\nFit to govern?\nNo, not to live.—O nation miserable,\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\nBy his own interdiction stands accus’d,\nAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\nWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,\nOft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!\nThese evils thou repeat’st upon thyself\nHave banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,\nThy hope ends here!\n\nMALCOLM.\nMacduff, this noble passion,\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\nWiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts\nTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\nFrom over-credulous haste: but God above\nDeal between thee and me! for even now\nI put myself to thy direction, and\nUnspeak mine own detraction; here abjure\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\nUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own;\nAt no time broke my faith; would not betray\nThe devil to his fellow; and delight\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly,\nIs thine and my poor country’s to command:\nWhither, indeed, before thy here-approach,\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\nNow we’ll together, and the chance of goodness\nBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?\n\nMACDUFF.\nSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once\n’Tis hard to reconcile.\n\nEnter a Doctor.\n\nMALCOLM.\nWell; more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?\n\nDOCTOR.\nAy, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls\nThat stay his cure: their malady convinces\nThe great assay of art; but at his touch,\nSuch sanctity hath heaven given his hand,\nThey presently amend.\n\nMALCOLM.\nI thank you, doctor.\n\n[Exit Doctor.]\n\nMACDUFF.\nWhat’s the disease he means?\n\nMALCOLM.\n’Tis call’d the evil:\nA most miraculous work in this good king;\nWhich often, since my here-remain in England,\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\nHimself best knows, but strangely-visited people,\nAll swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures;\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\nPut on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne,\nThat speak him full of grace.\n\nEnter Ross.\n\nMACDUFF.\nSee, who comes here?\n\nMALCOLM.\nMy countryman; but yet I know him not.\n\nMACDUFF.\nMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\n\nMALCOLM.\nI know him now. Good God, betimes remove\nThe means that makes us strangers!\n\nROSS.\nSir, amen.\n\nMACDUFF.\nStands Scotland where it did?\n\nROSS.\nAlas, poor country,\nAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannot\nBe call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,\nAre made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems\nA modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell\nIs there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\nDying or ere they sicken.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO, relation\nToo nice, and yet too true!\n\nMALCOLM.\nWhat’s the newest grief?\n\nROSS.\nThat of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;\nEach minute teems a new one.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHow does my wife?\n\nROSS.\nWhy, well.\n\nMACDUFF.\nAnd all my children?\n\nROSS.\nWell too.\n\nMACDUFF.\nThe tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?\n\nROSS.\nNo; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.\n\nMACDUFF.\nBe not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?\n\nROSS.\nWhen I came hither to transport the tidings,\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\nOf many worthy fellows that were out;\nWhich was to my belief witness’d the rather,\nFor that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.\nNow is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight,\nTo doff their dire distresses.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe’t their comfort\nWe are coming thither. Gracious England hath\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\nAn older and a better soldier none\nThat Christendom gives out.\n\nROSS.\nWould I could answer\nThis comfort with the like! But I have words\nThat would be howl’d out in the desert air,\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\n\nMACDUFF.\nWhat concern they?\nThe general cause? or is it a fee-grief\nDue to some single breast?\n\nROSS.\nNo mind that’s honest\nBut in it shares some woe, though the main part\nPertains to you alone.\n\nMACDUFF.\nIf it be mine,\nKeep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\n\nROSS.\nLet not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\nThat ever yet they heard.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHumh! I guess at it.\n\nROSS.\nYour castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes\nSavagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner\nWere, on the quarry of these murder’d deer,\nTo add the death of you.\n\nMALCOLM.\nMerciful heaven!—\nWhat, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\nWhispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\n\nMACDUFF.\nMy children too?\n\nROSS.\nWife, children, servants, all\nThat could be found.\n\nMACDUFF.\nAnd I must be from thence!\nMy wife kill’d too?\n\nROSS.\nI have said.\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe comforted:\nLet’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,\nTo cure this deadly grief.\n\nMACDUFF.\nHe has no children.—All my pretty ones?\nDid you say all?—O hell-kite!—All?\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\nAt one fell swoop?\n\nMALCOLM.\nDispute it like a man.\n\nMACDUFF.\nI shall do so;\nBut I must also feel it as a man:\nI cannot but remember such things were,\nThat were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\nThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine,\nFell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!\n\nMALCOLM.\nBe this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\nConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\n\nMACDUFF.\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\nAnd braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens,\nCut short all intermission; front to front,\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\nWithin my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,\nHeaven forgive him too!\n\nMALCOLM.\nThis tune goes manly.\nCome, go we to the King. Our power is ready;\nOur lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\nPut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;\nThe night is long that never finds the day.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nOut, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\n\nDOCTOR.\nDo you mark that?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nThe Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that: you mar all with this starting.\n\nDOCTOR.\nGo to, go to. You have known what you should not.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nShe has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nHere’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!\n\nDOCTOR.\nWhat a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nI would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.\n\nDOCTOR.\nWell, well, well.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nPray God it be, sir.\n\nDOCTOR.\nThis disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nWash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.\n\nDOCTOR.\nEven so?\n\nLADY MACBETH.\nTo bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDOCTOR.\nWill she go now to bed?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nDirectly.\n\nDOCTOR.\nFoul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds\nDo breed unnatural troubles: infected minds\nTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.\nMore needs she the divine than the physician.—\nGod, God, forgive us all! Look after her;\nRemove from her the means of all annoyance,\nAnd still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:\nMy mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight.\nI think, but dare not speak.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nGood night, good doctor.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
