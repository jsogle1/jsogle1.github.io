    "content":"None\nWarkworth. Before the castle\nEnter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues\nRUMOUR\nOpen your ears; for which of you will stop\nThe vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?\nI, from the orient to the drooping west,\nMaking the wind my post-horse, still unfold\nThe acts commenced on this ball of earth:\nUpon my tongues continual slanders ride,\nThe which in every language I pronounce,\nStuffing the ears of men with false reports.\nI speak of peace, while covert enmity\nUnder the smile of safety wounds the world:\nAnd who but Rumour, who but only I,\nMake fearful musters and prepared defence,\nWhiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,\nIs thought with child by the stern tyrant war,\nAnd no such matter? Rumour is a pipe\nBlown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures\nAnd of so easy and so plain a stop\nThat the blunt monster with uncounted heads,\nThe still-discordant wavering multitude,\nCan play upon it. But what need I thus\nMy well-known body to anatomize\nAmong my household? Why is Rumour here?\nI run before King Harry's victory;\nWho in a bloody field by Shrewsbury\nHath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,\nQuenching the flame of bold rebellion\nEven with the rebel's blood. But what mean I\nTo speak so true at first? my office is\nTo noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell\nUnder the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,\nAnd that the king before the Douglas' rage\nStoop'd his anointed head as low as death.\nThis have I rumour'd through the peasant towns\nBetween that royal field of Shrewsbury\nAnd this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,\nWhere Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,\nLies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,\nAnd not a man of them brings other news\nThan they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues\nThey bring smooth comforts false, worse than\ntrue wrongs.\nExit",

After him came spurring hard\nA gentleman, almost forspent with speed,\nThat stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.\nHe ask'd the way to Chester; and of him\nI did demand what news from Shrewsbury:\nHe told me that rebellion had bad luck\nAnd that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.\nWith that, he gave his able horse the head,\nAnd bending forward struck his armed heels\nAgainst the panting sides of his poor jade\nUp to the rowel-head, and starting so\nHe seem'd in running to devour the way,\nStaying no longer question.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nHa! Again:\nSaid he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?\nOf Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion\nHad met ill luck?\nLORD BARDOLPH\nMy lord, I'll tell you what;\nIf my young lord your son have not the day,\nUpon mine honour, for a silken point\nI'll give my barony: never talk of it.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nWhy should that gentleman that rode by Travers\nGive then such instances of loss?\nLORD BARDOLPH\nWho, he?\nHe was some hilding fellow that had stolen\nThe horse he rode on, and, upon my life,\nSpoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.\nEnter MORTON\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nYea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,\nForetells the nature of a tragic volume:\nSo looks the strand whereon the imperious flood\nHath left a witness'd usurpation.\nSay, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?\nMORTON\nI ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;\nWhere hateful death put on his ugliest mask\nTo fright our party.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nHow doth my son and brother?\nThou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek\nIs apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.\nEven such a man, so faint, so spiritless,\nSo dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,\nDrew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,\nAnd would have told him half his Troy was burnt;\nBut Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,\nAnd I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.\nThis thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;\nYour brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'\nStopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:\nBut in the end, to stop my ear indeed,\nThou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,\nEnding with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'\nMORTON\nDouglas is living, and your brother, yet;\nBut, for my lord your son--\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nWhy, he is dead.\nSee what a ready tongue suspicion hath!\nHe that but fears the thing he would not know\nHath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes\nThat what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;\nTell thou an earl his divination lies,\nAnd I will take it as a sweet disgrace\nAnd make thee rich for doing me such wrong.\nMORTON\nYou are too great to be by me gainsaid:\nYour spirit is too true, your fears too certain.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nYet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.\nI see a strange confession in thine eye:\nThou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin\nTo speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;\nThe tongue offends not that reports his death:\nAnd he doth sin that doth belie the dead,\nNot he which says the dead is not alive.\nYet the first bringer of unwelcome news\nHath but a losing office, and his tongue\nSounds ever after as a sullen bell,\nRemember'd tolling a departing friend.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nI cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.\nMORTON\nI am sorry I should force you to believe\nThat which I would to God I had not seen;\nBut these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,\nRendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,\nTo Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down\nThe never-daunted Percy to the earth,\nFrom whence with life he never more sprung up.\nIn few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire\nEven to the dullest peasant in his camp,\nBeing bruited once, took fire and heat away\nFrom the best temper'd courage in his troops;\nFor from his metal was his party steel'd;\nWhich once in him abated, all the rest\nTurn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:\nAnd as the thing that's heavy in itself,\nUpon enforcement flies with greatest speed,\nSo did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,\nLend to this weight such lightness with their fear\nThat arrows fled not swifter toward their aim\nThan did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,\nFly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester\nToo soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,\nThe bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword\nHad three times slain the appearance of the king,\n'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame\nOf those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,\nStumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all\nIs that the king hath won, and hath sent out\nA speedy power to encounter you, my lord,\nUnder the conduct of young Lancaster\nAnd Westmoreland. This is the news at full.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nFor this I shall have time enough to mourn.\nIn poison there is physic; and these news,\nHaving been well, that would have made me sick,\nBeing sick, have in some measure made me well:\nAnd as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,\nLike strengthless hinges, buckle under life,\nImpatient of his fit, breaks like a fire\nOut of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,\nWeaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,\nAre thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!\nA scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel\nMust glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!\nThou art a guard too wanton for the head\nWhich princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.\nNow bind my brows with iron; and approach\nThe ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring\nTo frown upon the enraged Northumberland!\nLet heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand\nKeep the wild flood confined! let order die!\nAnd let this world no longer be a stage\nTo feed contention in a lingering act;\nBut let one spirit of the first-born Cain\nReign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set\nOn bloody courses, the rude scene may end,\nAnd darkness be the burier of the dead!\nTRAVERS\nThis strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nSweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.\nMORTON\nThe lives of all your loving complices\nLean on your health; the which, if you give o'er\nTo stormy passion, must perforce decay.\nYou cast the event of war, my noble lord,\nAnd summ'd the account of chance, before you said\n'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,\nThat, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:\nYou knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,\nMore likely to fall in than to get o'er;\nYou were advised his flesh was capable\nOf wounds and scars and that his forward spirit\nWould lift him where most trade of danger ranged:\nYet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,\nThough strongly apprehended, could restrain\nThe stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,\nOr what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,\nMore than that being which was like to be?\nLORD BARDOLPH\nWe all that are engaged to this loss\nKnew that we ventured on such dangerous seas\nThat if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;\nAnd yet we ventured, for the gain proposed\nChoked the respect of likely peril fear'd;\nAnd since we are o'erset, venture again.\nCome, we will all put forth, body and goods.\nMORTON\n'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,\nI hear for certain, and do speak the truth,\nThe gentle Archbishop of York is up\nWith well-appointed powers: he is a man\nWho with a double surety binds his followers.\nMy lord your son had only but the corpse,\nBut shadows and the shows of men, to fight;\nFor that same word, rebellion, did divide\nThe action of their bodies from their souls;\nAnd they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,\nAs men drink potions, that their weapons only\nSeem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,\nThis word, rebellion, it had froze them up,\nAs fish are in a pond. But now the bishop\nTurns insurrection to religion:\nSupposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,\nHe's followed both with body and with mind;\nAnd doth enlarge his rising with the blood\nOf fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;\nDerives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;\nTells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,\nGasping for life under great Bolingbroke;\nAnd more and less do flock to follow him.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nI knew of this before; but, to speak truth,\nThis present grief had wiped it from my mind.\nGo in with me; and counsel every man\nThe aptest way for safety and revenge:\nGet posts and letters, and make friends with speed:\nNever so few, and never yet more need.\nExeunt",

    "content":"SCENE II. London. A street.\nEnter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler\nFALSTAFF\nSirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?\nPage\nHe said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy\nwater; but, for the party that owed it, he might\nhave more diseases than he knew for.\nFALSTAFF\nMen of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the\nbrain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not\nable to invent anything that tends to laughter, more\nthan I invent or is invented on me: I am not only\nwitty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other\nmen. I do here walk before thee like a sow that\nhath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the\nprince put thee into my service for any other reason\nthan to set me off, why then I have no judgment.\nThou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn\nin my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never\nmanned with an agate till now: but I will inset you\nneither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and\nsend you back again to your master, for a jewel,--\nthe juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is\nnot yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in\nthe palm of my hand than he shall get one on his\ncheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is\na face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis\nnot a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a\nface-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence\nout of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had\nwrit man ever since his father was a bachelor. He\nmay keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,\nI can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about\nthe satin for my short cloak and my slops?\nPage\nHe said, sir, you should procure him better\nassurance than Bardolph: he would not take his\nband and yours; he liked not the security.\nFALSTAFF\nLet him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his\ntongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally\nyea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,\nand then stand upon security! The whoreson\nsmooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and\nbunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is\nthrough with them in honest taking up, then they\nmust stand upon security. I had as lief they would\nput ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with\nsecurity. I looked a' should have sent me two and\ntwenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he\nsends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;\nfor he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness\nof his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he\nsee, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.\nWhere's Bardolph?\nPage\nHe's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.\nFALSTAFF\nI bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in\nSmithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the\nstews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.\nEnter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant\n\nPage\nSir, here comes the nobleman that committed the\nPrince for striking him about Bardolph.\nFALSTAFF\nWait, close; I will not see him.\nLord Chief-Justice What's he that goes there?\nServant\nFalstaff, an't please your lordship.\nLord Chief-Justice He that was in question for the robbery?\nServant\nHe, my lord: but he hath since done good service at\nShrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some\ncharge to the Lord John of Lancaster.\nLord Chief-Justice What, to York? Call him back again.\nServant\nSir John Falstaff!\nFALSTAFF\nBoy, tell him I am deaf.\nPage\nYou must speak louder; my master is deaf.\nLord Chief-Justice I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.\nGo, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.\nServant\nSir John!\nFALSTAFF\nWhat! a young knave, and begging! Is there not\nwars? is there not employment? doth not the king\nlack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?\nThough it be a shame to be on any side but one, it\nis worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,\nwere it worse than the name of rebellion can tell\nhow to make it.\nServant\nYou mistake me, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nWhy, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting\nmy knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied\nin my throat, if I had said so.\nServant\nI pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our\nsoldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,\nyou lie in your throat, if you say I am any other\nthan an honest man.\nFALSTAFF\nI give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that\nwhich grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,\nhang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be\nhanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!\nServant\nSir, my lord would speak with you.\nLord Chief-Justice Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.\nFALSTAFF\nMy good lord! God give your lordship good time of\nday. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard\nsay your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship\ngoes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not\nclean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in\nyou, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must\nhumbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care\nof your health.\nLord Chief-Justice Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to\nShrewsbury.\nFALSTAFF\nAn't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is\nreturned with some discomfort from Wales.\nLord Chief-Justice I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when\nI sent for you.\nFALSTAFF\nAnd I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into\nthis same whoreson apoplexy.\nLord Chief-Justice Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with\nyou.\nFALSTAFF\nThis apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,\nan't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the\nblood, a whoreson tingling.\nLord Chief-Justice What tell you me of it? be it as it is.\nFALSTAFF\nIt hath its original from much grief, from study and\nperturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of\nhis effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.\nLord Chief-Justice I think you are fallen into the disease; for you\nhear not what I say to you.\nFALSTAFF\nVery well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please\nyou, it is the disease of not listening, the malady\nof not marking, that I am troubled withal.\nLord Chief-Justice To punish you by the heels would amend the\nattention of your ears; and I care not if I do\nbecome your physician.\nFALSTAFF\nI am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:\nyour lordship may minister the potion of\nimprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how\nshould I be your patient to follow your\nprescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a\nscruple, or indeed a scruple itself.\nLord Chief-Justice I sent for you, when there were matters against you\nfor your life, to come speak with me.\nFALSTAFF\nAs I was then advised by my learned counsel in the\nlaws of this land-service, I did not come.\nLord Chief-Justice Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.\nFALSTAFF\nHe that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.\nLord Chief-Justice Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.\nFALSTAFF\nI would it were otherwise; I would my means were\ngreater, and my waist slenderer.\nLord Chief-Justice You have misled the youthful prince.\nFALSTAFF\nThe young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow\nwith the great belly, and he my dog.\nLord Chief-Justice Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your\nday's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded\nover your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may\nthank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting\nthat action.\nFALSTAFF\nMy lord?\nLord Chief-Justice But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a\nsleeping wolf.\nFALSTAFF\nTo wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.\nLord Chief-Justice What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt\nout.\nFALSTAFF\nA wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say\nof wax, my growth would approve the truth.\nLord Chief-Justice There is not a white hair on your face but should\nhave his effect of gravity.\nFALSTAFF\nHis effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.\nLord Chief-Justice You follow the young prince up and down, like his\nill angel.\nFALSTAFF\nNot so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope\nhe that looks upon me will take me without weighing:\nand yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I\ncannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these\ncostermonger times that true valour is turned\nbear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath\nhis quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the\nother gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of\nthis age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.\nYou that are old consider not the capacities of us\nthat are young; you do measure the heat of our\nlivers with the bitterness of your galls: and we\nthat are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,\nare wags too.\nLord Chief-Justice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,\nthat are written down old with all the characters of\nage? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a\nyellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an\nincreasing belly? is not your voice broken? your\nwind short? your chin double? your wit single? and\nevery part about you blasted with antiquity? and\nwill you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!\nFALSTAFF\nMy lord, I was born about three of the clock in the\nafternoon, with a white head and something a round\nbelly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing\nand singing of anthems. To approve my youth\nfurther, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in\njudgment and understanding; and he that will caper\nwith me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the\nmoney, and have at him! For the box of the ear that\nthe prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,\nand you took it like a sensible lord. I have\nchequed him for it, and the young lion repents;\nmarry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk\nand old sack.\nLord Chief-Justice Well, God send the prince a better companion!\nFALSTAFF\nGod send the companion a better prince! I cannot\nrid my hands of him.\nLord Chief-Justice Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I\nhear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster\nagainst the Archbishop and the Earl of\nNorthumberland.\nFALSTAFF\nYea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look\nyou pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,\nthat our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the\nLord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean\nnot to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,\nand I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I\nmight never spit white again. There is not a\ndangerous action can peep out his head but I am\nthrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it\nwas alway yet the trick of our English nation, if\nthey have a good thing, to make it too common. If\nye will needs say I am an old man, you should give\nme rest. I would to God my name were not so\nterrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be\neaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to\nnothing with perpetual motion.\nLord Chief-Justice Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your\nexpedition!\nFALSTAFF\nWill your lordship lend me a thousand pound to\nfurnish me forth?\nLord Chief-Justice Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to\nbear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my\ncousin Westmoreland.\nExeunt Chief-Justice and Servant\n\nFALSTAFF\nIf I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man\ncan no more separate age and covetousness than a'\ncan part young limbs and lechery: but the gout\ngalls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and\nso both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!\nPage\nSir?\nFALSTAFF\nWhat money is in my purse?\nPage\nSeven groats and two pence.\nFALSTAFF\nI can get no remedy against this consumption of the\npurse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,\nbut the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter\nto my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this\nto the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old\nMistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry\nsince I perceived the first white hair on my chin.\nAbout it: you know where to find me.\nExit Page\n\nA pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for\nthe one or the other plays the rogue with my great\ntoe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars\nfor my colour, and my pension shall seem the more\nreasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:\nI will turn diseases to commodity.\nExit",

    "content":"SCENE III. York. The Archbishop's palace.\nEnter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nThus have you heard our cause and known our means;\nAnd, my most noble friends, I pray you all,\nSpeak plainly your opinions of our hopes:\nAnd first, lord marshal, what say you to it?\nMOWBRAY\nI well allow the occasion of our arms;\nBut gladly would be better satisfied\nHow in our means we should advance ourselves\nTo look with forehead bold and big enough\nUpon the power and puissance of the king.\nHASTINGS\nOur present musters grow upon the file\nTo five and twenty thousand men of choice;\nAnd our supplies live largely in the hope\nOf great Northumberland, whose bosom burns\nWith an incensed fire of injuries.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nThe question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;\nWhether our present five and twenty thousand\nMay hold up head without Northumberland?\nHASTINGS\nWith him, we may.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nYea, marry, there's the point:\nBut if without him we be thought too feeble,\nMy judgment is, we should not step too far\nTill we had his assistance by the hand;\nFor in a theme so bloody-faced as this\nConjecture, expectation, and surmise\nOf aids incertain should not be admitted.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed\nIt was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nIt was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,\nEating the air on promise of supply,\nFlattering himself in project of a power\nMuch smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:\nAnd so, with great imagination\nProper to madmen, led his powers to death\nAnd winking leap'd into destruction.\nHASTINGS\nBut, by your leave, it never yet did hurt\nTo lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nYes, if this present quality of war,\nIndeed the instant action: a cause on foot\nLives so in hope as in an early spring\nWe see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,\nHope gives not so much warrant as despair\nThat frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,\nWe first survey the plot, then draw the model;\nAnd when we see the figure of the house,\nThen must we rate the cost of the erection;\nWhich if we find outweighs ability,\nWhat do we then but draw anew the model\nIn fewer offices, or at last desist\nTo build at all? Much more, in this great work,\nWhich is almost to pluck a kingdom down\nAnd set another up, should we survey\nThe plot of situation and the model,\nConsent upon a sure foundation,\nQuestion surveyors, know our own estate,\nHow able such a work to undergo,\nTo weigh against his opposite; or else\nWe fortify in paper and in figures,\nUsing the names of men instead of men:\nLike one that draws the model of a house\nBeyond his power to build it; who, half through,\nGives o'er and leaves his part-created cost\nA naked subject to the weeping clouds\nAnd waste for churlish winter's tyranny.\nHASTINGS\nGrant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,\nShould be still-born, and that we now possess'd\nThe utmost man of expectation,\nI think we are a body strong enough,\nEven as we are, to equal with the king.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nWhat, is the king but five and twenty thousand?\nHASTINGS\nTo us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.\nFor his divisions, as the times do brawl,\nAre in three heads: one power against the French,\nAnd one against Glendower; perforce a third\nMust take up us: so is the unfirm king\nIn three divided; and his coffers sound\nWith hollow poverty and emptiness.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nThat he should draw his several strengths together\nAnd come against us in full puissance,\nNeed not be dreaded.\nHASTINGS\nIf he should do so,\nHe leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh\nBaying him at the heels: never fear that.\nLORD BARDOLPH\nWho is it like should lead his forces hither?\nHASTINGS\nThe Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;\nAgainst the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:\nBut who is substituted 'gainst the French,\nI have no certain notice.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nLet us on,\nAnd publish the occasion of our arms.\nThe commonwealth is sick of their own choice;\nTheir over-greedy love hath surfeited:\nAn habitation giddy and unsure\nHath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.\nO thou fond many, with what loud applause\nDidst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,\nBefore he was what thou wouldst have him be!\nAnd being now trimm'd in thine own desires,\nThou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,\nThat thou provokest thyself to cast him up.\nSo, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge\nThy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;\nAnd now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,\nAnd howl'st to find it. What trust is in\nthese times?\nThey that, when Richard lived, would have him die,\nAre now become enamour'd on his grave:\nThou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head\nWhen through proud London he came sighing on\nAfter the admired heels of Bolingbroke,\nCriest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,\nAnd take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!\nPast and to come seems best; things present worst.\nMOWBRAY\nShall we go draw our numbers and set on?\nHASTINGS\nWe are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.\nExeunt"

Doth\nit not show vilely in me to desire small beer?\nPOINS\nWhy, a prince should not be so loosely studied as\nto remember so weak a composition.\nPRINCE HENRY\nBelike then my appetite was not princely got; for,\nby my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,\nsmall beer. But, indeed, these humble\nconsiderations make me out of love with my\ngreatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember\nthy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to\ntake note how many pair of silk stockings thou\nhast, viz. these, and those that were thy\npeach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy\nshirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for\nuse! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better\nthan I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when\nthou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done\na great while, because the rest of thy low\ncountries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:\nand God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins\nof thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the\nmidwives say the children are not in the fault;\nwhereupon the world increases, and kindreds are\nmightily strengthened.\nPOINS\nHow ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,\nyou should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good\nyoung princes would do so, their fathers being so\nsick as yours at this time is?\nPRINCE HENRY\nShall I tell thee one thing, Poins?\nPOINS\nYes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.\nPRINCE HENRY\nIt shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.\nPOINS\nGo to; I stand the push of your one thing that you\nwill tell.\nPRINCE HENRY\nMarry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be\nsad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell\nthee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a\nbetter, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad\nindeed too.\nPOINS\nVery hardly upon such a subject.\nPRINCE HENRY\nBy this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's\nbook as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and\npersistency: let the end try the man. But I tell\nthee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so\nsick: and keeping such vile company as thou art\nhath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.\nPOINS\nThe reason?\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?\nPOINS\nI would think thee a most princely hypocrite.\nPRINCE HENRY\nIt would be every man's thought; and thou art a\nblessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never\na man's thought in the world keeps the road-way\nbetter than thine: every man would think me an\nhypocrite indeed. And what accites your most\nworshipful thought to think so?\nPOINS\nWhy, because you have been so lewd and so much\nengraffed to Falstaff.\nPRINCE HENRY\nAnd to thee.\nPOINS\nBy this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it\nwith my own ears: the worst that they can say of\nme is that I am a second brother and that I am a\nproper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I\nconfess, I cannot help.

Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.\nBARDOLPH\nAn you do not make him hanged among you, the\ngallows shall have wrong.\nPRINCE HENRY\nAnd how doth thy master, Bardolph?\nBARDOLPH\nWell, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to\ntown: there's a letter for you.\nPOINS\nDelivered with good respect. And how doth the\nmartlemas, your master?\nBARDOLPH\nIn bodily health, sir.\nPOINS\nMarry, the immortal part needs a physician; but\nthat moves not him: though that be sick, it dies\nnot.\nPRINCE HENRY\nI do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my\ndog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.\nPOINS\n[Reads] 'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must\nknow that, as oft as he has occasion to name\nhimself: even like those that are kin to the king;\nfor they never prick their finger but they say,\n'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How\ncomes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to\nconceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's\ncap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'\nPRINCE HENRY\nNay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it\nfrom Japhet.

Repent\nat idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.\nThine, by yea and no, which is as much as to\nsay, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my\nfamiliars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,\nand SIR JOHN with all Europe.'\nMy lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.\nPRINCE HENRY\nThat's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do\nyou use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?\nPOINS\nGod send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWell, thus we play the fools with the time, and the\nspirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.\nIs your master here in London?\nBARDOLPH\nYea, my lord.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhere sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?\nBARDOLPH\nAt the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat company?\nPage\nEphesians, my lord, of the old church.\nPRINCE HENRY\nSup any women with him?\nPage\nNone, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and\nMistress Doll Tearsheet.\nPRINCE HENRY\nWhat pagan may that be?\nPage\nA proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.\nPRINCE HENRY\nEven such kin as the parish heifers are to the town\nbull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?\nPOINS\nI am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.\nPRINCE HENRY\nSirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your\nmaster that I am yet come to town: there's for\nyour silence.\nBARDOLPH\nI have no tongue, sir.\nPage\nAnd for mine, sir, I will govern it.\nPRINCE HENRY\nFare you well; go.\nExeunt BARDOLPH and Page\n\nThis Doll Tearsheet should be some road.\nPOINS\nI warrant you, as common as the way between Saint\nAlban's and London.\nPRINCE HENRY\nHow might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night\nin his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?\nPOINS\nPut on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait\nupon him at his table as drawers.\nPRINCE HENRY\nFrom a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was\nJove's case.

How doth the good knight? may I ask how my\nlady his wife doth?\nBARDOLPH\nSir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than\nwith a wife.\nSHALLOW\nIt is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said\nindeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,\nindeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever\nwere, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of\n'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.\nBARDOLPH\nPardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call\nyou it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;\nbut I will maintain the word with my sword to be a\nsoldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good\ncommand, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a\nman is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,\nbeing, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;\nwhich is an excellent thing.\nSHALLOW\nIt is very just.\nEnter FALSTAFF\n\nLook, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good\nhand, give me your worship's good hand: by my\ntroth, you like well and bear your years very well:\nwelcome, good Sir John.\nFALSTAFF\nI am glad to see you well, good Master Robert\nShallow: Master Surecard, as I think?\nSHALLOW\nNo, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.\nFALSTAFF\nGood Master Silence, it well befits you should be of\nthe peace.\nSILENCE\nYour good-worship is welcome.\nFALSTAFF\nFie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you\nprovided me here half a dozen sufficient men?\nSHALLOW\nMarry, have we, sir. Will you sit?\nFALSTAFF\nLet me see them, I beseech you.\nSHALLOW\nWhere's the roll? where's the roll? where's the\nroll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:\nyea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as\nI call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me\nsee; where is Mouldy?\nMOULDY\nHere, an't please you.\nSHALLOW\nWhat think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;\nyoung, strong, and of good friends.\nFALSTAFF\nIs thy name Mouldy?\nMOULDY\nYea, an't please you.\nFALSTAFF\n'Tis the more time thou wert used.\nSHALLOW\nHa, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that\nare mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,\nwell said, Sir John, very well said.\nFALSTAFF\nPrick him.\nMOULDY\nI was pricked well enough before, an you could have\nlet me alone: my old dame will be undone now for\none to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need\nnot to have pricked me; there are other men fitter\nto go out than I.\nFALSTAFF\nGo to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is\ntime you were spent.\nMOULDY\nSpent!\nSHALLOW\nPeace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where\nyou are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:\nSimon Shadow!\nFALSTAFF\nYea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like\nto be a cold soldier.\nSHALLOW\nWhere's Shadow?\nSHADOW\nHere, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nShadow, whose son art thou?\nSHADOW\nMy mother's son, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nThy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's\nshadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of\nthe male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the\nfather's substance!\nSHALLOW\nDo you like him, Sir John?\nFALSTAFF\nShadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have\na number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.\nSHALLOW\nThomas Wart!\nFALSTAFF\nWhere's he?\nWART\nHere, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nIs thy name Wart?\nWART\nYea, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nThou art a very ragged wart.\nSHALLOW\nShall I prick him down, Sir John?\nFALSTAFF\nIt were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon\nhis back and the whole frame stands upon pins:\nprick him no more.\nSHALLOW\nHa, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I\ncommend you well. Francis Feeble!\nFEEBLE\nHere, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nWhat trade art thou, Feeble?\nFEEBLE\nA woman's tailor, sir.\nSHALLOW\nShall I prick him, sir?\nFALSTAFF\nYou may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld\nha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in\nan enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?\nFEEBLE\nI will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.\nFALSTAFF\nWell said, good woman's tailor! well said,\ncourageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the\nwrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the\nwoman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.\nFEEBLE\nI would Wart might have gone, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nI would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst\nmend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him\nto a private soldier that is the leader of so many\nthousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.\nFEEBLE\nIt shall suffice, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nI am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?\nSHALLOW\nPeter Bullcalf o' the green!\nFALSTAFF\nYea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.\nBULLCALF\nHere, sir.\nFALSTAFF\n'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf\ntill he roar again.\nBULLCALF\nO Lord! good my lord captain,--\nFALSTAFF\nWhat, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?\nBULLCALF\nO Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.\nFALSTAFF\nWhat disease hast thou?\nBULLCALF\nA whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught\nwith ringing in the king's affairs upon his\ncoronation-day, sir.\nFALSTAFF\nCome, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt\nhave away thy cold; and I will take such order that\nmy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?\nSHALLOW\nHere is two more called than your number, you must\nhave but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in\nwith me to dinner.\nFALSTAFF\nCome, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry\ndinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.\nSHALLOW\nO, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night\nin the windmill in Saint George's field?\nFALSTAFF\nNo more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.\nSHALLOW\nHa! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?\nFALSTAFF\nShe lives, Master Shallow.\nSHALLOW\nShe never could away with me.\nFALSTAFF\nNever, never; she would always say she could not\nabide Master Shallow.\nSHALLOW\nBy the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She\nwas then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?\nFALSTAFF\nOld, old, Master Shallow.\nSHALLOW\nNay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;\ncertain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old\nNightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.\nSILENCE\nThat's fifty-five year ago.\nSHALLOW\nHa, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that\nthis knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?\nFALSTAFF\nWe have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.\nSHALLOW\nThat we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,\nSir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'\nCome, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:\nJesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.\nExeunt FALSTAFF and Justices\n\nBULLCALF\nGood Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;\nand here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns\nfor you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be\nhanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,\nI do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,\nand, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with\nmy friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own\npart, so much.\nBARDOLPH\nGo to; stand aside.\nMOULDY\nAnd, good master corporal captain, for my old\ndame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do\nany thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,\nand cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.\nBARDOLPH\nGo to; stand aside.\nFEEBLE\nBy my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we\nowe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:\nan't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is\ntoo good to serve's prince; and let it go which way\nit will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.\nBARDOLPH\nWell said; thou'rt a good fellow.\nFEEBLE\nFaith, I'll bear no base mind.\nRe-enter FALSTAFF and the Justices\n\nFALSTAFF\nCome, sir, which men shall I have?\nSHALLOW\nFour of which you please.\nBARDOLPH\nSir, a word with you: I have three pound to free\nMouldy and Bullcalf.\nFALSTAFF\nGo to; well.\nSHALLOW\nCome, Sir John, which four will you have?\nFALSTAFF\nDo you choose for me.\nSHALLOW\nMarry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.\nFALSTAFF\nMouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home\ntill you are past service: and for your part,\nBullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.\nSHALLOW\nSir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are\nyour likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.\nFALSTAFF\nWill you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a\nman? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,\nbulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the\nspirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a\nragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and\ndischarge you with the motion of a pewterer's\nhammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets\non the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced\nfellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no\nmark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim\nlevel at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;\nhow swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run\noff! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the\ngreat ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.\nBARDOLPH\nHold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.\nFALSTAFF\nCome, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go\nto: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a\nlittle, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'\nfaith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a\ntester for thee.\nSHALLOW\nHe is not his craft's master; he doth not do it\nright. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at\nClement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's\nshow,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'\nwould manage you his piece thus; and a' would about\nand about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,\ntah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and\naway again would a' go, and again would a' come: I\nshall ne'er see such a fellow.\nFALSTAFF\nThese fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God\nkeep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words\nwith you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank\nyou: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give\nthe soldiers coats.\nSHALLOW\nSir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your\naffairs! God send us peace! At your return visit\nour house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;\nperadventure I will with ye to the court.\nFALSTAFF\n'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.\nSHALLOW\nGo to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.\nFALSTAFF\nFare you well, gentle gentlemen.\nExeunt Justices\n\nOn, Bardolph; lead the men away.\nExeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, & c\n\nAs I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do\nsee the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how\nsubject we old men are to this vice of lying! This\nsame starved justice hath done nothing but prate to\nme of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he\nhath done about Turnbull Street: and every third\nword a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's\ntribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a\nman made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'\nwas naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked\nradish, with a head fantastically carved upon it\nwith a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his\ndimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'\nwas the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a\nmonkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came\never in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those\ntunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the\ncarmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or\nhis good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger\nbecome a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a\nGaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and\nI'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the\nTilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding\namong the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a\nGaunt he beat his own name; for you might have\nthrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the\ncase of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a\ncourt: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll\nbe acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall\ngo hard but I will make him a philosopher's two\nstones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the\nold pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I\nmay snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.\nExit",

If that rebellion\nCame like itself, in base and abject routs,\nLed on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,\nAnd countenanced by boys and beggary,\nI say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,\nIn his true, native and most proper shape,\nYou, reverend father, and these noble lords\nHad not been here, to dress the ugly form\nOf base and bloody insurrection\nWith your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,\nWhose see is by a civil peace maintained,\nWhose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,\nWhose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,\nWhose white investments figure innocence,\nThe dove and very blessed spirit of peace,\nWherefore do you so ill translate ourself\nOut of the speech of peace that bears such grace,\nInto the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;\nTurning your books to graves, your ink to blood,\nYour pens to lances and your tongue divine\nTo a trumpet and a point of war?\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nWherefore do I this? so the question stands.\nBriefly to this end: we are all diseased,\nAnd with our surfeiting and wanton hours\nHave brought ourselves into a burning fever,\nAnd we must bleed for it; of which disease\nOur late king, Richard, being infected, died.\nBut, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,\nI take not on me here as a physician,\nNor do I as an enemy to peace\nTroop in the throngs of military men;\nBut rather show awhile like fearful war,\nTo diet rank minds sick of happiness\nAnd purge the obstructions which begin to stop\nOur very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.\nI have in equal balance justly weigh'd\nWhat wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,\nAnd find our griefs heavier than our offences.\nWe see which way the stream of time doth run,\nAnd are enforced from our most quiet there\nBy the rough torrent of occasion;\nAnd have the summary of all our griefs,\nWhen time shall serve, to show in articles;\nWhich long ere this we offer'd to the king,\nAnd might by no suit gain our audience:\nWhen we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,\nWe are denied access unto his person\nEven by those men that most have done us wrong.\nThe dangers of the days but newly gone,\nWhose memory is written on the earth\nWith yet appearing blood, and the examples\nOf every minute's instance, present now,\nHath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,\nNot to break peace or any branch of it,\nBut to establish here a peace indeed,\nConcurring both in name and quality.\nWESTMORELAND\nWhen ever yet was your appeal denied?\nWherein have you been galled by the king?\nWhat peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,\nThat you should seal this lawless bloody book\nOf forged rebellion with a seal divine\nAnd consecrate commotion's bitter edge?\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nMy brother general, the commonwealth,\nTo brother born an household cruelty,\nI make my quarrel in particular.\nWESTMORELAND\nThere is no need of any such redress;\nOr if there were, it not belongs to you.\nMOWBRAY\nWhy not to him in part, and to us all\nThat feel the bruises of the days before,\nAnd suffer the condition of these times\nTo lay a heavy and unequal hand\nUpon our honours?\nWESTMORELAND\nO, my good Lord Mowbray,\nConstrue the times to their necessities,\nAnd you shall say indeed, it is the time,\nAnd not the king, that doth you injuries.\nYet for your part, it not appears to me\nEither from the king or in the present time\nThat you should have an inch of any ground\nTo build a grief on: were you not restored\nTo all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,\nYour noble and right well remember'd father's?\nMOWBRAY\nWhat thing, in honour, had my father lost,\nThat need to be revived and breathed in me?\nThe king that loved him, as the state stood then,\nWas force perforce compell'd to banish him:\nAnd then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,\nBeing mounted and both roused in their seats,\nTheir neighing coursers daring of the spur,\nTheir armed staves in charge, their beavers down,\nTheir eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel\nAnd the loud trumpet blowing them together,\nThen, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd\nMy father from the breast of Bolingbroke,\nO when the king did throw his warder down,\nHis own life hung upon the staff he threw;\nThen threw he down himself and all their lives\nThat by indictment and by dint of sword\nHave since miscarried under Bolingbroke.\nWESTMORELAND\nYou speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.\nThe Earl of Hereford was reputed then\nIn England the most valiant gentlemen:\nWho knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?\nBut if your father had been victor there,\nHe ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:\nFor all the country in a general voice\nCried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love\nWere set on Hereford, whom they doted on\nAnd bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.\nBut this is mere digression from my purpose.\nHere come I from our princely general\nTo know your griefs; to tell you from his grace\nThat he will give you audience; and wherein\nIt shall appear that your demands are just,\nYou shall enjoy them, every thing set off\nThat might so much as think you enemies.\nMOWBRAY\nBut he hath forced us to compel this offer;\nAnd it proceeds from policy, not love.\nWESTMORELAND\nMowbray, you overween to take it so;\nThis offer comes from mercy, not from fear:\nFor, lo! within a ken our army lies,\nUpon mine honour, all too confident\nTo give admittance to a thought of fear.\nOur battle is more full of names than yours,\nOur men more perfect in the use of arms,\nOur armour all as strong, our cause the best;\nThen reason will our heart should be as good\nSay you not then our offer is compell'd.\nMOWBRAY\nWell, by my will we shall admit no parley.\nWESTMORELAND\nThat argues but the shame of your offence:\nA rotten case abides no handling.\nHASTINGS\nHath the Prince John a full commission,\nIn very ample virtue of his father,\nTo hear and absolutely to determine\nOf what conditions we shall stand upon?\nWESTMORELAND\nThat is intended in the general's name:\nI muse you make so slight a question.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nThen take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,\nFor this contains our general grievances:\nEach several article herein redress'd,\nAll members of our cause, both here and hence,\nThat are insinew'd to this action,\nAcquitted by a true substantial form\nAnd present execution of our wills\nTo us and to our purposes confined,\nWe come within our awful banks again\nAnd knit our powers to the arm of peace.\nWESTMORELAND\nThis will I show the general. Please you, lords,\nIn sight of both our battles we may meet;\nAnd either end in peace, which God so frame!\nOr to the place of difference call the swords\nWhich must decide it.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nMy lord, we will do so.\nExit WESTMORELAND\n\nMOWBRAY\nThere is a thing within my bosom tells me\nThat no conditions of our peace can stand.\nHASTINGS\nFear you not that: if we can make our peace\nUpon such large terms and so absolute\nAs our conditions shall consist upon,\nOur peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.\nMOWBRAY\nYea, but our valuation shall be such\nThat every slight and false-derived cause,\nYea, every idle, nice and wanton reason\nShall to the king taste of this action;\nThat, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,\nWe shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind\nThat even our corn shall seem as light as chaff\nAnd good from bad find no partition.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nNo, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary\nOf dainty and such picking grievances:\nFor he hath found to end one doubt by death\nRevives two greater in the heirs of life,\nAnd therefore will he wipe his tables clean\nAnd keep no tell-tale to his memory\nThat may repeat and history his loss\nTo new remembrance; for full well he knows\nHe cannot so precisely weed this land\nAs his misdoubts present occasion:\nHis foes are so enrooted with his friends\nThat, plucking to unfix an enemy,\nHe doth unfasten so and shake a friend:\nSo that this land, like an offensive wife\nThat hath enraged him on to offer strokes,\nAs he is striking, holds his infant up\nAnd hangs resolved correction in the arm\nThat was uprear'd to execution.\nHASTINGS\nBesides, the king hath wasted all his rods\nOn late offenders, that he now doth lack\nThe very instruments of chastisement:\nSo that his power, like to a fangless lion,\nMay offer, but not hold.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n'Tis very true:\nAnd therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,\nIf we do now make our atonement well,\nOur peace will, like a broken limb united,\nGrow stronger for the breaking.\nMOWBRAY\nBe it so.\nHere is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.\nRe-enter WESTMORELAND\n\nWESTMORELAND\nThe prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship\nTo meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.\nMOWBRAY\nYour grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nBefore, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.\nExeunt"

With you, lord bishop,\nIt is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken\nHow deep you were within the books of God?\nTo us the speaker in his parliament;\nTo us the imagined voice of God himself;\nThe very opener and intelligencer\nBetween the grace, the sanctities of heaven\nAnd our dull workings. O, who shall believe\nBut you misuse the reverence of your place,\nEmploy the countenance and grace of heaven,\nAs a false favourite doth his prince's name,\nIn deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,\nUnder the counterfeited zeal of God,\nThe subjects of his substitute, my father,\nAnd both against the peace of heaven and him\nHave here up-swarm'd them.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nGood my Lord of Lancaster,\nI am not here against your father's peace;\nBut, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,\nThe time misorder'd doth, in common sense,\nCrowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,\nTo hold our safety up. I sent your grace\nThe parcels and particulars of our grief,\nThe which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,\nWhereon this Hydra son of war is born;\nWhose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep\nWith grant of our most just and right desires,\nAnd true obedience, of this madness cured,\nStoop tamely to the foot of majesty.\nMOWBRAY\nIf not, we ready are to try our fortunes\nTo the last man.\nHASTINGS\nAnd though we here fall down,\nWe have supplies to second our attempt:\nIf they miscarry, theirs shall second them;\nAnd so success of mischief shall be born\nAnd heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up\nWhiles England shall have generation.\nLANCASTER\nYou are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,\nTo sound the bottom of the after-times.\nWESTMORELAND\nPleaseth your grace to answer them directly\nHow far forth you do like their articles.\nLANCASTER\nI like them all, and do allow them well,\nAnd swear here, by the honour of my blood,\nMy father's purposes have been mistook,\nAnd some about him have too lavishly\nWrested his meaning and authority.\nMy lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;\nUpon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,\nDischarge your powers unto their several counties,\nAs we will ours: and here between the armies\nLet's drink together friendly and embrace,\nThat all their eyes may bear those tokens home\nOf our restored love and amity.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nI take your princely word for these redresses.\nLANCASTER\nI give it you, and will maintain my word:\nAnd thereupon I drink unto your grace.\nHASTINGS\nGo, captain, and deliver to the army\nThis news of peace: let them have pay, and part:\nI know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.\nExit Officer\n\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nTo you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.\nWESTMORELAND\nI pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains\nI have bestow'd to breed this present peace,\nYou would drink freely: but my love to ye\nShall show itself more openly hereafter.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nI do not doubt you.\nWESTMORELAND\nI am glad of it.\nHealth to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.\nMOWBRAY\nYou wish me health in very happy season;\nFor I am, on the sudden, something ill.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nAgainst ill chances men are ever merry;\nBut heaviness foreruns the good event.\nWESTMORELAND\nTherefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow\nServes to say thus, 'some good thing comes\nto-morrow.'\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nBelieve me, I am passing light in spirit.\nMOWBRAY\nSo much the worse, if your own rule be true.\nShouts within\n\nLANCASTER\nThe word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!\nMOWBRAY\nThis had been cheerful after victory.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nA peace is of the nature of a conquest;\nFor then both parties nobly are subdued,\nAnd neither party loser.\nLANCASTER\nGo, my lord,\nAnd let our army be discharged too.\nExit WESTMORELAND\n\nAnd, good my lord, so please you, let our trains\nMarch, by us, that we may peruse the men\nWe should have coped withal.\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nGo, good Lord Hastings,\nAnd, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.\nExit HASTINGS\n\nLANCASTER\nI trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.\nRe-enter WESTMORELAND\n\nNow, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?\nWESTMORELAND\nThe leaders, having charge from you to stand,\nWill not go off until they hear you speak.\nLANCASTER\nThey know their duties.\nRe-enter HASTINGS\n\nHASTINGS\nMy lord, our army is dispersed already;\nLike youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses\nEast, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,\nEach hurries toward his home and sporting-place.\nWESTMORELAND\nGood tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which\nI do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:\nAnd you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,\nOf capitol treason I attach you both.\nMOWBRAY\nIs this proceeding just and honourable?\nWESTMORELAND\nIs your assembly so?\nARCHBISHOP OF YORK\nWill you thus break your faith?\nLANCASTER\nI pawn'd thee none:\nI promised you redress of these same grievances\nWhereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,\nI will perform with a most Christian care.\nBut for you, rebels, look to taste the due\nMeet for rebellion and such acts as yours.\nMost shallowly did you these arms commence,\nFondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.\nStrike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:\nGod, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.\nSome guard these traitors to the block of death,\nTreason's true bed and yielder up of breath.\nExeunt"

Do ye\nyield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do\nsweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they\nweep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and\ntrembling, and do observance to my mercy.\nCOLEVILE\nI think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that\nthought yield me.\nFALSTAFF\nI have a whole school of tongues in this belly of\nmine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other\nword but my name. An I had but a belly of any\nindifference, I were simply the most active fellow\nin Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.\nHere comes our general.\nEnter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others\n\nLANCASTER\nThe heat is past; follow no further now:\nCall in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.\nExit WESTMORELAND\n\nNow, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?\nWhen every thing is ended, then you come:\nThese tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,\nOne time or other break some gallows' back.\nFALSTAFF\nI would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I\nnever knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward\nof valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a\nbullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the\nexpedition of thought? I have speeded hither with\nthe very extremest inch of possibility; I have\nfoundered nine score and odd posts: and here,\ntravel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and\nimmaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the\ndale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.\nBut what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I\nmay justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,\n'I came, saw, and overcame.'\nLANCASTER\nIt was more of his courtesy than your deserving.\nFALSTAFF\nI know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and\nI beseech your grace, let it be booked with the\nrest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will\nhave it in a particular ballad else, with mine own\npicture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:\nto the which course if I be enforced, if you do not\nall show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the\nclear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full\nmoon doth the cinders of the element, which show\nlike pins' heads to her, believe not the word of\nthe noble: therefore let me have right, and let\ndesert mount.\nLANCASTER\nThine's too heavy to mount.\nFALSTAFF\nLet it shine, then.\nLANCASTER\nThine's too thick to shine.\nFALSTAFF\nLet it do something, my good lord, that may do me\ngood, and call it what you will.\nLANCASTER\nIs thy name Colevile?\nCOLEVILE\nIt is, my lord.\nLANCASTER\nA famous rebel art thou, Colevile.\nFALSTAFF\nAnd a famous true subject took him.\nCOLEVILE\nI am, my lord, but as my betters are\nThat led me hither: had they been ruled by me,\nYou should have won them dearer than you have.\nFALSTAFF\nI know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like\na kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I\nthank thee for thee.\nRe-enter WESTMORELAND\n\nLANCASTER\nNow, have you left pursuit?\nWESTMORELAND\nRetreat is made and execution stay'd.\nLANCASTER\nSend Colevile with his confederates\nTo York, to present execution:\nBlunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.\nExeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE\n\nAnd now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:\nI hear the king my father is sore sick:\nOur news shall go before us to his majesty,\nWhich, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,\nAnd we with sober speed will follow you.\nFALSTAFF\nMy lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go\nThrough Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,\nStand my good lord, pray, in your good report.\nLANCASTER\nFare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,\nShall better speak of you than you deserve.\nExeunt all but Falstaff\n\nFALSTAFF\nI would you had but the wit: 'twere better than\nyour dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-\nblooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make\nhim laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.\nThere's never none of these demure boys come to any\nproof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,\nand making many fish-meals, that they fall into a\nkind of male green-sickness; and then when they\nmarry, they get wenches: they are generally fools\nand cowards; which some of us should be too, but for\ninflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold\noperation in it. It ascends me into the brain;\ndries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy\nvapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,\nquick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and\ndelectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the\nvoice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes\nexcellent wit. The second property of your\nexcellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;\nwhich, before cold and settled, left the liver\nwhite and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity\nand cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes\nit course from the inwards to the parts extreme:\nit illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives\nwarning to all the rest of this little kingdom,\nman, to arm; and then the vital commoners and\ninland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,\nthe heart, who, great and puffed up with this\nretinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour\ncomes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is\nnothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and\nlearning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till\nsack commences it and sets it in act and use.\nHereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for\nthe cold blood he did naturally inherit of his\nfather, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,\nmanured, husbanded and tilled with excellent\nendeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile\nsherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If\nI had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I\nwould teach them should be, to forswear thin\npotations and to addict themselves to sack.\nEnter BARDOLPH\n\nHow now Bardolph?\nBARDOLPH\nThe army is discharged all and gone.\nFALSTAFF\nLet them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and\nthere will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:\nI have him already tempering between my finger and\nmy thumb, and shortly will I seal with him.

Learn this, Thomas,\nAnd thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,\nA hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,\nThat the united vessel of their blood,\nMingled with venom of suggestion--\nAs, force perforce, the age will pour it in--\nShall never leak, though it do work as strong\nAs aconitum or rash gunpowder.\nCLARENCE\nI shall observe him with all care and love.\nKING HENRY IV\nWhy art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?\nCLARENCE\nHe is not there to-day; he dines in London.\nKING HENRY IV\nAnd how accompanied? canst thou tell that?\nCLARENCE\nWith Poins, and other his continual followers.\nKING HENRY IV\nMost subject is the fattest soil to weeds;\nAnd he, the noble image of my youth,\nIs overspread with them: therefore my grief\nStretches itself beyond the hour of death:\nThe blood weeps from my heart when I do shape\nIn forms imaginary the unguided days\nAnd rotten times that you shall look upon\nWhen I am sleeping with my ancestors.\nFor when his headstrong riot hath no curb,\nWhen rage and hot blood are his counsellors,\nWhen means and lavish manners meet together,\nO, with what wings shall his affections fly\nTowards fronting peril and opposed decay!\nWARWICK\nMy gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:\nThe prince but studies his companions\nLike a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,\n'Tis needful that the most immodest word\nBe look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,\nYour highness knows, comes to no further use\nBut to be known and hated.

There is your crown;\nAnd He that wears the crown immortally\nLong guard it yours! If I affect it more\nThan as your honour and as your renown,\nLet me no more from this obedience rise,\nWhich my most inward true and duteous spirit\nTeacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.\nGod witness with me, when I here came in,\nAnd found no course of breath within your majesty,\nHow cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,\nO, let me in my present wildness die\nAnd never live to show the incredulous world\nThe noble change that I have purposed!\nComing to look on you, thinking you dead,\nAnd dead almost, my liege, to think you were,\nI spake unto this crown as having sense,\nAnd thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending\nHath fed upon the body of my father;\nTherefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:\nOther, less fine in carat, is more precious,\nPreserving life in medicine potable;\nBut thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,\nHast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,\nAccusing it, I put it on my head,\nTo try with it, as with an enemy\nThat had before my face murder'd my father,\nThe quarrel of a true inheritor.\nBut if it did infect my blood with joy,\nOr swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;\nIf any rebel or vain spirit of mine\nDid with the least affection of a welcome\nGive entertainment to the might of it,\nLet God for ever keep it from my head\nAnd make me as the poorest vassal is\nThat doth with awe and terror kneel to it!\nKING HENRY IV\nO my son,\nGod put it in thy mind to take it hence,\nThat thou mightst win the more thy father's love,\nPleading so wisely in excuse of it!\nCome hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;\nAnd hear, I think, the very latest counsel\nThat ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,\nBy what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways\nI met this crown; and I myself know well\nHow troublesome it sat upon my head.\nTo thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,\nBetter opinion, better confirmation;\nFor all the soil of the achievement goes\nWith me into the earth. It seem'd in me\nBut as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,\nAnd I had many living to upbraid\nMy gain of it by their assistances;\nWhich daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,\nWounding supposed peace: all these bold fears\nThou see'st with peril I have answered;\nFor all my reign hath been but as a scene\nActing that argument: and now my death\nChanges the mode; for what in me was purchased,\nFalls upon thee in a more fairer sort;\nSo thou the garland wear'st successively.\nYet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,\nThou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;\nAnd all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,\nHave but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;\nBy whose fell working I was first advanced\nAnd by whose power I well might lodge a fear\nTo be again displaced: which to avoid,\nI cut them off; and had a purpose now\nTo lead out many to the Holy Land,\nLest rest and lying still might make them look\nToo near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,\nBe it thy course to busy giddy minds\nWith foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,\nMay waste the memory of the former days.\nMore would I, but my lungs are wasted so\nThat strength of speech is utterly denied me.\nHow I came by the crown, O God forgive;\nAnd grant it may with thee in true peace live!\nPRINCE HENRY\nMy gracious liege,\nYou won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;\nThen plain and right must my possession be:\nWhich I with more than with a common pain\n'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.\nEnter Lord John of LANCASTER\n\nKING HENRY IV\nLook, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.\nLANCASTER\nHealth, peace, and happiness to my royal father!\nKING HENRY IV\nThou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;\nBut health, alack, with youthful wings is flown\nFrom this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight\nMy worldly business makes a period.\nWhere is my Lord of Warwick?\nPRINCE HENRY\nMy Lord of Warwick!\nEnter WARWICK, and others\n\nKING HENRY IV\nDoth any name particular belong\nUnto the lodging where I first did swoon?\nWARWICK\n'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.\nKING HENRY IV\nLaud be to God! even there my life must end.\nIt hath been prophesied to me many years,\nI should not die but in Jerusalem;\nWhich vainly I supposed the Holy Land:\nBut bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;\nIn that Jerusalem shall Harry die.\nExeunt",

An honest\nman, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave\nis not. I have served your worship truly, sir,\nthis eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in\na quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I\nhave but a very little credit with your worship.

It is a wonderful thing to see the\nsemblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:\nthey, by observing of him, do bear themselves like\nfoolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is\nturned into a justice-like serving-man: their\nspirits are so married in conjunction with the\nparticipation of society that they flock together in\nconsent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit\nto Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the\nimputation of being near their master: if to his\nmen, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man\ncould better command his servants. It is certain\nthat either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is\ncaught, as men take diseases, one of another:\ntherefore let men take heed of their company. I\nwill devise matter enough out of this Shallow to\nkeep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing\nout of six fashions, which is four terms, or two\nactions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,\nit is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest\nwith a sad brow will do with a fellow that never\nhad the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him\nlaugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!\nSHALLOW\n[Within] Sir John!\nFALSTAFF\nI come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.\nExit"

You did commit me:\nFor which, I do commit into your hand\nThe unstained sword that you have used to bear;\nWith this remembrance, that you use the same\nWith the like bold, just and impartial spirit\nAs you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.\nYou shall be as a father to my youth:\nMy voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,\nAnd I will stoop and humble my intents\nTo your well-practised wise directions.\nAnd, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;\nMy father is gone wild into his grave,\nFor in his tomb lie my affections;\nAnd with his spirit sadly I survive,\nTo mock the expectation of the world,\nTo frustrate prophecies and to raze out\nRotten opinion, who hath writ me down\nAfter my seeming. The tide of blood in me\nHath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:\nNow doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,\nWhere it shall mingle with the state of floods\nAnd flow henceforth in formal majesty.\nNow call we our high court of parliament:\nAnd let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,\nThat the great body of our state may go\nIn equal rank with the best govern'd nation;\nThat war, or peace, or both at once, may be\nAs things acquainted and familiar to us;\nIn which you, father, shall have foremost hand.\nOur coronation done, we will accite,\nAs I before remember'd, all our state:\nAnd, God consigning to my good intents,\nNo prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,\nGod shorten Harry's happy life one day!\nExeunt"

    "content":"EPILOGUE\nSpoken by a Dancer\n\nFirst my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.\nMy fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;\nand my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look\nfor a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have\nto say is of mine own making; and what indeed I\nshould say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.\nBut to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it\nknown to you, as it is very well, I was lately here\nin the end of a displeasing play, to pray your\npatience for it and to promise you a better. I\nmeant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an\nill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and\nyou, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you\nI would be and here I commit my body to your\nmercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,\nas most debtors do, promise you infinitely.\nIf my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will\nyou command me to use my legs? and yet that were but\nlight payment, to dance out of your debt. But a\ngood conscience will make any possible satisfaction,\nand so would I. All the gentlewomen here have\nforgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the\ngentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which\nwas never seen before in such an assembly.\nOne word more, I beseech you. If you be not too\nmuch cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will\ncontinue the story, with Sir John in it, and make\nyou merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for\nany thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,\nunless already a' be killed with your hard\nopinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is\nnot the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are\ntoo, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down\nbefore you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen."
