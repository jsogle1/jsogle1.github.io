    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Sicilia. An Antechamber in Leontes’ Palace.\nEnter Camillo and Archidamus.\n\nARCHIDAMUS.\nIf you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.\n\nARCHIDAMUS.\nWherein our entertainment shall shame us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed,—\n\nCAMILLO.\nBeseech you—\n\nARCHIDAMUS.\nVerily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.\n\nCAMILLO.\nYou pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.\n\nARCHIDAMUS.\nBelieve me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.\n\nCAMILLO.\nSicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained together in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue their loves!\n\nARCHIDAMUS.\nI think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.\n\nARCHIDAMUS.\nWould they else be content to die?\n\nCAMILLO.\nYes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.\n\nARCHIDAMUS.\nIf the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. The same. A Room of State in the Palace.\nEnter Leontes, Polixenes, Hermione, Mamillius, Camillo and Attendants.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nNine changes of the watery star hath been\nThe shepherd’s note since we have left our throne\nWithout a burden. Time as long again\nWould be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks;\nAnd yet we should, for perpetuity,\nGo hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,\nYet standing in rich place, I multiply\nWith one “we thank you” many thousands more\nThat go before it.\n\nLEONTES.\nStay your thanks a while,\nAnd pay them when you part.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nSir, that’s tomorrow.\nI am question’d by my fears, of what may chance\nOr breed upon our absence; that may blow\nNo sneaping winds at home, to make us say\n“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d\nTo tire your royalty.\n\nLEONTES.\nWe are tougher, brother,\nThan you can put us to ’t.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nNo longer stay.\n\nLEONTES.\nOne seve’night longer.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nVery sooth, tomorrow.\n\nLEONTES.\nWe’ll part the time between ’s then: and in that\nI’ll no gainsaying.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nPress me not, beseech you, so,\nThere is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,\nSo soon as yours, could win me: so it should now,\nWere there necessity in your request, although\n’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs\nDo even drag me homeward: which to hinder\nWere, in your love a whip to me; my stay\nTo you a charge and trouble: to save both,\nFarewell, our brother.\n\nLEONTES.\nTongue-tied, our queen? Speak you.\n\nHERMIONE.\nI had thought, sir, to have held my peace until\nYou had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,\nCharge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure\nAll in Bohemia’s well: this satisfaction\nThe by-gone day proclaimed. Say this to him,\nHe’s beat from his best ward.\n\nLEONTES.\nWell said, Hermione.\n\nHERMIONE.\nTo tell he longs to see his son were strong.\nBut let him say so then, and let him go;\nBut let him swear so, and he shall not stay,\nWe’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.\n[To Polixenes.] Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure\nThe borrow of a week. When at Bohemia\nYou take my lord, I’ll give him my commission\nTo let him there a month behind the gest\nPrefix’d for’s parting:—yet, good deed, Leontes,\nI love thee not a jar of th’ clock behind\nWhat lady she her lord. You’ll stay?\n\nPOLIXENES.\nNo, madam.\n\nHERMIONE.\nNay, but you will?\n\nPOLIXENES.\nI may not, verily.\n\nHERMIONE.\nVerily!\nYou put me off with limber vows; but I,\nThough you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,\nShould yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily,\nYou shall not go. A lady’s verily is\nAs potent as a lord’s. Will go yet?\nForce me to keep you as a prisoner,\nNot like a guest: so you shall pay your fees\nWhen you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?\nMy prisoner or my guest? By your dread “verily,”\nOne of them you shall be.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nYour guest, then, madam.\nTo be your prisoner should import offending;\nWhich is for me less easy to commit\nThan you to punish.\n\nHERMIONE.\nNot your gaoler then,\nBut your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you\nOf my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.\nYou were pretty lordings then.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nWe were, fair queen,\nTwo lads that thought there was no more behind\nBut such a day tomorrow as today,\nAnd to be boy eternal.\n\nHERMIONE.\nWas not my lord\nThe verier wag o’ th’ two?\n\nPOLIXENES.\nWe were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun\nAnd bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d\nWas innocence for innocence; we knew not\nThe doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d\nThat any did. Had we pursu’d that life,\nAnd our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d\nWith stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven\nBoldly “Not guilty,” the imposition clear’d\nHereditary ours.\n\nHERMIONE.\nBy this we gather\nYou have tripp’d since.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nO my most sacred lady,\nTemptations have since then been born to ’s! for\nIn those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl;\nYour precious self had then not cross’d the eyes\nOf my young play-fellow.\n\nHERMIONE.\nGrace to boot!\nOf this make no conclusion, lest you say\nYour queen and I are devils. Yet go on;\nTh’ offences we have made you do we’ll answer,\nIf you first sinn’d with us, and that with us\nYou did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not\nWith any but with us.\n\nLEONTES.\nIs he won yet?\n\nHERMIONE.\nHe’ll stay, my lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nAt my request he would not.\nHermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st\nTo better purpose.\n\nHERMIONE.\nNever?\n\nLEONTES.\nNever but once.\n\nHERMIONE.\nWhat! have I twice said well? when was’t before?\nI prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s\nAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless\nSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\nOur praises are our wages. You may ride ’s\nWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\nWith spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:\nMy last good deed was to entreat his stay.\nWhat was my first? It has an elder sister,\nOr I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\nBut once before I spoke to the purpose—when?\nNay, let me have’t; I long.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhy, that was when\nThree crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,\nEre I could make thee open thy white hand\nAnd clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter\n“I am yours for ever.”\n\nHERMIONE.\n’Tis Grace indeed.\nWhy, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.\nThe one for ever earn’d a royal husband;\nTh’ other for some while a friend.\n\n[Giving her hand to Polixenes.]\n\nLEONTES.\n[Aside.] Too hot, too hot!\nTo mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.\nI have tremor cordis on me. My heart dances,\nBut not for joy,—not joy. This entertainment\nMay a free face put on, derive a liberty\nFrom heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,\nAnd well become the agent: ’t may, I grant:\nBut to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,\nAs now they are, and making practis’d smiles\nAs in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as ’twere\nThe mort o’ th’ deer. O, that is entertainment\nMy bosom likes not, nor my brows. Mamillius,\nArt thou my boy?\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nI’ fecks!\nWhy, that’s my bawcock. What! hast smutch’d thy nose?\nThey say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\nWe must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:\nAnd yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf\nAre all call’d neat.—Still virginalling\nUpon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf!\nArt thou my calf?\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nYes, if you will, my lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nThou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have\nTo be full like me:—yet they say we are\nAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,\nThat will say anything. But were they false\nAs o’er-dy’d blacks, as wind, as waters, false\nAs dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes\nNo bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true\nTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\nLook on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\nMost dear’st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may’t be?\nAffection! thy intention stabs the centre:\nThou dost make possible things not so held,\nCommunicat’st with dreams;—how can this be?—\nWith what’s unreal thou coactive art,\nAnd fellow’st nothing: then ’tis very credent\nThou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,\nAnd that beyond commission, and I find it,\nAnd that to the infection of my brains\nAnd hardening of my brows.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nWhat means Sicilia?\n\nHERMIONE.\nHe something seems unsettled.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nHow, my lord?\nWhat cheer? How is’t with you, best brother?\n\nHERMIONE.\nYou look\nAs if you held a brow of much distraction:\nAre you mov’d, my lord?\n\nLEONTES.\nNo, in good earnest.\nHow sometimes nature will betray its folly,\nIts tenderness, and make itself a pastime\nTo harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\nOf my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil\nTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d,\nIn my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzled\nLest it should bite its master, and so prove,\nAs ornaments oft do, too dangerous.\nHow like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\nThis squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\nWill you take eggs for money?\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nNo, my lord, I’ll fight.\n\nLEONTES.\nYou will? Why, happy man be ’s dole! My brother,\nAre you so fond of your young prince as we\nDo seem to be of ours?\n\nPOLIXENES.\nIf at home, sir,\nHe’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter:\nNow my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;\nMy parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.\nHe makes a July’s day short as December;\nAnd with his varying childness cures in me\nThoughts that would thick my blood.\n\nLEONTES.\nSo stands this squire\nOffic’d with me. We two will walk, my lord,\nAnd leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\nHow thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome;\nLet what is dear in Sicily be cheap:\nNext to thyself and my young rover, he’s\nApparent to my heart.\n\nHERMIONE.\nIf you would seek us,\nWe are yours i’ the garden. Shall ’s attend you there?\n\nLEONTES.\nTo your own bents dispose you: you’ll be found,\nBe you beneath the sky. [Aside.] I am angling now,\nThough you perceive me not how I give line.\nGo to, go to!\nHow she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\nAnd arms her with the boldness of a wife\nTo her allowing husband!\n\n[Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione and Attendants.]\n\nGone already!\nInch-thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a fork’d one!—\nGo, play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I\nPlay too; but so disgrac’d a part, whose issue\nWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour\nWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There have been,\nOr I am much deceiv’d, cuckolds ere now;\nAnd many a man there is, even at this present,\nNow while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm,\nThat little thinks she has been sluic’d in ’s absence,\nAnd his pond fish’d by his next neighbour, by\nSir Smile, his neighbour. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t,\nWhiles other men have gates, and those gates open’d,\nAs mine, against their will. Should all despair\nThat hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\nWould hang themselves. Physic for’t there’s none;\nIt is a bawdy planet, that will strike\nWhere ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it,\nFrom east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,\nNo barricado for a belly. Know’t;\nIt will let in and out the enemy\nWith bag and baggage. Many thousand of us\nHave the disease, and feel’t not.—How now, boy!\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nI am like you, they say.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhy, that’s some comfort.\nWhat! Camillo there?\n\nCAMILLO.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nGo play, Mamillius; thou’rt an honest man.\n\n[Exit Mamillius.]\n\nCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\n\nCAMILLO.\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\n\nLEONTES.\nDidst note it?\n\nCAMILLO.\nHe would not stay at your petitions; made\nHis business more material.\n\nLEONTES.\nDidst perceive it?\n[Aside.] They’re here with me already; whisp’ring, rounding,\n“Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone\nWhen I shall gust it last.—How came’t, Camillo,\nThat he did stay?\n\nCAMILLO.\nAt the good queen’s entreaty.\n\nLEONTES.\nAt the queen’s be’t: “good” should be pertinent,\nBut so it is, it is not. Was this taken\nBy any understanding pate but thine?\nFor thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\nMore than the common blocks. Not noted, is’t,\nBut of the finer natures? by some severals\nOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\nPerchance are to this business purblind? say.\n\nCAMILLO.\nBusiness, my lord? I think most understand\nBohemia stays here longer.\n\nLEONTES.\nHa?\n\nCAMILLO.\nStays here longer.\n\nLEONTES.\nAy, but why?\n\nCAMILLO.\nTo satisfy your highness, and the entreaties\nOf our most gracious mistress.\n\nLEONTES.\nSatisfy?\nTh’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?\nLet that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\nWith all the nearest things to my heart, as well\nMy chamber-counsels, wherein, priest-like, thou\nHast cleans’d my bosom; I from thee departed\nThy penitent reform’d. But we have been\nDeceiv’d in thy integrity, deceiv’d\nIn that which seems so.\n\nCAMILLO.\nBe it forbid, my lord!\n\nLEONTES.\nTo bide upon’t: thou art not honest; or,\nIf thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,\nWhich hoxes honesty behind, restraining\nFrom course requir’d; or else thou must be counted\nA servant grafted in my serious trust,\nAnd therein negligent; or else a fool\nThat seest a game play’d home, the rich stake drawn,\nAnd tak’st it all for jest.\n\nCAMILLO.\nMy gracious lord,\nI may be negligent, foolish, and fearful;\nIn every one of these no man is free,\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\nIt was my folly; if industriously\nI play’d the fool, it was my negligence,\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\nWhereof the execution did cry out\nAgainst the non-performance, ’twas a fear\nWhich oft affects the wisest: these, my lord,\nAre such allow’d infirmities that honesty\nIs never free of. But, beseech your Grace,\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\n’Tis none of mine.\n\nLEONTES.\nHa’ not you seen, Camillo?\n(But that’s past doubt: you have, or your eye-glass\nIs thicker than a cuckold’s horn) or heard?\n(For, to a vision so apparent, rumour\nCannot be mute) or thought? (for cogitation\nResides not in that man that does not think)\nMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\nOr else be impudently negative,\nTo have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\nMy wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name\nAs rank as any flax-wench that puts to\nBefore her troth-plight: say’t and justify’t.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\nMy present vengeance taken: ’shrew my heart,\nYou never spoke what did become you less\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\nAs deep as that, though true.\n\nLEONTES.\nIs whispering nothing?\nIs leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\nKissing with inside lip? Stopping the career\nOf laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible\nOf breaking honesty?—horsing foot on foot?\nSkulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?\nHours, minutes? Noon, midnight? and all eyes\nBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\nThat would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?\nWhy, then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing,\nThe covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,\nMy wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,\nIf this be nothing.\n\nCAMILLO.\nGood my lord, be cur’d\nOf this diseas’d opinion, and betimes,\nFor ’tis most dangerous.\n\nLEONTES.\nSay it be, ’tis true.\n\nCAMILLO.\nNo, no, my lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nIt is; you lie, you lie:\nI say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\nPronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\nOr else a hovering temporizer that\nCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\nInclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver\nInfected as her life, she would not live\nThe running of one glass.\n\nCAMILLO.\nWho does infect her?\n\nLEONTES.\nWhy, he that wears her like her medal, hanging\nAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\nHad servants true about me, that bare eyes\nTo see alike mine honour as their profits,\nTheir own particular thrifts, they would do that\nWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\nHis cupbearer,—whom I from meaner form\nHave bench’d and rear’d to worship, who mayst see\nPlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\nHow I am galled,—mightst bespice a cup,\nTo give mine enemy a lasting wink;\nWhich draught to me were cordial.\n\nCAMILLO.\nSir, my lord,\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\nBut with a ling’ring dram, that should not work\nMaliciously like poison. But I cannot\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\nI have lov’d thee,—\n\nLEONTES.\nMake that thy question, and go rot!\nDost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\nTo appoint myself in this vexation; sully\nThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,\n(Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\nIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps)\nGive scandal to the blood o’ th’ prince, my son,\n(Who I do think is mine, and love as mine)\nWithout ripe moving to’t? Would I do this?\nCould man so blench?\n\nCAMILLO.\nI must believe you, sir:\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for’t;\nProvided that, when he’s remov’d, your highness\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\nEven for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\nKnown and allied to yours.\n\nLEONTES.\nThou dost advise me\nEven so as I mine own course have set down:\nI’ll give no blemish to her honour, none.\n\nCAMILLO.\nMy lord,\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer.\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\nAccount me not your servant.\n\nLEONTES.\nThis is all:\nDo’t, and thou hast the one half of my heart;\nDo’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI’ll do’t, my lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nI will seem friendly, as thou hast advis’d me.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCAMILLO.\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\nOf good Polixenes, and my ground to do’t\nIs the obedience to a master; one\nWho, in rebellion with himself, will have\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\nAnd flourish’d after, I’d not do’t. But since\nNor brass, nor stone, nor parchment, bears not one,\nLet villainy itself forswear’t. I must\nForsake the court: to do’t, or no, is certain\nTo me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!\nHere comes Bohemia.\n\nEnter Polixenes.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nThis is strange. Methinks\nMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\nGood day, Camillo.\n\nCAMILLO.\nHail, most royal sir!\n\nPOLIXENES.\nWhat is the news i’ th’ court?\n\nCAMILLO.\nNone rare, my lord.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nThe king hath on him such a countenance\nAs he had lost some province, and a region\nLov’d as he loves himself. Even now I met him\nWith customary compliment, when he,\nWafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling\nA lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and\nSo leaves me to consider what is breeding\nThat changes thus his manners.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI dare not know, my lord.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nHow, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?\nBe intelligent to me? ’Tis thereabouts;\nFor, to yourself, what you do know, you must,\nAnd cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,\nYour chang’d complexions are to me a mirror\nWhich shows me mine chang’d too; for I must be\nA party in this alteration, finding\nMyself thus alter’d with’t.\n\nCAMILLO.\nThere is a sickness\nWhich puts some of us in distemper, but\nI cannot name the disease, and it is caught\nOf you that yet are well.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nHow caught of me?\nMake me not sighted like the basilisk.\nI have look’d on thousands who have sped the better\nBy my regard, but kill’d none so. Camillo,—\nAs you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\nClerk-like, experienc’d, which no less adorns\nOur gentry than our parents’ noble names,\nIn whose success we are gentle,—I beseech you,\nIf you know aught which does behove my knowledge\nThereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not\nIn ignorant concealment.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI may not answer.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nA sickness caught of me, and yet I well?\nI must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\nI conjure thee, by all the parts of man\nWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\nIs not this suit of mine, that thou declare\nWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm\nIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\nWhich way to be prevented, if to be;\nIf not, how best to bear it.\n\nCAMILLO.\nSir, I will tell you;\nSince I am charg’d in honour, and by him\nThat I think honourable. Therefore mark my counsel,\nWhich must be ev’n as swiftly follow’d as\nI mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\nCry lost, and so goodnight!\n\nPOLIXENES.\nOn, good Camillo.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI am appointed him to murder you.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nBy whom, Camillo?\n\nCAMILLO.\nBy the king.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nFor what?\n\nCAMILLO.\nHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\nAs he had seen’t or been an instrument\nTo vice you to’t, that you have touch’d his queen\nForbiddenly.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nO, then my best blood turn\nTo an infected jelly, and my name\nBe yok’d with his that did betray the Best!\nTurn then my freshest reputation to\nA savour that may strike the dullest nostril\nWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,\nNay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection\nThat e’er was heard or read!\n\nCAMILLO.\nSwear his thought over\nBy each particular star in heaven and\nBy all their influences, you may as well\nForbid the sea for to obey the moon\nAs or by oath remove or counsel shake\nThe fabric of his folly, whose foundation\nIs pil’d upon his faith, and will continue\nThe standing of his body.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nHow should this grow?\n\nCAMILLO.\nI know not: but I am sure ’tis safer to\nAvoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.\nIf therefore you dare trust my honesty,\nThat lies enclosed in this trunk, which you\nShall bear along impawn’d, away tonight.\nYour followers I will whisper to the business,\nAnd will by twos and threes, at several posterns,\nClear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put\nMy fortunes to your service, which are here\nBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,\nFor, by the honour of my parents, I\nHave utter’d truth: which if you seek to prove,\nI dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\nThan one condemned by the king’s own mouth,\nThereon his execution sworn.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nI do believe thee.\nI saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand,\nBe pilot to me, and thy places shall\nStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready, and\nMy people did expect my hence departure\nTwo days ago. This jealousy\nIs for a precious creature: as she’s rare,\nMust it be great; and, as his person’s mighty,\nMust it be violent; and as he does conceive\nHe is dishonour’d by a man which ever\nProfess’d to him, why, his revenges must\nIn that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.\nGood expedition be my friend, and comfort\nThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\nOf his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo,\nI will respect thee as a father if\nThou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.\n\nCAMILLO.\nIt is in mine authority to command\nThe keys of all the posterns: please your highness\nTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT II\nSCENE I. Sicilia. A Room in the Palace.\nEnter Hermione, Mamillius and Ladies.\n\nHERMIONE.\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\n’Tis past enduring.\n\nFIRST LADY.\nCome, my gracious lord,\nShall I be your playfellow?\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nNo, I’ll none of you.\n\nFIRST LADY.\nWhy, my sweet lord?\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nYou’ll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if\nI were a baby still. I love you better.\n\nSECOND LADY.\nAnd why so, my lord?\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nNot for because\nYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\nBecome some women best, so that there be not\nToo much hair there, but in a semicircle\nOr a half-moon made with a pen.\n\nSECOND LADY.\nWho taught this?\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nI learn’d it out of women’s faces. Pray now,\nWhat colour are your eyebrows?\n\nFIRST LADY.\nBlue, my lord.\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nNay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose\nThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\n\nFIRST LADY.\nHark ye,\nThe queen your mother rounds apace. We shall\nPresent our services to a fine new prince\nOne of these days, and then you’d wanton with us,\nIf we would have you.\n\nSECOND LADY.\nShe is spread of late\nInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\n\nHERMIONE.\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\nI am for you again. Pray you sit by us,\nAnd tell ’s a tale.\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nMerry or sad shall’t be?\n\nHERMIONE.\nAs merry as you will.\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nA sad tale’s best for winter. I have one\nOf sprites and goblins.\n\nHERMIONE.\nLet’s have that, good sir.\nCome on, sit down. Come on, and do your best\nTo fright me with your sprites: you’re powerful at it.\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nThere was a man,—\n\nHERMIONE.\nNay, come, sit down, then on.\n\nMAMILLIUS.\nDwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,\nYond crickets shall not hear it.\n\nHERMIONE.\nCome on then,\nAnd give’t me in mine ear.\n\nEnter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords and Guards.\n\nLEONTES.\nWas he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBehind the tuft of pines I met them, never\nSaw I men scour so on their way: I ey’d them\nEven to their ships.\n\nLEONTES.\nHow blest am I\nIn my just censure, in my true opinion!\nAlack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs’d\nIn being so blest! There may be in the cup\nA spider steep’d, and one may drink, depart,\nAnd yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\nIs not infected; but if one present\nTh’ abhorr’d ingredient to his eye, make known\nHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\nWith violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.\nCamillo was his help in this, his pander.\nThere is a plot against my life, my crown;\nAll’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain\nWhom I employ’d, was pre-employ’d by him.\nHe has discover’d my design, and I\nRemain a pinch’d thing; yea, a very trick\nFor them to play at will. How came the posterns\nSo easily open?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBy his great authority,\nWhich often hath no less prevail’d than so\nOn your command.\n\nLEONTES.\nI know’t too well.\nGive me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse him.\nThough he does bear some signs of me, yet you\nHave too much blood in him.\n\nHERMIONE.\nWhat is this? sport?\n\nLEONTES.\nBear the boy hence, he shall not come about her,\nAway with him, and let her sport herself\nWith that she’s big with; for ’tis Polixenes\nHas made thee swell thus.\n\n[Exit Mamillius with some of the Guards.]\n\nHERMIONE.\nBut I’d say he had not,\nAnd I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,\nHowe’er you learn th’ nayward.\n\nLEONTES.\nYou, my lords,\nLook on her, mark her well. Be but about\nTo say, “she is a goodly lady,” and\nThe justice of your hearts will thereto add\n“’Tis pity she’s not honest, honourable”:\nPraise her but for this her without-door form,\nWhich on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\nThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\nThat calumny doth use—O, I am out,\nThat mercy does; for calumny will sear\nVirtue itself—these shrugs, these hum’s, and ha’s,\nWhen you have said “she’s goodly,” come between,\nEre you can say “she’s honest”: but be it known,\nFrom him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\nShe’s an adultress!\n\nHERMIONE.\nShould a villain say so,\nThe most replenish’d villain in the world,\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\nDo but mistake.\n\nLEONTES.\nYou have mistook, my lady,\nPolixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,\nWhich I’ll not call a creature of thy place,\nLest barbarism, making me the precedent,\nShould a like language use to all degrees,\nAnd mannerly distinguishment leave out\nBetwixt the prince and beggar. I have said\nShe’s an adultress; I have said with whom:\nMore, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is\nA federary with her; and one that knows\nWhat she should shame to know herself\nBut with her most vile principal, that she’s\nA bed-swerver, even as bad as those\nThat vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy\nTo this their late escape.\n\nHERMIONE.\nNo, by my life,\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\nYou thus have publish’d me! Gentle my lord,\nYou scarce can right me throughly then, to say\nYou did mistake.\n\nLEONTES.\nNo. If I mistake\nIn those foundations which I build upon,\nThe centre is not big enough to bear\nA school-boy’s top. Away with her to prison!\nHe who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\nBut that he speaks.\n\nHERMIONE.\nThere’s some ill planet reigns:\nI must be patient till the heavens look\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\nPerchance shall dry your pities. But I have\nThat honourable grief lodg’d here which burns\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\nThe king’s will be perform’d.\n\nLEONTES.\nShall I be heard?\n\nHERMIONE.\nWho is’t that goes with me? Beseech your highness\nMy women may be with me, for you see\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\nHas deserv’d prison, then abound in tears\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\nI never wish’d to see you sorry; now\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\n\nLEONTES.\nGo, do our bidding. Hence!\n\n[Exeunt Queen and Ladies with Guards.]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBeseech your highness, call the queen again.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nBe certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\nProve violence, in the which three great ones suffer,\nYourself, your queen, your son.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nFor her, my lord,\nI dare my life lay down, and will do’t, sir,\nPlease you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\nI’ th’ eyes of heaven and to you—I mean\nIn this which you accuse her.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nIf it prove\nShe’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where\nI lodge my wife; I’ll go in couples with her;\nThan when I feel and see her no further trust her.\nFor every inch of woman in the world,\nAy, every dram of woman’s flesh, is false,\nIf she be.\n\nLEONTES.\nHold your peaces.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGood my lord,—\n\nANTIGONUS.\nIt is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\nYou are abus’d, and by some putter-on\nThat will be damn’d for’t: would I knew the villain,\nI would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw’d,\nI have three daughters; the eldest is eleven;\nThe second and the third, nine and some five;\nIf this prove true, they’ll pay for’t. By mine honour,\nI’ll geld ’em all; fourteen they shall not see,\nTo bring false generations: they are co-heirs,\nAnd I had rather glib myself than they\nShould not produce fair issue.\n\nLEONTES.\nCease; no more.\nYou smell this business with a sense as cold\nAs is a dead man’s nose: but I do see’t and feel’t,\nAs you feel doing thus; and see withal\nThe instruments that feel.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nIf it be so,\nWe need no grave to bury honesty.\nThere’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten\nOf the whole dungy earth.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhat! Lack I credit?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\nUpon this ground: and more it would content me\nTo have her honour true than your suspicion,\nBe blam’d for’t how you might.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhy, what need we\nCommune with you of this, but rather follow\nOur forceful instigation? Our prerogative\nCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\nImparts this; which, if you, or stupified\nOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\nRelish a truth, like us, inform yourselves\nWe need no more of your advice: the matter,\nThe loss, the gain, the ord’ring on’t, is all\nProperly ours.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nAnd I wish, my liege,\nYou had only in your silent judgement tried it,\nWithout more overture.\n\nLEONTES.\nHow could that be?\nEither thou art most ignorant by age,\nOr thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,\nAdded to their familiarity,\n(Which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture,\nThat lack’d sight only, nought for approbation\nBut only seeing, all other circumstances\nMade up to th’ deed) doth push on this proceeding.\nYet, for a greater confirmation\n(For in an act of this importance, ’twere\nMost piteous to be wild), I have dispatch’d in post\nTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,\nCleomenes and Dion, whom you know\nOf stuff’d sufficiency: now from the oracle\nThey will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,\nShall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nWell done, my lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nThough I am satisfied, and need no more\nThan what I know, yet shall the oracle\nGive rest to the minds of others, such as he\nWhose ignorant credulity will not\nCome up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good\nFrom our free person she should be confin’d,\nLest that the treachery of the two fled hence\nBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;\nWe are to speak in public; for this business\nWill raise us all.\n\nANTIGONUS.\n[Aside.] To laughter, as I take it,\nIf the good truth were known.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A Room in the Palace.\nEnter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords and other Attendants.\n\nLEONTES.\nNor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\nTo bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If\nThe cause were not in being,—part o’ th’ cause,\nShe th’ adultress; for the harlot king\nIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\nAnd level of my brain, plot-proof. But she\nI can hook to me. Say that she were gone,\nGiven to the fire, a moiety of my rest\nMight come to me again. Who’s there?\n\nFIRST ATTENDANT.\nMy lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nHow does the boy?\n\nFIRST ATTENDANT.\nHe took good rest tonight;\n’Tis hop’d his sickness is discharg’d.\n\nLEONTES.\nTo see his nobleness,\nConceiving the dishonour of his mother.\nHe straight declin’d, droop’d, took it deeply,\nFasten’d and fix’d the shame on’t in himself,\nThrew off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\nAnd downright languish’d. Leave me solely: go,\nSee how he fares.\n\n[Exit First Attendant.]\n\nFie, fie! no thought of him.\nThe very thought of my revenges that way\nRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\nAnd in his parties, his alliance. Let him be,\nUntil a time may serve. For present vengeance,\nTake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\nLaugh at me; make their pastime at my sorrow:\nThey should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\nShall she, within my power.\n\nEnter Paulina carrying a baby, with Antigonus, lords and servants.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nYou must not enter.\n\nPAULINA.\nNay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\nFear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\nThan the queen’s life? a gracious innocent soul,\nMore free than he is jealous.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nThat’s enough.\n\nSERVANT.\nMadam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\nNone should come at him.\n\nPAULINA.\nNot so hot, good sir;\nI come to bring him sleep. ’Tis such as you,\nThat creep like shadows by him, and do sigh\nAt each his needless heavings,—such as you\nNourish the cause of his awaking. I\nDo come with words as med’cinal as true,\nHonest as either, to purge him of that humour\nThat presses him from sleep.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhat noise there, ho?\n\nPAULINA.\nNo noise, my lord; but needful conference\nAbout some gossips for your highness.\n\nLEONTES.\nHow!\nAway with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\nI charg’d thee that she should not come about me.\nI knew she would.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nI told her so, my lord,\nOn your displeasure’s peril and on mine,\nShe should not visit you.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhat, canst not rule her?\n\nPAULINA.\nFrom all dishonesty he can. In this,\nUnless he take the course that you have done,\nCommit me for committing honour—trust it,\nHe shall not rule me.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nLa you now, you hear.\nWhen she will take the rein I let her run;\nBut she’ll not stumble.\n\nPAULINA.\nGood my liege, I come,—\nAnd, I beseech you hear me, who professes\nMyself your loyal servant, your physician,\nYour most obedient counsellor, yet that dares\nLess appear so, in comforting your evils,\nThan such as most seem yours—I say I come\nFrom your good queen.\n\nLEONTES.\nGood queen!\n\nPAULINA.\nGood queen, my lord, good queen: I say, good queen,\nAnd would by combat make her good, so were I\nA man, the worst about you.\n\nLEONTES.\nForce her hence.\n\nPAULINA.\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I’ll off;\nBut first I’ll do my errand. The good queen,\n(For she is good) hath brought you forth a daughter;\nHere ’tis; commends it to your blessing.\n\n[Laying down the child.]\n\nLEONTES.\nOut!\nA mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door:\nA most intelligencing bawd!\n\nPAULINA.\nNot so.\nI am as ignorant in that as you\nIn so entitling me; and no less honest\nThan you are mad; which is enough, I’ll warrant,\nAs this world goes, to pass for honest.\n\nLEONTES.\nTraitors!\nWill you not push her out? [To Antigonus.] Give her the bastard,\nThou dotard! Thou art woman-tir’d, unroosted\nBy thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,\nTake’t up, I say; give’t to thy crone.\n\nPAULINA.\nFor ever\nUnvenerable be thy hands, if thou\nTak’st up the princess by that forced baseness\nWhich he has put upon ’t!\n\nLEONTES.\nHe dreads his wife.\n\nPAULINA.\nSo I would you did; then ’twere past all doubt\nYou’d call your children yours.\n\nLEONTES.\nA nest of traitors!\n\nANTIGONUS.\nI am none, by this good light.\n\nPAULINA.\nNor I; nor any\nBut one that’s here, and that’s himself. For he\nThe sacred honour of himself, his queen’s,\nHis hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,\nWhose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will not,\n(For, as the case now stands, it is a curse\nHe cannot be compell’d to’t) once remove\nThe root of his opinion, which is rotten\nAs ever oak or stone was sound.\n\nLEONTES.\nA callat\nOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband,\nAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\nIt is the issue of Polixenes.\nHence with it, and together with the dam\nCommit them to the fire.\n\nPAULINA.\nIt is yours;\nAnd, might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge,\nSo like you ’tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\nAlthough the print be little, the whole matter\nAnd copy of the father: eye, nose, lip,\nThe trick of ’s frown, his forehead; nay, the valley,\nThe pretty dimples of his chin and cheek; his smiles;\nThe very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\nAnd thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\nSo like to him that got it, if thou hast\nThe ordering of the mind too, ’mongst all colours\nNo yellow in ’t, lest she suspect, as he does,\nHer children not her husband’s!\n\nLEONTES.\nA gross hag!\nAnd, losel, thou art worthy to be hang’d\nThat wilt not stay her tongue.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nHang all the husbands\nThat cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself\nHardly one subject.\n\nLEONTES.\nOnce more, take her hence.\n\nPAULINA.\nA most unworthy and unnatural lord\nCan do no more.\n\nLEONTES.\nI’ll have thee burnt.\n\nPAULINA.\nI care not.\nIt is an heretic that makes the fire,\nNot she which burns in ’t. I’ll not call you tyrant;\nBut this most cruel usage of your queen,\nNot able to produce more accusation\nThan your own weak-hing’d fancy, something savours\nOf tyranny, and will ignoble make you,\nYea, scandalous to the world.\n\nLEONTES.\nOn your allegiance,\nOut of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\nWhere were her life? She durst not call me so,\nIf she did know me one. Away with her!\n\nPAULINA.\nI pray you, do not push me; I’ll be gone.\nLook to your babe, my lord; ’tis yours: Jove send her\nA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\nYou that are thus so tender o’er his follies,\nWill never do him good, not one of you.\nSo, so. Farewell; we are gone.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nLEONTES.\nThou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\nMy child? Away with’t. Even thou, that hast\nA heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,\nAnd see it instantly consum’d with fire;\nEven thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight:\nWithin this hour bring me word ’tis done,\nAnd by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life,\nWith that thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse\nAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\nThe bastard brains with these my proper hands\nShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\nFor thou set’st on thy wife.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nI did not, sir:\nThese lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\nCan clear me in ’t.\n\nLORDS\nWe can: my royal liege,\nHe is not guilty of her coming hither.\n\nLEONTES.\nYou’re liars all.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBeseech your highness, give us better credit:\nWe have always truly serv’d you; and beseech\nSo to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,\nAs recompense of our dear services\nPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,\nWhich being so horrible, so bloody, must\nLead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.\n\nLEONTES.\nI am a feather for each wind that blows.\nShall I live on to see this bastard kneel\nAnd call me father? better burn it now\nThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.\nIt shall not neither. [To Antigonus.] You, sir, come you hither,\nYou that have been so tenderly officious\nWith Lady Margery, your midwife, there,\nTo save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,\nSo sure as this beard’s grey. What will you adventure\nTo save this brat’s life?\n\nANTIGONUS.\nAnything, my lord,\nThat my ability may undergo,\nAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:\nI’ll pawn the little blood which I have left\nTo save the innocent. Anything possible.\n\nLEONTES.\nIt shall be possible. Swear by this sword\nThou wilt perform my bidding.\n\nANTIGONUS.\nI will, my lord.\n\nLEONTES.\nMark, and perform it, seest thou? for the fail\nOf any point in’t shall not only be\nDeath to thyself, but to thy lewd-tongu’d wife,\nWhom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\nAs thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry\nThis female bastard hence, and that thou bear it\nTo some remote and desert place, quite out\nOf our dominions; and that there thou leave it,\nWithout more mercy, to it own protection\nAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\nIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\nOn thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,\nThat thou commend it strangely to some place\nWhere chance may nurse or end it.

A Court of Justice.\nEnter Leontes, Lords and Officers appear, properly seated.\n\nLEONTES.\nThis sessions (to our great grief we pronounce)\nEven pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried\nThe daughter of a king, our wife, and one\nOf us too much belov’d. Let us be clear’d\nOf being tyrannous, since we so openly\nProceed in justice, which shall have due course,\nEven to the guilt or the purgation.\nProduce the prisoner.\n\nOFFICER.\nIt is his highness’ pleasure that the queen\nAppear in person here in court. Silence!\n\nHermione is brought in guarded; Paulina and Ladies attending.\n\nLEONTES.\nRead the indictment.\n\nOFFICER.\n[Reads.] “Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes, king of Bohemia; and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by night.”\n\nHERMIONE.\nSince what I am to say must be but that\nWhich contradicts my accusation, and\nThe testimony on my part no other\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\nTo say “Not guilty”. Mine integrity,\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\nBe so receiv’d. But thus, if powers divine\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\nI doubt not, then, but innocence shall make\nFalse accusation blush, and tyranny\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\nThan history can pattern, though devis’d\nAnd play’d to take spectators. For behold me,\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\nA moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\nTo prate and talk for life and honour ’fore\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honour,\n’Tis a derivative from me to mine,\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\nHave strain’d t’ appear thus: if one jot beyond\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\nThat way inclining, harden’d be the hearts\nOf all that hear me, and my near’st of kin\nCry fie upon my grave!\n\nLEONTES.\nI ne’er heard yet\nThat any of these bolder vices wanted\nLess impudence to gainsay what they did\nThan to perform it first.\n\nHERMIONE.\nThat’s true enough;\nThough ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\n\nLEONTES.\nYou will not own it.\n\nHERMIONE.\nMore than mistress of\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\nWith whom I am accus’d, I do confess\nI lov’d him as in honour he requir’d,\nWith such a kind of love as might become\nA lady like me; with a love even such,\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\nWhich not to have done, I think had been in me\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\nEver since it could speak, from an infant, freely,\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\nI know not how it tastes, though it be dish’d\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\n\nLEONTES.\nYou knew of his departure, as you know\nWhat you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.\n\nHERMIONE.\nSir,\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\nWhich I’ll lay down.\n\nLEONTES.\nYour actions are my dreams.\nYou had a bastard by Polixenes,\nAnd I but dream’d it. As you were past all shame\n(Those of your fact are so) so past all truth,\nWhich to deny concerns more than avails; for as\nThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\nNo father owning it (which is, indeed,\nMore criminal in thee than it), so thou\nShalt feel our justice; in whose easiest passage\nLook for no less than death.\n\nHERMIONE.\nSir, spare your threats:\nThe bug which you would fright me with, I seek.\nTo me can life be no commodity.\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\nI do give lost, for I do feel it gone,\nBut know not how it went. My second joy,\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\nI am barr’d, like one infectious. My third comfort,\nStarr’d most unluckily, is from my breast,\n(The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth)\nHal’d out to murder; myself on every post\nProclaim’d a strumpet; with immodest hatred\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which ’longs\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\nHere to this place, i’ th’ open air, before\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\nThat I should fear to die. Therefore proceed.\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not: no life,\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn’d\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\n’Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,\nI do refer me to the oracle:\nApollo be my judge!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThis your request\nIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,\nAnd in Apollo’s name, his oracle:\n\n[Exeunt certain Officers.]\n\nHERMIONE.\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father.\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\nHis daughter’s trial! that he did but see\nThe flatness of my misery; yet with eyes\nOf pity, not revenge!\n\nEnter Officers with Cleomenes and Dion.\n\nOFFICER.\nYou here shall swear upon this sword of justice,\nThat you, Cleomenes and Dion, have\nBeen both at Delphos, and from thence have brought\nThis seal’d-up oracle, by the hand deliver’d\nOf great Apollo’s priest; and that since then\nYou have not dared to break the holy seal,\nNor read the secrets in’t.\n\nCLEOMENES, DION.\nAll this we swear.\n\nLEONTES.\nBreak up the seals and read.\n\nOFFICER.\n[Reads.] “Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten; and the king shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not found.”\n\nLORDS\nNow blessed be the great Apollo!\n\nHERMIONE.\nPraised!\n\nLEONTES.\nHast thou read truth?\n\nOFFICER.\nAy, my lord, even so\nAs it is here set down.\n\nLEONTES.\nThere is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle:\nThe sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.\n\nEnter a Servant hastily.\n\nSERVANT.\nMy lord the king, the king!\n\nLEONTES.\nWhat is the business?\n\nSERVANT.\nO sir, I shall be hated to report it.\nThe prince your son, with mere conceit and fear\nOf the queen’s speed, is gone.\n\nLEONTES.\nHow! gone?\n\nSERVANT.\nIs dead.\n\nLEONTES.\nApollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves\nDo strike at my injustice.\n\n[Hermione faints.]\n\nHow now there?\n\nPAULINA.\nThis news is mortal to the queen. Look down\nAnd see what death is doing.\n\nLEONTES.\nTake her hence:\nHer heart is but o’ercharg’d; she will recover.\nI have too much believ’d mine own suspicion.\nBeseech you tenderly apply to her\nSome remedies for life.\n\n[Exeunt Paulina and Ladies with Hermione.]\n\nApollo, pardon\nMy great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle!\nI’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,\nNew woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,\nWhom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;\nFor, being transported by my jealousies\nTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose\nCamillo for the minister to poison\nMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,\nBut that the good mind of Camillo tardied\nMy swift command, though I with death and with\nReward did threaten and encourage him,\nNot doing it and being done. He, most humane\nAnd fill’d with honour, to my kingly guest\nUnclasp’d my practice, quit his fortunes here,\nWhich you knew great, and to the certain hazard\nOf all incertainties himself commended,\nNo richer than his honour. How he glisters\nThorough my rust! And how his piety\nDoes my deeds make the blacker!\n\nEnter Paulina.\n\nPAULINA.\nWoe the while!\nO, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\nBreak too!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nWhat fit is this, good lady?\n\nPAULINA.\nWhat studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\nWhat wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling\nIn leads or oils? What old or newer torture\nMust I receive, whose every word deserves\nTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,\nTogether working with thy jealousies,\nFancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\nFor girls of nine. O, think what they have done,\nAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\nThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\nThat thou betray’dst Polixenes, ’twas nothing;\nThat did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\nAnd damnable ingrateful; nor was’t much\nThou wouldst have poison’d good Camillo’s honour,\nTo have him kill a king; poor trespasses,\nMore monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\nThe casting forth to crows thy baby daughter,\nTo be or none or little, though a devil\nWould have shed water out of fire ere done’t,\nNor is’t directly laid to thee the death\nOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\nThoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\nThat could conceive a gross and foolish sire\nBlemish’d his gracious dam: this is not, no,\nLaid to thy answer: but the last—O lords,\nWhen I have said, cry Woe!—the queen, the queen,\nThe sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance for’t\nNot dropp’d down yet.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThe higher powers forbid!\n\nPAULINA.\nI say she’s dead: I’ll swear’t. If word nor oath\nPrevail not, go and see: if you can bring\nTincture, or lustre, in her lip, her eye,\nHeat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you\nAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\nDo not repent these things, for they are heavier\nThan all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee\nTo nothing but despair. A thousand knees\nTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,\nUpon a barren mountain, and still winter\nIn storm perpetual, could not move the gods\nTo look that way thou wert.\n\nLEONTES.\nGo on, go on:\nThou canst not speak too much; I have deserv’d\nAll tongues to talk their bitterest.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSay no more:\nHowe’er the business goes, you have made fault\nI’ th’ boldness of your speech.\n\nPAULINA.\nI am sorry for ’t:\nAll faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\nI do repent. Alas, I have show’d too much\nThe rashness of a woman: he is touch’d\nTo th’ noble heart. What’s gone and what’s past help,\nShould be past grief. Do not receive affliction\nAt my petition; I beseech you, rather\nLet me be punish’d, that have minded you\nOf what you should forget. Now, good my liege,\nSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:\nThe love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!\nI’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.\nI’ll not remember you of my own lord,\nWho is lost too. Take your patience to you,\nAnd I’ll say nothing.\n\nLEONTES.\nThou didst speak but well\nWhen most the truth, which I receive much better\nThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me\nTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:\nOne grave shall be for both. Upon them shall\nThe causes of their death appear, unto\nOur shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit\nThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\nShall be my recreation. So long as nature\nWill bear up with this exercise, so long\nI daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me\nTo these sorrows.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

The fury spent, anon\nDid this break from her: “Good Antigonus,\nSince fate, against thy better disposition,\nHath made thy person for the thrower-out\nOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,\nPlaces remote enough are in Bohemia,\nThere weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe\nIs counted lost for ever, Perdita\nI prithee call’t. For this ungentle business,\nPut on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see\nThy wife Paulina more.” And so, with shrieks,\nShe melted into air. Affrighted much,\nI did in time collect myself and thought\nThis was so, and no slumber. Dreams are toys,\nYet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\nI will be squar’d by this. I do believe\nHermione hath suffer’d death, and that\nApollo would, this being indeed the issue\nOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\nEither for life or death, upon the earth\nOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well! There lie; and there thy character: there these;\n\n[Laying down the child and a bundle.]\n\nWhich may if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\nAnd still rest thine. The storm begins: poor wretch,\nThat for thy mother’s fault art thus expos’d\nTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\nBut my heart bleeds, and most accurs’d am I\nTo be by oath enjoin’d to this. Farewell!\nThe day frowns more and more. Thou’rt like to have\nA lullaby too rough. I never saw\nThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\nWell may I get aboard!

Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master: if anywhere I have them, ’tis by the sea-side, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an ’t be thy will, what have we here?\n\n[Taking up the child.]\n\nMercy on ’s, a bairn! A very pretty bairn! A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty one; a very pretty one. Sure, some scape. Though I am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape. This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work.

But that’s not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em. Now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallowed with yest and froth, as you’d thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone, how he cried to me for help, and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragon’d it: but first, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nName of mercy, when was this, boy?\n\nCLOWN.\nNow, now. I have not winked since I saw these sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman. He’s at it now.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nWould I had been by to have helped the old man!\n\nCLOWN.\nI would you had been by the ship side, to have helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nHeavy matters, heavy matters! But look thee here, boy. Now bless thyself: thou met’st with things dying, I with things new-born. Here’s a sight for thee. Look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire’s child! Look thee here; take up, take up, boy; open’t. So, let’s see. It was told me I should be rich by the fairies. This is some changeling: open’t. What’s within, boy?\n\nCLOWN.\nYou’re a made old man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you, you’re well to live. Gold! all gold!\n\nSHEPHERD.\nThis is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so. Up with it, keep it close: home, home, the next way. We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good boy, the next way home.\n\nCLOWN.\nGo you the next way with your findings. I’ll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman, and how much he hath eaten. They are never curst but when they are hungry: if there be any of him left, I’ll bury it.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nThat’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to th’ sight of him.\n\nCLOWN.\nMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i’ th’ ground.\n\nSHEPHERD.\n’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good deeds on ’t.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done, which if I have not enough considered (as too much I cannot) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my profit therein the heaping friendships.

What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown, but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nI have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nThat’s likewise part of my intelligence: but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither.

    "content":"SCENE III. The same. A Road near the Shepherd’s cottage.\nEnter Autolycus, singing.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nWhen daffodils begin to peer,\n    With, hey! the doxy over the dale,\nWhy, then comes in the sweet o’ the year,\n    For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale.\n\nThe white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\n    With, hey! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\nDoth set my pugging tooth on edge;\n    For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\n\nThe lark, that tirra-lirra chants,\n    With, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay,\nAre summer songs for me and my aunts,\n    While we lie tumbling in the hay.\n\nI have served Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile, but now I am out of service.\n\nBut shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\n    The pale moon shines by night:\nAnd when I wander here and there,\n    I then do most go right.\n\nIf tinkers may have leave to live,\n    And bear the sow-skin budget,\nThen my account I well may give\n    And in the stocks avouch it.\n\nMy traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who being, I as am, littered under Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway. Beating and hanging are terrors to me. For the life to come, I sleep out the thought of it. A prize! a prize!\n\nEnter Clown.\n\nCLOWN.\nLet me see: every ’leven wether tods; every tod yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\n[Aside.] If the springe hold, the cock’s mine.\n\nCLOWN.\nI cannot do’t without counters. Let me see; what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? “Three pound of sugar, five pound of currants, rice”—what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers, three-man song-men all, and very good ones; but they are most of them means and basses, but one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden pies; “mace; dates”, none, that’s out of my note; “nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger”, but that I may beg; “four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o’ th’ sun.”\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\n[Grovelling on the ground.] O that ever I was born!\n\nCLOWN.\nI’ th’ name of me!\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nO, help me, help me! Pluck but off these rags; and then, death, death!\n\nCLOWN.\nAlack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee, rather than have these off.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nO sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received, which are mighty ones and millions.\n\nCLOWN.\nAlas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great matter.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel ta’en from me, and these detestable things put upon me.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat, by a horseman or a footman?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nA footman, sweet sir, a footman.\n\nCLOWN.\nIndeed, he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee: if this be a horseman’s coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand, I’ll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.\n\n[Helping him up.]\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nO, good sir, tenderly, O!\n\nCLOWN.\nAlas, poor soul!\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nO, good sir, softly, good sir. I fear, sir, my shoulder blade is out.\n\nCLOWN.\nHow now! canst stand?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nSoftly, dear sir! [Picks his pocket.] good sir, softly. You ha’ done me a charitable office.\n\nCLOWN.\nDost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nNo, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have a kinsman not past three-quarters of a mile hence, unto whom I was going. I shall there have money or anything I want. Offer me no money, I pray you; that kills my heart.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat manner of fellow was he that robbed you?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nA fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames. I knew him once a servant of the prince; I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.\n\nCLOWN.\nHis vices, you would say; there’s no virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to make it stay there; and yet it will no more but abide.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nVices, I would say, sir. I know this man well. He hath been since an ape-bearer, then a process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.\n\nCLOWN.\nOut upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs, and bear-baitings.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nVery true, sir; he, sir, he; that’s the rogue that put me into this apparel.\n\nCLOWN.\nNot a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him, he’d have run.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I am false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant him.\n\nCLOWN.\nHow do you now?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nSweet sir, much better than I was. I can stand and walk: I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman’s.\n\nCLOWN.\nShall I bring thee on the way?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nNo, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.\n\nCLOWN.\nThen fare thee well. I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nProsper you, sweet sir!\n\n[Exit Clown.]\n\nYour purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. I’ll be with you at your sheep-shearing too. If I make not this cheat bring out another, and the shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled, and my name put in the book of virtue!\n[Sings.]\nJog on, jog on, the footpath way,\n    And merrily hent the stile-a:\nA merry heart goes all the day,\n    Your sad tires in a mile-a.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE IV. The same. A Shepherd’s Cottage.\nEnter Florizel and Perdita.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nThese your unusual weeds to each part of you\nDo give a life, no shepherdess, but Flora\nPeering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing\nIs as a meeting of the petty gods,\nAnd you the queen on ’t.\n\nPERDITA.\nSir, my gracious lord,\nTo chide at your extremes it not becomes me;\nO, pardon that I name them! Your high self,\nThe gracious mark o’ th’ land, you have obscur’d\nWith a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\nMost goddess-like prank’d up. But that our feasts\nIn every mess have folly, and the feeders\nDigest it with a custom, I should blush\nTo see you so attir’d; swoon, I think,\nTo show myself a glass.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nI bless the time\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\nThy father’s ground.\n\nPERDITA.\nNow Jove afford you cause!\nTo me the difference forges dread. Your greatness\nHath not been us’d to fear. Even now I tremble\nTo think your father, by some accident,\nShould pass this way, as you did. O, the Fates!\nHow would he look to see his work, so noble,\nVilely bound up? What would he say? Or how\nShould I, in these my borrow’d flaunts, behold\nThe sternness of his presence?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nApprehend\nNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\nHumbling their deities to love, have taken\nThe shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter\nBecame a bull and bellow’d; the green Neptune\nA ram and bleated; and the fire-rob’d god,\nGolden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\nAs I seem now. Their transformations\nWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,\nNor in a way so chaste, since my desires\nRun not before mine honour, nor my lusts\nBurn hotter than my faith.\n\nPERDITA.\nO, but, sir,\nYour resolution cannot hold when ’tis\nOppos’d, as it must be, by the power of the king:\nOne of these two must be necessities,\nWhich then will speak, that you must change this purpose,\nOr I my life.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nThou dearest Perdita,\nWith these forc’d thoughts, I prithee, darken not\nThe mirth o’ th’ feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,\nOr not my father’s. For I cannot be\nMine own, nor anything to any, if\nI be not thine. To this I am most constant,\nThough destiny say no. Be merry, gentle.\nStrangle such thoughts as these with anything\nThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\nLift up your countenance, as it were the day\nOf celebration of that nuptial which\nWe two have sworn shall come.\n\nPERDITA.\nO lady Fortune,\nStand you auspicious!\n\nFLORIZEL.\nSee, your guests approach:\nAddress yourself to entertain them sprightly,\nAnd let’s be red with mirth.\n\nEnter Shepherd with Polixenes and Camillo, disguised; Clown, Mopsa, Dorcas with others.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nFie, daughter! When my old wife liv’d, upon\nThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,\nBoth dame and servant; welcom’d all; serv’d all;\nWould sing her song and dance her turn; now here\nAt upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle;\nOn his shoulder, and his; her face o’ fire\nWith labour, and the thing she took to quench it\nShe would to each one sip. You are retired,\nAs if you were a feasted one, and not\nThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid\nThese unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is\nA way to make us better friends, more known.\nCome, quench your blushes, and present yourself\nThat which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on,\nAnd bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,\nAs your good flock shall prosper.\n\nPERDITA.\n[To Polixenes.] Sir, welcome.\nIt is my father’s will I should take on me\nThe hostess-ship o’ the day.\n[To Camillo.] You’re welcome, sir.\nGive me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,\nFor you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep\nSeeming and savour all the winter long.\nGrace and remembrance be to you both!\nAnd welcome to our shearing!\n\nPOLIXENES.\nShepherdess—\nA fair one are you—well you fit our ages\nWith flowers of winter.\n\nPERDITA.\nSir, the year growing ancient,\nNot yet on summer’s death nor on the birth\nOf trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season\nAre our carnations and streak’d gillyvors,\nWhich some call nature’s bastards: of that kind\nOur rustic garden’s barren; and I care not\nTo get slips of them.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nWherefore, gentle maiden,\nDo you neglect them?\n\nPERDITA.\nFor I have heard it said\nThere is an art which, in their piedness, shares\nWith great creating nature.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nSay there be;\nYet nature is made better by no mean\nBut nature makes that mean. So, over that art\nWhich you say adds to nature, is an art\nThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\nA gentler scion to the wildest stock,\nAnd make conceive a bark of baser kind\nBy bud of nobler race. This is an art\nWhich does mend nature, change it rather, but\nThe art itself is nature.\n\nPERDITA.\nSo it is.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nThen make your garden rich in gillyvors,\nAnd do not call them bastards.\n\nPERDITA.\nI’ll not put\nThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;\nNo more than, were I painted, I would wish\nThis youth should say ’twere well, and only therefore\nDesire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:\nHot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,\nThe marigold, that goes to bed with th’ sun\nAnd with him rises weeping. These are flowers\nOf middle summer, and I think they are given\nTo men of middle age. You’re very welcome.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\nAnd only live by gazing.\n\nPERDITA.\nOut, alas!\nYou’d be so lean that blasts of January\nWould blow you through and through. [To Florizel] Now, my fair’st friend,\nI would I had some flowers o’ th’ spring, that might\nBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,\nThat wear upon your virgin branches yet\nYour maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,\nFrom the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall\nFrom Dis’s waggon! daffodils,\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\nThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes\nOr Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,\nThat die unmarried ere they can behold\nBright Phoebus in his strength (a malady\nMost incident to maids); bold oxlips and\nThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\nThe flower-de-luce being one. O, these I lack,\nTo make you garlands of; and my sweet friend,\nTo strew him o’er and o’er!\n\nFLORIZEL.\nWhat, like a corse?\n\nPERDITA.\nNo, like a bank for love to lie and play on;\nNot like a corse; or if, not to be buried,\nBut quick, and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers.\nMethinks I play as I have seen them do\nIn Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine\nDoes change my disposition.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nWhat you do\nStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,\nI’d have you do it ever. When you sing,\nI’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\nPray so; and, for the ord’ring your affairs,\nTo sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you\nA wave o’ th’ sea, that you might ever do\nNothing but that, move still, still so,\nAnd own no other function. Each your doing,\nSo singular in each particular,\nCrowns what you are doing in the present deeds,\nThat all your acts are queens.\n\nPERDITA.\nO Doricles,\nYour praises are too large. But that your youth,\nAnd the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t,\nDo plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,\nWith wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,\nYou woo’d me the false way.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nI think you have\nAs little skill to fear as I have purpose\nTo put you to ’t. But, come; our dance, I pray.\nYour hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair\nThat never mean to part.\n\nPERDITA.\nI’ll swear for ’em.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nThis is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\nRan on the green-sward. Nothing she does or seems\nBut smacks of something greater than herself,\nToo noble for this place.\n\nCAMILLO.\nHe tells her something\nThat makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is\nThe queen of curds and cream.\n\nCLOWN.\nCome on, strike up.\n\nDORCAS.\nMopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, to mend her kissing with!\n\nMOPSA.\nNow, in good time!\n\nCLOWN.\nNot a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.\nCome, strike up.\n\n[Music. Here a dance Of Shepherds and Shepherdesses.]\n\nPOLIXENES.\nPray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this\nWhich dances with your daughter?\n\nSHEPHERD.\nThey call him Doricles; and boasts himself\nTo have a worthy feeding. But I have it\nUpon his own report, and I believe it.\nHe looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.\nI think so too; for never gaz’d the moon\nUpon the water as he’ll stand and read,\nAs ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain,\nI think there is not half a kiss to choose\nWho loves another best.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nShe dances featly.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nSo she does anything, though I report it\nThat should be silent. If young Doricles\nDo light upon her, she shall bring him that\nWhich he not dreams of.\n\nEnter a Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nO master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He utters them as he had eaten ballads, and all men’s ears grew to his tunes.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe could never come better: he shall come in. I love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.\n\nSERVANT.\nHe hath songs for man or woman of all sizes. No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He has the prettiest love-songs for maids, so without bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings, “jump her and thump her”; and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer “Whoop, do me no harm, good man”; puts him off, slights him, with “Whoop, do me no harm, good man.”\n\nPOLIXENES.\nThis is a brave fellow.\n\nCLOWN.\nBelieve me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?\n\nSERVANT.\nHe hath ribbons of all the colours i’ th’ rainbow; points, more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to him by th’ gross; inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns; why he sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on ’t.\n\nCLOWN.\nPrithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.\n\nPERDITA.\nForewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in ’s tunes.\n\n[Exit Servant.]\n\nCLOWN.\nYou have of these pedlars that have more in them than you’d think, sister.\n\nPERDITA.\nAy, good brother, or go about to think.\n\nEnter Autolycus, singing.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nLawn as white as driven snow,\nCypress black as e’er was crow,\nGloves as sweet as damask roses,\nMasks for faces and for noses,\nBugle-bracelet, necklace amber,\nPerfume for a lady’s chamber,\nGolden quoifs and stomachers\nFor my lads to give their dears,\nPins and poking-sticks of steel,\nWhat maids lack from head to heel.\nCome buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;\nBuy, lads, or else your lasses cry.\nCome, buy.\n\nCLOWN.\nIf I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.\n\nMOPSA.\nI was promised them against the feast; but they come not too late now.\n\nDORCAS.\nHe hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.\n\nMOPSA.\nHe hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe he has paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.\n\nCLOWN.\nIs there no manners left among maids? Will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle of these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests? ’Tis well they are whispering. Clamour your tongues, and not a word more.\n\nMOPSA.\nI have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves.\n\nCLOWN.\nHave I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nAnd indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it behoves men to be wary.\n\nCLOWN.\nFear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose nothing here.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat hast here? Ballads?\n\nMOPSA.\nPray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print alife, for then we are sure they are true.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nHere’s one to a very doleful tune. How a usurer’s wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burden, and how she longed to eat adders’ heads and toads carbonadoed.\n\nMOPSA.\nIs it true, think you?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nVery true, and but a month old.\n\nDORCAS.\nBless me from marrying a usurer!\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nHere’s the midwife’s name to’t, one Mistress Taleporter, and five or six honest wives that were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?\n\nMOPSA.\nPray you now, buy it.\n\nCLOWN.\nCome on, lay it by; and let’s first see more ballads. We’ll buy the other things anon.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nHere’s another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It was thought she was a woman, and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful, and as true.\n\nDORCAS.\nIs it true too, think you?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nFive justices’ hands at it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold.\n\nCLOWN.\nLay it by too: another.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nThis is a merry ballad; but a very pretty one.\n\nMOPSA.\nLet’s have some merry ones.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nWhy, this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “Two maids wooing a man.” There’s scarce a maid westward but she sings it. ’Tis in request, I can tell you.\n\nMOPSA.\nWe can both sing it: if thou’lt bear a part, thou shalt hear; ’tis in three parts.\n\nDORCAS.\nWe had the tune on ’t a month ago.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI can bear my part; you must know ’tis my occupation: have at it with you.\n\nSONG.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nGet you hence, for I must go\nWhere it fits not you to know.\n\nDORCAS.\nWhither?\n\nMOPSA.\nO, whither?\n\nDORCAS.\nWhither?\n\nMOPSA.\nIt becomes thy oath full well\nThou to me thy secrets tell.\n\nDORCAS.\nMe too! Let me go thither.\n\nMOPSA.\nOr thou goest to th’ grange or mill.\n\nDORCAS.\nIf to either, thou dost ill.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nNeither.\n\nDORCAS.\nWhat, neither?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nNeither.\n\nDORCAS.\nThou hast sworn my love to be.\n\nMOPSA.\nThou hast sworn it more to me.\nThen whither goest? Say, whither?\n\nCLOWN.\nWe’ll have this song out anon by ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after me. Wenches, I’ll buy for you both. Pedlar, let’s have the first choice. Follow me, girls.\n\n[Exit with Dorcas and Mopsa.]\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\n[Aside.] And you shall pay well for ’em.\n\nSONG.\n\n    Will you buy any tape,\n    Or lace for your cape,\nMy dainty duck, my dear-a?\n    Any silk, any thread,\n    Any toys for your head,\nOf the new’st and fin’st, fin’st wear-a?\n    Come to the pedlar;\n    Money’s a meddler\nThat doth utter all men’s ware-a.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nMaster, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of hair. They call themselves saltiers, and they have dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are not in ’t; but they themselves are o’ the mind (if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling) it will please plentifully.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nAway! we’ll none on ’t. Here has been too much homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nYou weary those that refresh us: pray, let’s see these four threes of herdsmen.\n\nSERVANT.\nOne three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced before the king; and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th’ square.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nLeave your prating: since these good men are pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.\n\nSERVANT.\nWhy, they stay at door, sir.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Twelve Rustics, habited like Satyrs. They dance, and then exeunt.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nO, father, you’ll know more of that hereafter.\n[To Camillo.] Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to part them.\nHe’s simple and tells much. [To Florizel.] How now, fair shepherd!\nYour heart is full of something that does take\nYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young\nAnd handed love, as you do, I was wont\nTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack’d\nThe pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it\nTo her acceptance. You have let him go,\nAnd nothing marted with him. If your lass\nInterpretation should abuse, and call this\nYour lack of love or bounty, you were straited\nFor a reply, at least if you make a care\nOf happy holding her.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nOld sir, I know\nShe prizes not such trifles as these are:\nThe gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d\nUp in my heart, which I have given already,\nBut not deliver’d. O, hear me breathe my life\nBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,\nHath sometime lov’d. I take thy hand! this hand,\nAs soft as dove’s down and as white as it,\nOr Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fann’d snow that’s bolted\nBy th’ northern blasts twice o’er.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nWhat follows this?\nHow prettily the young swain seems to wash\nThe hand was fair before! I have put you out.\nBut to your protestation. Let me hear\nWhat you profess.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nDo, and be witness to ’t.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nAnd this my neighbour, too?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nAnd he, and more\nThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\nThat were I crown’d the most imperial monarch,\nThereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\nThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\nMore than was ever man’s, I would not prize them\nWithout her love; for her employ them all;\nCommend them and condemn them to her service,\nOr to their own perdition.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nFairly offer’d.\n\nCAMILLO.\nThis shows a sound affection.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nBut my daughter,\nSay you the like to him?\n\nPERDITA.\nI cannot speak\nSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\nBy th’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\nThe purity of his.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nTake hands, a bargain!\nAnd, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to’t.\nI give my daughter to him, and will make\nHer portion equal his.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nO, that must be\nI’ th’ virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\nI shall have more than you can dream of yet;\nEnough then for your wonder. But come on,\nContract us ’fore these witnesses.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nCome, your hand;\nAnd, daughter, yours.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\nHave you a father?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nI have; but what of him?\n\nPOLIXENES.\nKnows he of this?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nHe neither does nor shall.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nMethinks a father\nIs at the nuptial of his son a guest\nThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\nIs not your father grown incapable\nOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\nWith age and alt’ring rheums? can he speak? hear?\nKnow man from man? dispute his own estate?\nLies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\nBut what he did being childish?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nNo, good sir;\nHe has his health, and ampler strength indeed\nThan most have of his age.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nBy my white beard,\nYou offer him, if this be so, a wrong\nSomething unfilial: reason my son\nShould choose himself a wife, but as good reason\nThe father, all whose joy is nothing else\nBut fair posterity, should hold some counsel\nIn such a business.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nI yield all this;\nBut for some other reasons, my grave sir,\nWhich ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint\nMy father of this business.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nLet him know ’t.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nHe shall not.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nPrithee let him.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nNo, he must not.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nLet him, my son: he shall not need to grieve\nAt knowing of thy choice.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nCome, come, he must not.\nMark our contract.\n\nPOLIXENES.\n[Discovering himself.] Mark your divorce, young sir,\nWhom son I dare not call; thou art too base\nTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre’s heir,\nThat thus affects a sheep-hook! Thou, old traitor,\nI am sorry that, by hanging thee, I can\nBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece\nOf excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know\nThe royal fool thou cop’st with,—\n\nSHEPHERD.\nO, my heart!\n\nPOLIXENES.\nI’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers and made\nMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,\nIf I may ever know thou dost but sigh\nThat thou no more shalt see this knack (as never\nI mean thou shalt), we’ll bar thee from succession;\nNot hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,\nFar than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.\nFollow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,\nThough full of our displeasure, yet we free thee\nFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment,\nWorthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too\nThat makes himself, but for our honour therein,\nUnworthy thee. If ever henceforth thou\nThese rural latches to his entrance open,\nOr hoop his body more with thy embraces,\nI will devise a death as cruel for thee\nAs thou art tender to ’t.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPERDITA.\nEven here undone.\nI was not much afeard, for once or twice\nI was about to speak, and tell him plainly\nThe selfsame sun that shines upon his court\nHides not his visage from our cottage, but\nLooks on alike. [To Florizel.] Will’t please you, sir, be gone?\nI told you what would come of this. Beseech you,\nOf your own state take care. This dream of mine—\nBeing now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther,\nBut milk my ewes, and weep.\n\nCAMILLO.\nWhy, how now, father!\nSpeak ere thou diest.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nI cannot speak, nor think,\nNor dare to know that which I know. O sir,\nYou have undone a man of fourscore three,\nThat thought to fill his grave in quiet; yea,\nTo die upon the bed my father died,\nTo lie close by his honest bones; but now\nSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay me\nWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,\nThat knew’st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure\nTo mingle faith with him! Undone, undone!\nIf I might die within this hour, I have liv’d\nTo die when I desire.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nFLORIZEL.\nWhy look you so upon me?\nI am but sorry, not afeard; delay’d,\nBut nothing alt’red: what I was, I am:\nMore straining on for plucking back; not following\nMy leash unwillingly.\n\nCAMILLO.\nGracious my lord,\nYou know your father’s temper: at this time\nHe will allow no speech (which I do guess\nYou do not purpose to him) and as hardly\nWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\nThen, till the fury of his highness settle,\nCome not before him.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nI not purpose it.\nI think Camillo?\n\nCAMILLO.\nEven he, my lord.\n\nPERDITA.\nHow often have I told you ’twould be thus!\nHow often said my dignity would last\nBut till ’twere known!\n\nFLORIZEL.\nIt cannot fail but by\nThe violation of my faith; and then\nLet nature crush the sides o’ th’ earth together\nAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks.\nFrom my succession wipe me, father; I\nAm heir to my affection.\n\nCAMILLO.\nBe advis’d.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nI am, and by my fancy. If my reason\nWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;\nIf not, my senses, better pleas’d with madness,\nDo bid it welcome.\n\nCAMILLO.\nThis is desperate, sir.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nSo call it: but it does fulfil my vow.\nI needs must think it honesty. Camillo,\nNot for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may\nBe thereat glean’d; for all the sun sees or\nThe close earth wombs, or the profound seas hides\nIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oath\nTo this my fair belov’d. Therefore, I pray you,\nAs you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend,\nWhen he shall miss me,—as, in faith, I mean not\nTo see him any more,—cast your good counsels\nUpon his passion: let myself and fortune\nTug for the time to come. This you may know,\nAnd so deliver, I am put to sea\nWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;\nAnd, most opportune to her need, I have\nA vessel rides fast by, but not prepar’d\nFor this design. What course I mean to hold\nShall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor\nConcern me the reporting.\n\nCAMILLO.\nO my lord,\nI would your spirit were easier for advice,\nOr stronger for your need.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nHark, Perdita. [Takes her aside.]\n[To Camillo.] I’ll hear you by and by.\n\nCAMILLO.\nHe’s irremovable,\nResolv’d for flight. Now were I happy if\nHis going I could frame to serve my turn,\nSave him from danger, do him love and honour,\nPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\nAnd that unhappy king, my master, whom\nI so much thirst to see.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nNow, good Camillo,\nI am so fraught with curious business that\nI leave out ceremony.\n\nCAMILLO.\nSir, I think\nYou have heard of my poor services, i’ th’ love\nThat I have borne your father?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nVery nobly\nHave you deserv’d: it is my father’s music\nTo speak your deeds, not little of his care\nTo have them recompens’d as thought on.\n\nCAMILLO.\nWell, my lord,\nIf you may please to think I love the king,\nAnd, through him, what’s nearest to him, which is\nYour gracious self, embrace but my direction,\nIf your more ponderous and settled project\nMay suffer alteration. On mine honour,\nI’ll point you where you shall have such receiving\nAs shall become your highness; where you may\nEnjoy your mistress; from the whom, I see,\nThere’s no disjunction to be made, but by,\nAs heavens forfend, your ruin. Marry her,\nAnd with my best endeavours in your absence\nYour discontenting father strive to qualify\nAnd bring him up to liking.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nHow, Camillo,\nMay this, almost a miracle, be done?\nThat I may call thee something more than man,\nAnd after that trust to thee.\n\nCAMILLO.\nHave you thought on\nA place whereto you’ll go?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nNot any yet.\nBut as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty\nTo what we wildly do, so we profess\nOurselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies\nOf every wind that blows.\n\nCAMILLO.\nThen list to me:\nThis follows, if you will not change your purpose,\nBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\nAnd there present yourself and your fair princess,\nFor so, I see, she must be, ’fore Leontes:\nShe shall be habited as it becomes\nThe partner of your bed. Methinks I see\nLeontes opening his free arms and weeping\nHis welcomes forth; asks thee, the son, forgiveness,\nAs ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands\nOf your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him\n’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one\nHe chides to hell, and bids the other grow\nFaster than thought or time.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nWorthy Camillo,\nWhat colour for my visitation shall I\nHold up before him?\n\nCAMILLO.\nSent by the king your father\nTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\nThe manner of your bearing towards him, with\nWhat you (as from your father) shall deliver,\nThings known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,\nThe which shall point you forth at every sitting\nWhat you must say; that he shall not perceive\nBut that you have your father’s bosom there\nAnd speak his very heart.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nI am bound to you:\nThere is some sap in this.\n\nCAMILLO.\nA course more promising\nThan a wild dedication of yourselves\nTo unpath’d waters, undream’d shores, most certain\nTo miseries enough: no hope to help you,\nBut as you shake off one to take another:\nNothing so certain as your anchors, who\nDo their best office if they can but stay you\nWhere you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know\nProsperity’s the very bond of love,\nWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together\nAffliction alters.\n\nPERDITA.\nOne of these is true:\nI think affliction may subdue the cheek,\nBut not take in the mind.\n\nCAMILLO.\nYea, say you so?\nThere shall not at your father’s house, these seven years\nBe born another such.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nMy good Camillo,\nShe is as forward of her breeding as\nShe is i’ th’ rear our birth.\n\nCAMILLO.\nI cannot say ’tis pity\nShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\nTo most that teach.\n\nPERDITA.\nYour pardon, sir; for this\nI’ll blush you thanks.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nMy prettiest Perdita!\nBut, O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,\nPreserver of my father, now of me,\nThe medicine of our house, how shall we do?\nWe are not furnish’d like Bohemia’s son,\nNor shall appear in Sicilia.\n\nCAMILLO.\nMy lord,\nFear none of this. I think you know my fortunes\nDo all lie there: it shall be so my care\nTo have you royally appointed as if\nThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\nThat you may know you shall not want,—one word.\n[They talk aside.]\n\nEnter Autolycus.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nHa, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery. Not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer: by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembered. My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have filed keys off that hung in chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and the king’s son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.\n\nCamillo, Florizel and Perdita come forward.\n\nCAMILLO.\nNay, but my letters, by this means being there\nSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nAnd those that you’ll procure from king Leontes?\n\nCAMILLO.\nShall satisfy your father.\n\nPERDITA.\nHappy be you!\nAll that you speak shows fair.\n\nCAMILLO.\n[Seeing Autolycus.] Who have we here?\nWe’ll make an instrument of this; omit\nNothing may give us aid.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\n[Aside.] If they have overheard me now,—why, hanging.\n\nCAMILLO.\nHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear not, man; here’s no harm intended to thee.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\n\nCAMILLO.\nWhy, be so still; here’s nobody will steal that from thee: yet, for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,—thou must think there’s a necessity in’t—and change garments with this gentleman: though the pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, there’s some boot.\n\n[Giving money.]\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI am a poor fellow, sir: [Aside.] I know ye well enough.\n\nCAMILLO.\nNay, prithee dispatch: the gentleman is half flayed already.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nAre you in earnest, sir? [Aside.] I smell the trick on’t.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nDispatch, I prithee.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nIndeed, I have had earnest; but I cannot with conscience take it.\n\nCAMILLO.\nUnbuckle, unbuckle.\n\n[Florizel and Autolycus exchange garments.]\n\nFortunate mistress,—let my prophecy\nCome home to you!—you must retire yourself\nInto some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat\nAnd pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,\nDismantle you; and, as you can, disliken\nThe truth of your own seeming; that you may\n(For I do fear eyes over) to shipboard\nGet undescried.\n\nPERDITA.\nI see the play so lies\nThat I must bear a part.\n\nCAMILLO.\nNo remedy.\nHave you done there?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nShould I now meet my father,\nHe would not call me son.\n\nCAMILLO.\nNay, you shall have no hat. [Giving it to Perdita.]\nCome, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nAdieu, sir.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nO Perdita, what have we twain forgot?\nPray you a word.\n\n[They converse apart.]\n\nCAMILLO.\n[Aside.] What I do next, shall be to tell the king\nOf this escape, and whither they are bound;\nWherein my hope is I shall so prevail\nTo force him after: in whose company\nI shall re-view Sicilia; for whose sight\nI have a woman’s longing.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nFortune speed us!\nThus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.\n\nCAMILLO.\nThe swifter speed the better.\n\n[Exeunt Florizel, Perdita and Camillo.]\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI understand the business, I hear it. To have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this been without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not do’t: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.\n\nEnter Clown and Shepherd.\n\nAside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: every lane’s end, every shop, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man work.\n\nCLOWN.\nSee, see; what a man you are now! There is no other way but to tell the king she’s a changeling, and none of your flesh and blood.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nNay, but hear me.\n\nCLOWN.\nNay, but hear me.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nGo to, then.\n\nCLOWN.\nShe being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the king; and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show those things you found about her, those secret things, all but what she has with her: this being done, let the law go whistle, I warrant you.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nI will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his son’s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make me the king’s brother-in-law.\n\nCLOWN.\nIndeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him, and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\n[Aside.] Very wisely, puppies!\n\nSHEPHERD.\nWell, let us to the king: there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\n[Aside.] I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master.\n\nCLOWN.\nPray heartily he be at’ palace.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\n[Aside.] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes by chance. Let me pocket up my pedlar’s excrement. [Takes off his false beard.] How now, rustics! whither are you bound?\n\nSHEPHERD.\nTo the palace, an it like your worship.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nYour affairs there, what, with whom, the condition of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known? discover!\n\nCLOWN.\nWe are but plain fellows, sir.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nA lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie; but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore they do not give us the lie.\n\nCLOWN.\nYour worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself with the manner.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nAre you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nWhether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? receives not thy nose court-odour from me? reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt? Think’st thou, for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier cap-a-pe, and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there. Whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nMy business, sir, is to the king.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nWhat advocate hast thou to him?\n\nSHEPHERD.\nI know not, an ’t like you.\n\nCLOWN.\nAdvocate’s the court-word for a pheasant. Say you have none.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nNone, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nHow bless’d are we that are not simple men!\nYet nature might have made me as these are,\nTherefore I will not disdain.\n\nCLOWN.\nThis cannot be but a great courtier.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nHis garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: a great man, I’ll warrant; I know by the picking on’s teeth.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nThe fardel there? What’s i’ th’ fardel? Wherefore that box?\n\nSHEPHERD.\nSir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king; and which he shall know within this hour, if I may come to th’ speech of him.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nAge, thou hast lost thy labour.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nWhy, sir?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nThe king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for, if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must know the king is full of grief.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nSo ’tis said, sir; about his son, that should have married a shepherd’s daughter.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nIf that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.\n\nCLOWN.\nThink you so, sir?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nNot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall all come under the hangman: which, though it be great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheepcote! All deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.\n\nCLOWN.\nHas the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear, an ’t like you, sir?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nHe has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then ’nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasp’s nest; then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead; then recovered again with aqua-vitæ or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at, their offences being so capital? Tell me (for you seem to be honest plain men) what you have to the king. Being something gently considered, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe seems to be of great authority: close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember: “ston’d” and “flayed alive”.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nAn ’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nAfter I have done what I promised?\n\nSHEPHERD.\nAy, sir.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nWell, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?\n\nCLOWN.\nIn some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nO, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son. Hang him, he’ll be made an example.\n\nCLOWN.\nComfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show our strange sights. He must know ’tis none of your daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be brought you.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on the right-hand. I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you.\n\nCLOWN.\nWe are blessed in this man, as I may say, even blessed.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nLet’s before, as he bids us. He was provided to do us good.\n\n[Exeunt Shepherd and Clown.]\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nIf I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion: gold, and a means to do the prince my master good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious; for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to ’t. To him will I present them. There may be matter in it.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"ACT V\nSCENE I. Sicilia. A Room in the palace of Leontes.\nEnter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina and others.\n\nCLEOMENES\nSir, you have done enough, and have perform’d\nA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make\nWhich you have not redeem’d; indeed, paid down\nMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,\nDo as the heavens have done, forget your evil;\nWith them, forgive yourself.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhilst I remember\nHer and her virtues, I cannot forget\nMy blemishes in them; and so still think of\nThe wrong I did myself: which was so much\nThat heirless it hath made my kingdom, and\nDestroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man\nBred his hopes out of.\n\nPAULINA.\nTrue, too true, my lord.\nIf, one by one, you wedded all the world,\nOr from the all that are took something good,\nTo make a perfect woman, she you kill’d\nWould be unparallel’d.\n\nLEONTES.\nI think so. Kill’d!\nShe I kill’d! I did so: but thou strik’st me\nSorely, to say I did: it is as bitter\nUpon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,\nSay so but seldom.\n\nCLEOMENES\nNot at all, good lady.\nYou might have spoken a thousand things that would\nHave done the time more benefit and grac’d\nYour kindness better.\n\nPAULINA.\nYou are one of those\nWould have him wed again.\n\nDION.\nIf you would not so,\nYou pity not the state, nor the remembrance\nOf his most sovereign name; consider little\nWhat dangers, by his highness’ fail of issue,\nMay drop upon his kingdom, and devour\nIncertain lookers-on. What were more holy\nThan to rejoice the former queen is well?\nWhat holier than, for royalty’s repair,\nFor present comfort, and for future good,\nTo bless the bed of majesty again\nWith a sweet fellow to ’t?\n\nPAULINA.\nThere is none worthy,\nRespecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods\nWill have fulfill’d their secret purposes;\nFor has not the divine Apollo said,\nIs ’t not the tenor of his oracle,\nThat king Leontes shall not have an heir\nTill his lost child be found? Which that it shall,\nIs all as monstrous to our human reason\nAs my Antigonus to break his grave\nAnd come again to me; who, on my life,\nDid perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel\nMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,\nOppose against their wills. [To Leontes.] Care not for issue;\nThe crown will find an heir. Great Alexander\nLeft his to th’ worthiest; so his successor\nWas like to be the best.\n\nLEONTES.\nGood Paulina,\nWho hast the memory of Hermione,\nI know, in honour, O that ever I\nHad squar’d me to thy counsel! Then, even now,\nI might have look’d upon my queen’s full eyes,\nHave taken treasure from her lips,—\n\nPAULINA.\nAnd left them\nMore rich for what they yielded.\n\nLEONTES.\nThou speak’st truth.\nNo more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,\nAnd better us’d, would make her sainted spirit\nAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,\n(Where we offenders now appear) soul-vexed,\nAnd begin “Why to me?”\n\nPAULINA.\nHad she such power,\nShe had just cause.\n\nLEONTES.\nShe had; and would incense me\nTo murder her I married.\n\nPAULINA.\nI should so.\nWere I the ghost that walk’d, I’d bid you mark\nHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t\nYou chose her: then I’d shriek, that even your ears\nShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow’d\nShould be “Remember mine.”\n\nLEONTES.\nStars, stars,\nAnd all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;\nI’ll have no wife, Paulina.\n\nPAULINA.\nWill you swear\nNever to marry but by my free leave?\n\nLEONTES.\nNever, Paulina; so be bless’d my spirit!\n\nPAULINA.\nThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\n\nCLEOMENES\nYou tempt him over-much.\n\nPAULINA.\nUnless another,\nAs like Hermione as is her picture,\nAffront his eye.\n\nCLEOMENES\nGood madam,—\n\nPAULINA.\nI have done.\nYet, if my lord will marry,—if you will, sir,\nNo remedy but you will,—give me the office\nTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so young\nAs was your former, but she shall be such\nAs, walk’d your first queen’s ghost, it should take joy\nTo see her in your arms.\n\nLEONTES.\nMy true Paulina,\nWe shall not marry till thou bid’st us.\n\nPAULINA.\nThat\nShall be when your first queen’s again in breath;\nNever till then.\n\nEnter a Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nOne that gives out himself Prince Florizel,\nSon of Polixenes, with his princess (she\nThe fairest I have yet beheld) desires access\nTo your high presence.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhat with him? he comes not\nLike to his father’s greatness: his approach,\nSo out of circumstance and sudden, tells us\n’Tis not a visitation fram’d, but forc’d\nBy need and accident. What train?\n\nSERVANT.\nBut few,\nAnd those but mean.\n\nLEONTES.\nHis princess, say you, with him?\n\nSERVANT.\nAy, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,\nThat e’er the sun shone bright on.\n\nPAULINA.\nO Hermione,\nAs every present time doth boast itself\nAbove a better gone, so must thy grave\nGive way to what’s seen now! Sir, you yourself\nHave said and writ so,—but your writing now\nIs colder than that theme,—‘She had not been,\nNor was not to be equall’d’; thus your verse\nFlow’d with her beauty once; ’tis shrewdly ebb’d,\nTo say you have seen a better.\n\nSERVANT.\nPardon, madam:\nThe one I have almost forgot,—your pardon;—\nThe other, when she has obtain’d your eye,\nWill have your tongue too. This is a creature,\nWould she begin a sect, might quench the zeal\nOf all professors else; make proselytes\nOf who she but bid follow.\n\nPAULINA.\nHow! not women?\n\nSERVANT.\nWomen will love her that she is a woman\nMore worth than any man; men, that she is\nThe rarest of all women.\n\nLEONTES.\nGo, Cleomenes;\nYourself, assisted with your honour’d friends,\nBring them to our embracement.\n\n[Exeunt Cleomenes and others.]\n\nStill, ’tis strange\nHe thus should steal upon us.\n\nPAULINA.\nHad our prince,\nJewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair’d\nWell with this lord. There was not full a month\nBetween their births.\n\nLEONTES.\nPrithee no more; cease; Thou know’st\nHe dies to me again when talk’d of: sure,\nWhen I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches\nWill bring me to consider that which may\nUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.\n\nEnter Florizel, Perdita, Cleomenes and others.\n\nYour mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\nFor she did print your royal father off,\nConceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,\nYour father’s image is so hit in you,\nHis very air, that I should call you brother,\nAs I did him, and speak of something wildly\nBy us perform’d before. Most dearly welcome!\nAnd your fair princess,—goddess! O, alas!\nI lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and earth\nMight thus have stood, begetting wonder, as\nYou, gracious couple, do! And then I lost,—\nAll mine own folly,—the society,\nAmity too, of your brave father, whom,\nThough bearing misery, I desire my life\nOnce more to look on him.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nBy his command\nHave I here touch’d Sicilia, and from him\nGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,\nCan send his brother: and, but infirmity,\nWhich waits upon worn times, hath something seiz’d\nHis wish’d ability, he had himself\nThe lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his\nMeasur’d, to look upon you; whom he loves,\nHe bade me say so,—more than all the sceptres\nAnd those that bear them living.\n\nLEONTES.\nO my brother,—\nGood gentleman!—the wrongs I have done thee stir\nAfresh within me; and these thy offices,\nSo rarely kind, are as interpreters\nOf my behind-hand slackness! Welcome hither,\nAs is the spring to the earth. And hath he too\nExpos’d this paragon to the fearful usage,\nAt least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,\nTo greet a man not worth her pains, much less\nTh’ adventure of her person?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nGood, my lord,\nShe came from Libya.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhere the warlike Smalus,\nThat noble honour’d lord, is fear’d and lov’d?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nMost royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter\nHis tears proclaim’d his, parting with her: thence,\nA prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross’d,\nTo execute the charge my father gave me\nFor visiting your highness: my best train\nI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss’d;\nWho for Bohemia bend, to signify\nNot only my success in Libya, sir,\nBut my arrival, and my wife’s, in safety\nHere, where we are.\n\nLEONTES.\nThe blessed gods\nPurge all infection from our air whilst you\nDo climate here! You have a holy father,\nA graceful gentleman; against whose person,\nSo sacred as it is, I have done sin,\nFor which the heavens, taking angry note,\nHave left me issueless. And your father’s bless’d,\nAs he from heaven merits it, with you,\nWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,\nMight I a son and daughter now have look’d on,\nSuch goodly things as you!\n\nEnter a Lord.\n\nLORD.\nMost noble sir,\nThat which I shall report will bear no credit,\nWere not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,\nBohemia greets you from himself by me;\nDesires you to attach his son, who has—\nHis dignity and duty both cast off—\nFled from his father, from his hopes, and with\nA shepherd’s daughter.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhere’s Bohemia? speak.\n\nLORD.\nHere in your city; I now came from him.\nI speak amazedly, and it becomes\nMy marvel and my message. To your court\nWhiles he was hast’ning—in the chase, it seems,\nOf this fair couple—meets he on the way\nThe father of this seeming lady and\nHer brother, having both their country quitted\nWith this young prince.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nCamillo has betray’d me;\nWhose honour and whose honesty till now,\nEndur’d all weathers.\n\nLORD.\nLay ’t so to his charge.\nHe’s with the king your father.\n\nLEONTES.\nWho? Camillo?\n\nLORD.\nCamillo, sir; I spake with him; who now\nHas these poor men in question. Never saw I\nWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;\nForswear themselves as often as they speak.\nBohemia stops his ears, and threatens them\nWith divers deaths in death.\n\nPERDITA.\nO my poor father!\nThe heaven sets spies upon us, will not have\nOur contract celebrated.\n\nLEONTES.\nYou are married?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nWe are not, sir, nor are we like to be.\nThe stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.\nThe odds for high and low’s alike.\n\nLEONTES.\nMy lord,\nIs this the daughter of a king?\n\nFLORIZEL.\nShe is,\nWhen once she is my wife.\n\nLEONTES.\nThat “once”, I see by your good father’s speed,\nWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,\nMost sorry, you have broken from his liking,\nWhere you were tied in duty; and as sorry\nYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,\nThat you might well enjoy her.\n\nFLORIZEL.\nDear, look up:\nThough Fortune, visible an enemy,\nShould chase us with my father, power no jot\nHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,\nRemember since you ow’d no more to time\nThan I do now: with thought of such affections,\nStep forth mine advocate. At your request\nMy father will grant precious things as trifles.\n\nLEONTES.\nWould he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,\nWhich he counts but a trifle.\n\nPAULINA.\nSir, my liege,\nYour eye hath too much youth in ’t: not a month\n’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes\nThan what you look on now.\n\nLEONTES.\nI thought of her\nEven in these looks I made. [To Florizel.] But your petition\nIs yet unanswer’d. I will to your father.\nYour honour not o’erthrown by your desires,\nI am friend to them and you: upon which errand\nI now go toward him; therefore follow me,\nAnd mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. The same. Before the Palace.\nEnter Autolycus and a Gentleman.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nBeseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI would most gladly know the issue of it.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be. Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more.\n\nEnter a Gentleman.\n\nThe news, Rogero?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nNothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled: the king’s daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward: he can deliver you more.\n\nEnter a third Gentleman.\n\nHow goes it now, sir? This news, which is called true, is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the king found his heir?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nMost true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nNo.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nThen you have lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries “O, thy mother, thy mother!” then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nWhat, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nLike an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWhat became of his bark and his followers?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nWrecked the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of the shepherd: so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nThe dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes; for by such was it acted.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nOne of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water, though not the fish) was, when at the relation of the queen’s death (with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king) how attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did, with an “Alas,” I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world could have seen it, the woe had been universal.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nAre they returned to the court?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nNo: the princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina,—a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity, and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nI thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWho would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Let’s along.\n\n[Exeunt Gentlemen.]\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nNow, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what. But he at that time over-fond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be), who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscover’d. But ’tis all one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish’d among my other discredits.\n\nEnter Shepherd and Clown.\n\nHere come those I have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nCome, boy; I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.\n\nCLOWN.\nYou are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\n\nCLOWN.\nAy, and have been so any time these four hours.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nAnd so have I, boy!\n\nCLOWN.\nSo you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the king’s son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince, my brother, and the princess, my sister, called my father father; and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nWe may live, son, to shed many more.\n\nCLOWN.\nAy; or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the prince my master.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nPrithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.\n\nCLOWN.\nThou wilt amend thy life?\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nAy, an it like your good worship.\n\nCLOWN.\nGive me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nYou may say it, but not swear it.\n\nCLOWN.\nNot swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it, I’ll swear it.\n\nSHEPHERD.\nHow if it be false, son?\n\nCLOWN.\nIf it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend. And I’ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk: but I’ll swear it; and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.\n\nAUTOLYCUS.\nI will prove so, sir, to my power.\n\nCLOWN.\nAy, by any means, prove a tall fellow: if I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the queen’s picture. Come, follow us: we’ll be thy good masters.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. The same. A Room in Paulina’s house.\nEnter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords and Attendants.\n\nLEONTES.\nO grave and good Paulina, the great comfort\nThat I have had of thee!\n\nPAULINA.\nWhat, sovereign sir,\nI did not well, I meant well. All my services\nYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf’d,\nWith your crown’d brother and these your contracted\nHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,\nIt is a surplus of your grace which never\nMy life may last to answer.\n\nLEONTES.\nO Paulina,\nWe honour you with trouble. But we came\nTo see the statue of our queen: your gallery\nHave we pass’d through, not without much content\nIn many singularities; but we saw not\nThat which my daughter came to look upon,\nThe statue of her mother.\n\nPAULINA.\nAs she liv’d peerless,\nSo her dead likeness, I do well believe,\nExcels whatever yet you look’d upon\nOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it\nLonely, apart. But here it is: prepare\nTo see the life as lively mock’d as ever\nStill sleep mock’d death. Behold, and say ’tis well.\n\nPaulina undraws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing as a statue.\n\nI like your silence, it the more shows off\nYour wonder: but yet speak. First you, my liege.\nComes it not something near?\n\nLEONTES.\nHer natural posture!\nChide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed\nThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she\nIn thy not chiding; for she was as tender\nAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,\nHermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing\nSo aged as this seems.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nO, not by much!\n\nPAULINA.\nSo much the more our carver’s excellence,\nWhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\nAs she liv’d now.\n\nLEONTES.\nAs now she might have done,\nSo much to my good comfort as it is\nNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,\nEven with such life of majesty, warm life,\nAs now it coldly stands, when first I woo’d her!\nI am asham’d: does not the stone rebuke me\nFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,\nThere’s magic in thy majesty, which has\nMy evils conjur’d to remembrance and\nFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,\nStanding like stone with thee.\n\nPERDITA.\nAnd give me leave,\nAnd do not say ’tis superstition, that\nI kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady,\nDear queen, that ended when I but began,\nGive me that hand of yours to kiss.\n\nPAULINA.\nO, patience!\nThe statue is but newly fix’d, the colour’s\nNot dry.\n\nCAMILLO.\nMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\nWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away,\nSo many summers dry. Scarce any joy\nDid ever so long live; no sorrow\nBut kill’d itself much sooner.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nDear my brother,\nLet him that was the cause of this have power\nTo take off so much grief from you as he\nWill piece up in himself.\n\nPAULINA.\nIndeed, my lord,\nIf I had thought the sight of my poor image\nWould thus have wrought you—for the stone is mine—\nI’d not have show’d it.\n\nLEONTES.\nDo not draw the curtain.\n\nPAULINA.\nNo longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy\nMay think anon it moves.\n\nLEONTES.\nLet be, let be.\nWould I were dead, but that methinks already—\nWhat was he that did make it? See, my lord,\nWould you not deem it breath’d? And that those veins\nDid verily bear blood?\n\nPOLIXENES.\nMasterly done:\nThe very life seems warm upon her lip.\n\nLEONTES.\nThe fixture of her eye has motion in ’t,\nAs we are mock’d with art.\n\nPAULINA.\nI’ll draw the curtain:\nMy lord’s almost so far transported that\nHe’ll think anon it lives.\n\nLEONTES.\nO sweet Paulina,\nMake me to think so twenty years together!\nNo settled senses of the world can match\nThe pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.\n\nPAULINA.\nI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you: but\nI could afflict you further.\n\nLEONTES.\nDo, Paulina;\nFor this affliction has a taste as sweet\nAs any cordial comfort. Still methinks\nThere is an air comes from her. What fine chisel\nCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,\nFor I will kiss her!\n\nPAULINA.\nGood my lord, forbear:\nThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\nYou’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\nWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\n\nLEONTES.\nNo, not these twenty years.\n\nPERDITA.\nSo long could I\nStand by, a looker on.\n\nPAULINA.\nEither forbear,\nQuit presently the chapel, or resolve you\nFor more amazement. If you can behold it,\nI’ll make the statue move indeed, descend,\nAnd take you by the hand. But then you’ll think\n(Which I protest against) I am assisted\nBy wicked powers.\n\nLEONTES.\nWhat you can make her do\nI am content to look on: what to speak,\nI am content to hear; for ’tis as easy\nTo make her speak as move.\n\nPAULINA.\nIt is requir’d\nYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\nOr those that think it is unlawful business\nI am about, let them depart.\n\nLEONTES.\nProceed:\nNo foot shall stir.\n\nPAULINA.\nMusic, awake her: strike! [Music.]\n’Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\nStrike all that look upon with marvel. Come;\nI’ll fill your grave up: stir; nay, come away.\nBequeath to death your numbness, for from him\nDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs.\n\nHermione comes down from the pedestal.\n\nStart not; her actions shall be holy as\nYou hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her\nUntil you see her die again; for then\nYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\nWhen she was young you woo’d her; now in age\nIs she become the suitor?\n\nLEONTES.\n[Embracing her.] O, she’s warm!\nIf this be magic, let it be an art\nLawful as eating.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nShe embraces him.\n\nCAMILLO.\nShe hangs about his neck.\nIf she pertain to life, let her speak too.\n\nPOLIXENES.\nAy, and make it manifest where she has liv’d,\nOr how stol’n from the dead.\n\nPAULINA.\nThat she is living,\nWere it but told you, should be hooted at\nLike an old tale; but it appears she lives,\nThough yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\nPlease you to interpose, fair madam. Kneel\nAnd pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady,\nOur Perdita is found.\n\n[Presenting Perdita who kneels to Hermione.]\n\nHERMIONE.\nYou gods, look down,\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\nUpon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,\nWhere hast thou been preserv’d? where liv’d? how found\nThy father’s court? for thou shalt hear that I,\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserv’d\nMyself to see the issue.\n\nPAULINA.\nThere’s time enough for that;\nLest they desire upon this push to trouble\nYour joys with like relation. Go together,\nYou precious winners all; your exultation\nPartake to everyone. I, an old turtle,\nWill wing me to some wither’d bough, and there\nMy mate, that’s never to be found again,\nLament till I am lost.\n\nLEONTES.\nO peace, Paulina!\nThou shouldst a husband take by my consent,\nAs I by thine a wife: this is a match,\nAnd made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine;\nBut how, is to be question’d; for I saw her,\nAs I thought, dead; and have in vain said many\nA prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far—\nFor him, I partly know his mind—to find thee\nAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,\nAnd take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty\nIs richly noted, and here justified\nBy us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.\nWhat! look upon my brother: both your pardons,\nThat e’er I put between your holy looks\nMy ill suspicion. This your son-in-law,\nAnd son unto the king, whom heavens directing,\nIs troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,\nLead us from hence; where we may leisurely\nEach one demand, and answer to his part\nPerform’d in this wide gap of time, since first\nWe were dissever’d. Hastily lead away!\n\n[Exeunt.]",
