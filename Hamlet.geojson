Stand, ho! Who is there?\nHORATIO.\nFriends to this ground.\nMARCELLUS.\nAnd liegemen to the Dane.\nFRANCISCO.\nGive you good night.\nMARCELLUS.\nO, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev’d you?\nFRANCISCO.\nBarnardo has my place. Give you good-night.\n[Exit.]\n\nMARCELLUS.\nHolla, Barnardo!\nBARNARDO.\nSay, what, is Horatio there?\nHORATIO.\nA piece of him.\nBARNARDO.\nWelcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.\nMARCELLUS.\nWhat, has this thing appear’d again tonight?\nBARNARDO.\nI have seen nothing.\nMARCELLUS.\nHoratio says ’tis but our fantasy,\nAnd will not let belief take hold of him\nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.\nTherefore I have entreated him along\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night,\nThat if again this apparition come\nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\nHORATIO.\nTush, tush, ’twill not appear.\nBARNARDO.\nSit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears,\nThat are so fortified against our story,\nWhat we two nights have seen.\nHORATIO.\nWell, sit we down,\nAnd let us hear Barnardo speak of this.\nBARNARDO.\nLast night of all,\nWhen yond same star that’s westward from the pole,\nHad made his course t’illume that part of heaven\nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,\nThe bell then beating one—\nMARCELLUS.\nPeace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.\nEnter Ghost.\n\nBARNARDO.\nIn the same figure, like the King that’s dead.\nMARCELLUS.\nThou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\nBARNARDO.\nLooks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\nHORATIO.\nMost like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\nBARNARDO\nIt would be spoke to.\nMARCELLUS.\nQuestion it, Horatio.\nHORATIO.\nWhat art thou that usurp’st this time of night,\nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark\nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.\nMARCELLUS.\nIt is offended.\nBARNARDO.\nSee, it stalks away.\nHORATIO.\nStay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\n[Exit Ghost.]\n\nMARCELLUS.\n’Tis gone, and will not answer.\nBARNARDO.\nHow now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.\nIs not this something more than fantasy?\nWhat think you on’t?\nHORATIO.\nBefore my God, I might not this believe\nWithout the sensible and true avouch\nOf mine own eyes.\nMARCELLUS.\nIs it not like the King?\nHORATIO.\nAs thou art to thyself:\nSuch was the very armour he had on\nWhen he th’ambitious Norway combated;\nSo frown’d he once, when in an angry parle\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\n’Tis strange.\nMARCELLUS.\nThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\nHORATIO.\nIn what particular thought to work I know not;\nBut in the gross and scope of my opinion,\nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\nMARCELLUS.\nGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,\nWhy this same strict and most observant watch\nSo nightly toils the subject of the land,\nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon\nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task\nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.\nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste\nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:\nWho is’t that can inform me?\nHORATIO.\nThat can I;\nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,\nWhose image even but now appear’d to us,\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\nThereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,\nDar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,\nFor so this side of our known world esteem’d him,\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact,\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;\nAgainst the which, a moiety competent\nWas gaged by our King; which had return’d\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,\nHad he been vanquisher; as by the same cov’nant\nAnd carriage of the article design’d,\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\nOf unimproved mettle, hot and full,\nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,\nShark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\nThat hath a stomach in’t; which is no other,\nAs it doth well appear unto our state,\nBut to recover of us by strong hand\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head\nOf this post-haste and rummage in the land.\nBARNARDO.\nI think it be no other but e’en so:\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\nComes armed through our watch so like the King\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\nHORATIO.\nA mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\nThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star,\nUpon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.\nRe-enter Ghost.\n\nBut, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!\nI’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\nSpeak to me.\nIf there be any good thing to be done,\nThat may to thee do ease, and grace to me,\nSpeak to me.\nIf thou art privy to thy country’s fate,\nWhich, happily, foreknowing may avoid,\nO speak!\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\nSpeak of it. Stay, and speak!\n\n[The cock crows.]\n\nStop it, Marcellus!\nMARCELLUS.\nShall I strike at it with my partisan?\nHORATIO.\nDo, if it will not stand.\nBARNARDO.\n’Tis here!\nHORATIO.\n’Tis here!\n[Exit Ghost.]\n\nMARCELLUS.\n’Tis gone!\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\nTo offer it the show of violence,\nFor it is as the air, invulnerable,\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\nBARNARDO.\nIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.\nHORATIO.\nAnd then it started, like a guilty thing\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\nTh’extravagant and erring spirit hies\nTo his confine. And of the truth herein\nThis present object made probation.\nMARCELLUS.\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever ’gainst that season comes\nWherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long;\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,\nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;\nSo hallow’d and so gracious is the time.\nHORATIO.\nSo have I heard, and do in part believe it.\nBut look, the morn in russet mantle clad,\nWalks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up, and by my advice,\nLet us impart what we have seen tonight\nUnto young Hamlet; for upon my life,\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\nMARCELLUS.\nLet’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know\nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.\nEnter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand,\nCornelius, Lords and Attendant.\n\nKING.\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe;\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\nTh’imperial jointress to this warlike state,\nHave we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,\nWith one auspicious and one dropping eye,\nWith mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole,\nTaken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\nWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.\nNow follows, that you know young Fortinbras,\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth,\nOr thinking by our late dear brother’s death\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\nHe hath not fail’d to pester us with message,\nImporting the surrender of those lands\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\nTo our most valiant brother. So much for him.\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting:\nThus much the business is: we have here writ\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,\nWho, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears\nOf this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress\nHis further gait herein; in that the levies,\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\nOut of his subject: and we here dispatch\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway,\nGiving to you no further personal power\nTo business with the King, more than the scope\nOf these dilated articles allow.\nFarewell; and let your haste commend your duty.\nCORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.\nIn that, and all things, will we show our duty.\nKING.\nWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.\n[Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.]\n\nAnd now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?\nYou told us of some suit. What is’t, Laertes?\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane,\nAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\nLAERTES.\nDread my lord,\nYour leave and favour to return to France,\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark\nTo show my duty in your coronation;\nYet now I must confess, that duty done,\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\nKING.\nHave you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?\nPOLONIUS.\nHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\nBy laboursome petition; and at last\nUpon his will I seal’d my hard consent.\nI do beseech you give him leave to go.\nKING.\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will!\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—\nHAMLET.\n[Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind.\nKING.\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\nHAMLET.\nNot so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.\nQUEEN.\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust.\nThou know’st ’tis common, all that lives must die,\nPassing through nature to eternity.\nHAMLET.\nAy, madam, it is common.\nQUEEN.\nIf it be,\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\nHAMLET.\nSeems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.\n’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\nNor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\nNor the dejected haviour of the visage,\nTogether with all forms, moods, shows of grief,\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed seem,\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\nBut I have that within which passeth show;\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\nKING.\n’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\nTo give these mourning duties to your father;\nBut you must know, your father lost a father,\nThat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\nIn filial obligation, for some term\nTo do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\nOf impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief,\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\nAn understanding simple and unschool’d;\nFor what we know must be, and is as common\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\nWhy should we in our peevish opposition\nTake it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\nTo reason most absurd, whose common theme\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\nFrom the first corse till he that died today,\n‘This must be so.’ We pray you throw to earth\nThis unprevailing woe, and think of us\nAs of a father; for let the world take note\nYou are the most immediate to our throne,\nAnd with no less nobility of love\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\nAnd we beseech you bend you to remain\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\nQUEEN.\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.\nI pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\nHAMLET.\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\nKING.\nWhy, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.\nBe as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;\nThis gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet\nSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks today\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\nAnd the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]\n\nHAMLET.\nO that this too too solid flesh would melt,\nThaw, and resolve itself into a dew!\nOr that the Everlasting had not fix’d\nHis canon ’gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\nFie on’t! Oh fie! ’tis an unweeded garden\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\nBut two months dead—nay, not so much, not two:\nSo excellent a king; that was to this\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\nBy what it fed on; and yet, within a month—\nLet me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!\nA little month, or ere those shoes were old\nWith which she followed my poor father’s body\nLike Niobe, all tears.—Why she, even she—\nO God! A beast that wants discourse of reason\nWould have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle,\nMy father’s brother; but no more like my father\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month?\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\nShe married. O most wicked speed, to post\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\nBut break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\nEnter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.\n\nHORATIO.\nHail to your lordship!\nHAMLET.\nI am glad to see you well:\nHoratio, or I do forget myself.\nHORATIO.\nThe same, my lord,\nAnd your poor servant ever.\n\nHAMLET.\nSir, my good friend;\nI’ll change that name with you:\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—\nMarcellus?\nMARCELLUS.\nMy good lord.\nHAMLET.\nI am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.—\nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\nHORATIO.\nA truant disposition, good my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI would not hear your enemy say so;\nNor shall you do my ear that violence,\nTo make it truster of your own report\nAgainst yourself. I know you are no truant.\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\nWe’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.\nHAMLET.\nI prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.\nI think it was to see my mother’s wedding.\nHORATIO.\nIndeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.\nHAMLET.\nThrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats\nDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven\nOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio.\nMy father,—methinks I see my father.\nHORATIO.\nWhere, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nIn my mind’s eye, Horatio.\nHORATIO.\nI saw him once; he was a goodly king.\nHAMLET.\nHe was a man, take him for all in all,\nI shall not look upon his like again.\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\nHAMLET.\nSaw? Who?\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, the King your father.\nHAMLET.\nThe King my father!\nHORATIO.\nSeason your admiration for a while\nWith an attent ear, till I may deliver\nUpon the witness of these gentlemen\nThis marvel to you.\nHAMLET.\nFor God’s love let me hear.\nHORATIO.\nTwo nights together had these gentlemen,\nMarcellus and Barnardo, on their watch\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night,\nBeen thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,\nArmed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,\nAppears before them, and with solemn march\nGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d\nBy their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,\nWithin his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\nStand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch,\nWhere, as they had deliver’d, both in time,\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;\nThese hands are not more like.\nHAMLET.\nBut where was this?\nMARCELLUS.\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch.\nHAMLET.\nDid you not speak to it?\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, I did;\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\nIt lifted up it head, and did address\nItself to motion, like as it would speak.\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\nAnd vanish’d from our sight.\nHAMLET.\n’Tis very strange.\nHORATIO.\nAs I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\nTo let you know of it.\nHAMLET.\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\nHold you the watch tonight?\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nWe do, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nArm’d, say you?\nBoth.\nArm’d, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nFrom top to toe?\nBOTH.\nMy lord, from head to foot.\nHAMLET.\nThen saw you not his face?\nHORATIO.\nO yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, look’d he frowningly?\nHORATIO.\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\nHAMLET.\nPale, or red?\nHORATIO.\nNay, very pale.\nHAMLET.\nAnd fix’d his eyes upon you?\nHORATIO.\nMost constantly.\nHAMLET.\nI would I had been there.\nHORATIO.\nIt would have much amaz’d you.\nHAMLET.\nVery like, very like. Stay’d it long?\nHORATIO.\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nLonger, longer.\nHORATIO.\nNot when I saw’t.\nHAMLET.\nHis beard was grizzled, no?\nHORATIO.\nIt was, as I have seen it in his life,\nA sable silver’d.\nHAMLET.\nI will watch tonight;\nPerchance ’twill walk again.\nHORATIO.\nI warrant you it will.\nHAMLET.\nIf it assume my noble father’s person,\nI’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\nIf you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\nAnd whatsoever else shall hap tonight,\nGive it an understanding, but no tongue.\nI will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.\nUpon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve,\nI’ll visit you.\nALL.\nOur duty to your honour.\nHAMLET.\nYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.\n[Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.]\n\nMy father’s spirit in arms! All is not well;\nI doubt some foul play: would the night were come!\nTill then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,\nThough all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.\n[Exit.]",

Farewell.\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\nAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\nBut let me hear from you.\nOPHELIA.\nDo you doubt that?\nLAERTES.\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood;\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute;\nNo more.\nOPHELIA.\nNo more but so?\nLAERTES.\nThink it no more.\nFor nature crescent does not grow alone\nIn thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\nHis greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\nHe may not, as unvalu’d persons do,\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\nThe sanctity and health of this whole state;\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\nAs he in his particular act and place\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\nTo his unmaster’d importunity.\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\nVirtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos’d,\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\nBe wary then, best safety lies in fear.\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall th’effect of this good lesson keep\nAs watchman to my heart.

There, my blessing with you.\n[Laying his hand on Laertes’s head.]\n\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\nNor any unproportion’d thought his act.\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\nOf each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware\nOf entrance to a quarrel; but being in,\nBear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee.\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice:\nTake each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\nBut not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man;\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be:\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend;\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\nThis above all: to thine own self be true;\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee.\nLAERTES.\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\nPOLONIUS.\nThe time invites you; go, your servants tend.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\nWhat I have said to you.\nOPHELIA.\n’Tis in my memory lock’d,\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell.\n[Exit.]\n\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\nOPHELIA.\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\nPOLONIUS.\nMarry, well bethought:\n’Tis told me he hath very oft of late\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous.\nIf it be so,—as so ’tis put on me,\nAnd that in way of caution,—I must tell you\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\nAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.\nWhat is between you?

Tender yourself more dearly;\nOr,—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\nRoaming it thus,—you’ll tender me a fool.\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord, he hath importun’d me with love\nIn honourable fashion.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\nOPHELIA.\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both,\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve so much in him that he is young;\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\nThe better to beguile. This is for all.\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\nLook to’t, I charge you; come your ways.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall obey, my lord.\n[Exeunt.]",

Something have you heard\nOf Hamlet’s transformation; so I call it,\nSince nor th’exterior nor the inward man\nResembles that it was. What it should be,\nMore than his father’s death, that thus hath put him\nSo much from th’understanding of himself,\nI cannot dream of. I entreat you both\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him,\nAnd since so neighbour’d to his youth and humour,\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\nSome little time, so by your companies\nTo draw him on to pleasures and to gather,\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\nWhether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus\nThat, open’d, lies within our remedy.\nQUEEN.\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you,\nAnd sure I am, two men there are not living\nTo whom he more adheres. If it will please you\nTo show us so much gentry and good will\nAs to expend your time with us awhile,\nFor the supply and profit of our hope,\nYour visitation shall receive such thanks\nAs fits a king’s remembrance.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nBoth your majesties\nMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,\nPut your dread pleasures more into command\nThan to entreaty.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nWe both obey,\nAnd here give up ourselves, in the full bent,\nTo lay our service freely at your feet\nTo be commanded.\nKING.\nThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.\nQUEEN.\nThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.\nAnd I beseech you instantly to visit\nMy too much changed son.

Your noble son is mad.\nMad call I it; for to define true madness,\nWhat is’t but to be nothing else but mad?\nBut let that go.\nQUEEN.\nMore matter, with less art.\nPOLONIUS.\nMadam, I swear I use no art at all.\nThat he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity;\nAnd pity ’tis ’tis true. A foolish figure,\nBut farewell it, for I will use no art.\nMad let us grant him then. And now remains\nThat we find out the cause of this effect,\nOr rather say, the cause of this defect,\nFor this effect defective comes by cause.\nThus it remains, and the remainder thus.

Now gather, and surmise.\n[Reads.]\nTo the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia—\nThat’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; ‘beautified’ is a vile\nphrase: but you shall hear.\n[Reads.]\nthese; in her excellent white bosom, these, &c.\nQUEEN.\nCame this from Hamlet to her?\nPOLONIUS.\nGood madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.\n[Reads.]\n  Doubt thou the stars are fire,\n     Doubt that the sun doth move,\n   Doubt truth to be a liar,\n     But never doubt I love.\nO dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans. But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.\n  Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,\n     HAMLET.\nThis in obedience hath my daughter show’d me;\nAnd more above, hath his solicitings,\nAs they fell out by time, by means, and place,\nAll given to mine ear.\nKING.\nBut how hath she receiv’d his love?\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat do you think of me?\nKING.\nAs of a man faithful and honourable.\nPOLONIUS.\nI would fain prove so. But what might you think,\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing,\nAs I perceiv’d it, I must tell you that,\nBefore my daughter told me, what might you,\nOr my dear Majesty your queen here, think,\nIf I had play’d the desk or table-book,\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\nOr look’d upon this love with idle sight,\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\n‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.\nThis must not be.’ And then I precepts gave her,\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens.\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice,\nAnd he, repulsed,—a short tale to make—\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,\nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\nThence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\nInto the madness wherein now he raves,\nAnd all we wail for.\nKING.\nDo you think ’tis this?\nQUEEN.\nIt may be, very likely.\nPOLONIUS.\nHath there been such a time, I’d fain know that,\nThat I have positively said ‘’Tis so,’\nWhen it prov’d otherwise?\nKING.\nNot that I know.\nPOLONIUS.\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise.\n[Points to his head and shoulder.]\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeed\nWithin the centre.\nKING.\nHow may we try it further?\nPOLONIUS.\nYou know sometimes he walks four hours together\nHere in the lobby.\nQUEEN.\nSo he does indeed.\nPOLONIUS.\nAt such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.\nBe you and I behind an arras then,\nMark the encounter. If he love her not,\nAnd be not from his reason fall’n thereon,\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\nBut keep a farm and carters.\nKING.\nWe will try it.\nEnter Hamlet, reading.\n\nQUEEN.\nBut look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.\nPOLONIUS.\nAway, I do beseech you, both away\nI’ll board him presently. O, give me leave.\n[Exeunt King, Queen and Attendants.]\n\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\n\nHAMLET.\nWell, God-a-mercy.\nPOLONIUS.\nDo you know me, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nExcellent well. You’re a fishmonger.\nPOLONIUS.\nNot I, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThen I would you were so honest a man.\nPOLONIUS.\nHonest, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nAy sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nThat’s very true, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nFor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,—\nHave you a daughter?\n\nPOLONIUS.\nI have, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nLet her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to’t.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nHow say you by that? [Aside.] Still harping on my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?\n\nHAMLET.\nWords, words, words.\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat is the matter, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nBetween who?\nPOLONIUS.\nI mean the matter that you read, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nSlanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down. For you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.\n\nPOLONIUS.\n[Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in’t.—\nWill you walk out of the air, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nInto my grave?\nPOLONIUS.\nIndeed, that is out o’ the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.\nMy honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.\n\nHAMLET.\nYou cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my life.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nFare you well, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThese tedious old fools.\nEnter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nYou go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.\nROSENCRANTZ.\n[To Polonius.] God save you, sir.\n[Exit Polonius.]\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nMy honoured lord!\nROSENCRANTZ.\nMy most dear lord!\nHAMLET.\nMy excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nHappy in that we are not over-happy;\nOn Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.\nHAMLET.\nNor the soles of her shoe?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNeither, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nFaith, her privates we.\nHAMLET.\nIn the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the news?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNone, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.\nHAMLET.\nThen is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nPrison, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nDenmark’s a prison.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nThen is the world one.\nHAMLET.\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWe think not so, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWhy, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.\n\nHAMLET.\nO God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nWhich dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\n\nHAMLET.\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.\n\nHAMLET.\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot reason.\n\nROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\nWe’ll wait upon you.\nHAMLET.\nNo such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTo visit you, my lord, no other occasion.\nHAMLET.\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nWhat should we say, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTo what end, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\n[To Guildenstern.] What say you?\nHAMLET.\n[Aside.] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nMy lord, we were sent for.\nHAMLET.\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable; in action how like an angel, in apprehension, how like a god: the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\nHAMLET.\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.\n\nHAMLET.\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’ sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nEven those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the city.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.\n\nHAMLET.\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNo, indeed, they are not.\nHAMLET.\nHow comes it? Do they grow rusty?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhat, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nFaith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.\n\nHAMLET.\nIs’t possible?\nGUILDENSTERN.\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\nHAMLET.\nDo the boys carry it away?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nAy, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.\nHAMLET.\nIt is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.\n\n[Flourish of trumpets within.]\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nThere are the players.\nHAMLET.\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nIn what, my dear lord?\nHAMLET.\nI am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.\n\nEnter Polonius.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nWell be with you, gentlemen.\nHAMLET.\nHark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nHappily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.\n\nHAMLET.\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.—You say right, sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\nHAMLET.\nMy lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—\nPOLONIUS.\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nBuzz, buzz.\nPOLONIUS.\nUpon my honour.\nHAMLET.\nThen came each actor on his ass—\nPOLONIUS.\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the law of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.\n\nHAMLET.\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat treasure had he, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy—\n   ’One fair daughter, and no more,\n   The which he loved passing well.’\nPOLONIUS.\n[Aside.] Still on my daughter.\nHAMLET.\nAm I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?\nPOLONIUS.\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.\n\nHAMLET.\nNay, that follows not.\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat follows then, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy,\n   As by lot, God wot,\nand then, you know,\n   It came to pass, as most like it was.\nThe first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where my abridgement comes.\n\nEnter four or five Players.\n\nYou are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.\n\nFIRST PLAYER.\nWhat speech, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, ’twas caviare to the general. But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:\n   The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—\nIt is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus—\n   The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\n   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble\n   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,\n   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d\n   With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot\n   Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d\n   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\n   Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,\n   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light\n   To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,\n   And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,\n   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\n   Old grandsire Priam seeks.\nSo, proceed you.\n\nPOLONIUS.\n’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.\n\nFIRST PLAYER.\n   Anon he finds him,\n   Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\n   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\n   Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d,\n   Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\n   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\n   Th’unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\n   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\n   Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\n   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,\n   Which was declining on the milky head\n   Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick.\n   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\n   And like a neutral to his will and matter,\n   Did nothing.\n   But as we often see against some storm,\n   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\n   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below\n   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\n   Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause,\n   Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,\n   And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall\n   On Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne,\n   With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword\n   Now falls on Priam.\n   Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,\n   In general synod, take away her power;\n   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\n   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\n   As low as to the fiends.\nPOLONIUS.\nThis is too long.\nHAMLET.\nIt shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prythee say on.\nHe’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.\nSay on; come to Hecuba.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n   But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,—\nHAMLET.\n‘The mobled queen’?\nPOLONIUS.\nThat’s good! ‘Mobled queen’ is good.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n   Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames\n   With bisson rheum. A clout upon that head\n   Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\n   About her lank and all o’erteemed loins,\n   A blanket, in th’alarm of fear caught up—\n   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d,\n   ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d.\n   But if the gods themselves did see her then,\n   When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\n   In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,\n   The instant burst of clamour that she made,—\n   Unless things mortal move them not at all,—\n   Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\n   And passion in the gods.\nPOLONIUS.\nLook, where he has not turn’d his colour, and has tears in’s eyes. Pray you, no more.\n\nHAMLET.\n’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\nHAMLET.\nGod’s bodikin, man, better. Use every man after his desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nCome, sirs.\nHAMLET.\nFollow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.\n[Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]\n\nDost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play The Murder of Gonzago?\nFIRST PLAYER.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWe’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could you not?\n\nFIRST PLAYER.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nVery well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.\n[Exit First Player.]\n\n[To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern] My good friends, I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nGood my lord.\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\n\nHAMLET.\nAy, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone.\nO what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\nThat from her working all his visage wan’d;\nTears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect,\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\nFor Hecuba?\nWhat’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;\nMake mad the guilty, and appal the free,\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\nAnd can say nothing. No, not for a king\nUpon whose property and most dear life\nA damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?\nWho calls me villain, breaks my pate across?\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\nTweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i’ th’ throat\nAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?\nHa! ’Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\nBut I am pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\nI should have fatted all the region kites\nWith this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\nOh vengeance!\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder’d,\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\nA scullion! Fie upon’t! Foh!\nAbout, my brain! I have heard\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play,\nHave by the very cunning of the scene,\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\nThey have proclaim’d their malefactions.\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\nWith most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players\nPlay something like the murder of my father\nBefore mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;\nI’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\nMay be the devil, and the devil hath power\nT’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\nAbuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds\nMore relative than this. The play’s the thing\nWherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"ACT III\nSCENE I. A room in the Castle.\nEnter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\nKING.\nAnd can you by no drift of circumstance\nGet from him why he puts on this confusion,\nGrating so harshly all his days of quiet\nWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nHe does confess he feels himself distracted,\nBut from what cause he will by no means speak.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nNor do we find him forward to be sounded,\nBut with a crafty madness keeps aloof\nWhen we would bring him on to some confession\nOf his true state.\nQUEEN.\nDid he receive you well?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nMost like a gentleman.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nBut with much forcing of his disposition.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNiggard of question, but of our demands,\nMost free in his reply.\nQUEEN.\nDid you assay him to any pastime?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nMadam, it so fell out that certain players\nWe o’er-raught on the way. Of these we told him,\nAnd there did seem in him a kind of joy\nTo hear of it. They are about the court,\nAnd, as I think, they have already order\nThis night to play before him.\nPOLONIUS.\n’Tis most true;\nAnd he beseech’d me to entreat your Majesties\nTo hear and see the matter.\nKING.\nWith all my heart; and it doth much content me\nTo hear him so inclin’d.\nGood gentlemen, give him a further edge,\nAnd drive his purpose on to these delights.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWe shall, my lord.\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\n\nKING.\nSweet Gertrude, leave us too,\nFor we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,\nThat he, as ’twere by accident, may here\nAffront Ophelia.\nHer father and myself, lawful espials,\nWill so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,\nWe may of their encounter frankly judge,\nAnd gather by him, as he is behav’d,\nIf’t be th’affliction of his love or no\nThat thus he suffers for.\nQUEEN.\nI shall obey you.\nAnd for your part, Ophelia, I do wish\nThat your good beauties be the happy cause\nOf Hamlet’s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues\nWill bring him to his wonted way again,\nTo both your honours.\nOPHELIA.\nMadam, I wish it may.\n[Exit Queen.]\n\nPOLONIUS.\nOphelia, walk you here.—Gracious, so please you,\nWe will bestow ourselves.—[To Ophelia.] Read on this book,\nThat show of such an exercise may colour\nYour loneliness.—We are oft to blame in this,\n’Tis too much prov’d, that with devotion’s visage\nAnd pious action we do sugar o’er\nThe devil himself.\nKING.\n[Aside.] O ’tis too true!\nHow smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!\nThe harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art,\nIs not more ugly to the thing that helps it\nThan is my deed to my most painted word.\nO heavy burden!\nPOLONIUS.\nI hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.\n[Exeunt King and Polonius.]\n\nEnter Hamlet.\n\nHAMLET.\nTo be, or not to be, that is the question:\nWhether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them? To die—to sleep,\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep.\nTo sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause. There’s the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,\nThe pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscover’d country, from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment,\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\nAnd lose the name of action. Soft you now,\nThe fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\nBe all my sins remember’d.\nOPHELIA.\nGood my lord,\nHow does your honour for this many a day?\nHAMLET.\nI humbly thank you; well, well, well.\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\nThat I have longed long to re-deliver.\nI pray you, now receive them.\nHAMLET.\nNo, not I.\nI never gave you aught.\nOPHELIA.\nMy honour’d lord, you know right well you did,\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos’d\nAs made the things more rich; their perfume lost,\nTake these again; for to the noble mind\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\nThere, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nHa, ha! Are you honest?\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord?\nHAMLET.\nAre you fair?\nOPHELIA.\nWhat means your lordship?\nHAMLET.\nThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.\n\nOPHELIA.\nCould beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?\nHAMLET.\nAy, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.\n\nOPHELIA.\nIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\nHAMLET.\nYou should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.\n\nOPHELIA.\nI was the more deceived.\nHAMLET.\nGet thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?\n\nOPHELIA.\nAt home, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nLet the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own house. Farewell.\n\nOPHELIA.\nO help him, you sweet heavens!\nHAMLET.\nIf thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.\n\nOPHELIA.\nO heavenly powers, restore him!\nHAMLET.\nI have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on’t, it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOPHELIA.\nO, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!\nThe courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword,\nTh’expectancy and rose of the fair state,\nThe glass of fashion and the mould of form,\nTh’observ’d of all observers, quite, quite down!\nAnd I, of ladies most deject and wretched,\nThat suck’d the honey of his music vows,\nNow see that noble and most sovereign reason,\nLike sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh,\nThat unmatch’d form and feature of blown youth\nBlasted with ecstasy. O woe is me,\nT’have seen what I have seen, see what I see.\nEnter King and Polonius.\n\nKING.\nLove? His affections do not that way tend,\nNor what he spake, though it lack’d form a little,\nWas not like madness. There’s something in his soul\nO’er which his melancholy sits on brood,\nAnd I do doubt the hatch and the disclose\nWill be some danger, which for to prevent,\nI have in quick determination\nThus set it down: he shall with speed to England\nFor the demand of our neglected tribute:\nHaply the seas and countries different,\nWith variable objects, shall expel\nThis something settled matter in his heart,\nWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus\nFrom fashion of himself. What think you on’t?\nPOLONIUS.\nIt shall do well. But yet do I believe\nThe origin and commencement of his grief\nSprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia?\nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said,\nWe heard it all. My lord, do as you please,\nBut if you hold it fit, after the play,\nLet his queen mother all alone entreat him\nTo show his grief, let her be round with him,\nAnd I’ll be plac’d, so please you, in the ear\nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\nTo England send him; or confine him where\nYour wisdom best shall think.\nKING.\nIt shall be so.\nMadness in great ones must not unwatch’d go.\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. A hall in the Castle.\nEnter Hamlet and certain Players.\n\nHAMLET.\nSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.\n\nFIRST PLAYER.\nI warrant your honour.\nHAMLET.\nBe not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.\n\nFIRST PLAYER.\nI hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.\nHAMLET.\nO reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That’s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.\n\n[Exeunt Players.]\n\nEnter Polonius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\nHow now, my lord?\nWill the King hear this piece of work?\n\nPOLONIUS.\nAnd the Queen too, and that presently.\nHAMLET.\nBid the players make haste.\n[Exit Polonius.]\n\nWill you two help to hasten them?\n\nROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\nWe will, my lord.\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\n\nHAMLET.\nWhat ho, Horatio!\nEnter Horatio.\n\nHORATIO.\nHere, sweet lord, at your service.\nHAMLET.\nHoratio, thou art e’en as just a man\nAs e’er my conversation cop’d withal.\nHORATIO.\nO my dear lord.\nHAMLET.\nNay, do not think I flatter;\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee,\nThat no revenue hast, but thy good spirits\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter’d?\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice,\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\nHath seal’d thee for herself. For thou hast been\nAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,\nA man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards\nHast ta’en with equal thanks. And bles’d are those\nWhose blood and judgment are so well co-mingled\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\nThat is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him\nIn my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,\nAs I do thee. Something too much of this.\nThere is a play tonight before the King.\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance\nWhich I have told thee, of my father’s death.\nI prythee, when thou see’st that act a-foot,\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\nObserve mine uncle. If his occulted guilt\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen;\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\nAs Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note;\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face;\nAnd after we will both our judgments join\nIn censure of his seeming.\nHORATIO.\nWell, my lord.\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,\nAnd scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\nHAMLET.\nThey are coming to the play. I must be idle.\nGet you a place.\nDanish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and others.\n\nKING.\nHow fares our cousin Hamlet?\nHAMLET.\nExcellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.\n\nKING.\nI have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.\n\nHAMLET.\nNo, nor mine now. [To Polonius.] My lord, you play’d once i’ th’university, you say?\n\nPOLONIUS.\nThat did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.\nHAMLET.\nWhat did you enact?\nPOLONIUS.\nI did enact Julius Caesar. I was kill’d i’ th’ Capitol. Brutus killed me.\n\nHAMLET.\nIt was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nAy, my lord; they stay upon your patience.\nQUEEN.\nCome hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.\nHAMLET.\nNo, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.\nPOLONIUS.\n[To the King.] O ho! do you mark that?\nHAMLET.\nLady, shall I lie in your lap?\n[Lying down at Ophelia’s feet.]\n\nOPHELIA.\nNo, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI mean, my head upon your lap?\nOPHELIA.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nDo you think I meant country matters?\nOPHELIA.\nI think nothing, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThat’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.\nOPHELIA.\nWhat is, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nNothing.\nOPHELIA.\nYou are merry, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWho, I?\nOPHELIA.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nO God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within’s two hours.\n\nOPHELIA.\nNay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nSo long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year. But by’r lady, he must build churches then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is ‘For, O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!’\n\nTrumpets sound. The dumb show enters.\n\nEnter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King’s ears, and exits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nOPHELIA.\nWhat means this, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nMarry, this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.\nOPHELIA.\nBelike this show imports the argument of the play.\nEnter Prologue.\n\nHAMLET.\nWe shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.\n\nOPHELIA.\nWill they tell us what this show meant?\nHAMLET.\nAy, or any show that you’ll show him. Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.\n\nOPHELIA.\nYou are naught, you are naught: I’ll mark the play.\nPROLOGUE.\n   For us, and for our tragedy,\n   Here stooping to your clemency,\n   We beg your hearing patiently.\nHAMLET.\nIs this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?\nOPHELIA.\n’Tis brief, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nAs woman’s love.\nEnter a King and a Queen.\n\nPLAYER KING.\nFull thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round\nNeptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbed ground,\nAnd thirty dozen moons with borrow’d sheen\nAbout the world have times twelve thirties been,\nSince love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands\nUnite commutual in most sacred bands.\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nSo many journeys may the sun and moon\nMake us again count o’er ere love be done.\nBut, woe is me, you are so sick of late,\nSo far from cheer and from your former state,\nThat I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,\nDiscomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:\nFor women’s fear and love holds quantity,\nIn neither aught, or in extremity.\nNow what my love is, proof hath made you know,\nAnd as my love is siz’d, my fear is so.\nWhere love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;\nWhere little fears grow great, great love grows there.\nPLAYER KING.\nFaith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too:\nMy operant powers their functions leave to do:\nAnd thou shalt live in this fair world behind,\nHonour’d, belov’d, and haply one as kind\nFor husband shalt thou—\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nO confound the rest.\nSuch love must needs be treason in my breast.\nIn second husband let me be accurst!\nNone wed the second but who kill’d the first.\nHAMLET.\n[Aside.] Wormwood, wormwood.\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nThe instances that second marriage move\nAre base respects of thrift, but none of love.\nA second time I kill my husband dead,\nWhen second husband kisses me in bed.\nPLAYER KING.\nI do believe you think what now you speak;\nBut what we do determine, oft we break.\nPurpose is but the slave to memory,\nOf violent birth, but poor validity:\nWhich now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,\nBut fall unshaken when they mellow be.\nMost necessary ’tis that we forget\nTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.\nWhat to ourselves in passion we propose,\nThe passion ending, doth the purpose lose.\nThe violence of either grief or joy\nTheir own enactures with themselves destroy.\nWhere joy most revels, grief doth most lament;\nGrief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.\nThis world is not for aye; nor ’tis not strange\nThat even our loves should with our fortunes change,\nFor ’tis a question left us yet to prove,\nWhether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.\nThe great man down, you mark his favourite flies,\nThe poor advanc’d makes friends of enemies;\nAnd hitherto doth love on fortune tend:\nFor who not needs shall never lack a friend,\nAnd who in want a hollow friend doth try,\nDirectly seasons him his enemy.\nBut orderly to end where I begun,\nOur wills and fates do so contrary run\nThat our devices still are overthrown.\nOur thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.\nSo think thou wilt no second husband wed,\nBut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nNor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,\nSport and repose lock from me day and night,\nTo desperation turn my trust and hope,\nAn anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope,\nEach opposite that blanks the face of joy,\nMeet what I would have well, and it destroy!\nBoth here and hence pursue me lasting strife,\nIf, once a widow, ever I be wife.\nHAMLET.\n[To Ophelia.] If she should break it now.\nPLAYER KING.\n’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.\nMy spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile\nThe tedious day with sleep.\n[Sleeps.]\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nSleep rock thy brain,\nAnd never come mischance between us twain.\n[Exit.]\n\nHAMLET.\nMadam, how like you this play?\nQUEEN.\nThe lady protests too much, methinks.\nHAMLET.\nO, but she’ll keep her word.\nKING.\nHave you heard the argument? Is there no offence in’t?\nHAMLET.\nNo, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’ world.\n\nKING.\nWhat do you call the play?\nHAMLET.\nThe Mousetrap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke’s name, his wife Baptista: you shall see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of work: but what o’ that? Your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the gall’d jade wince; our withers are unwrung.\n\nEnter Lucianus.\n\nThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.\n\nOPHELIA.\nYou are a good chorus, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.\n\nOPHELIA.\nYou are keen, my lord, you are keen.\nHAMLET.\nIt would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.\nOPHELIA.\nStill better, and worse.\nHAMLET.\nSo you mistake your husbands.—Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.\n\nLUCIANUS.\nThoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,\nConfederate season, else no creature seeing;\nThou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,\nWith Hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,\nThy natural magic and dire property\nOn wholesome life usurp immediately.\n[Pours the poison into the sleeper’s ears.]\n\nHAMLET.\nHe poisons him i’ th’garden for’s estate. His name’s Gonzago. The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.\n\nOPHELIA.\nThe King rises.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, frighted with false fire?\nQUEEN.\nHow fares my lord?\nPOLONIUS.\nGive o’er the play.\nKING.\nGive me some light. Away.\nAll.\nLights, lights, lights.\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.]\n\nHAMLET.\n   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,\n     The hart ungalled play;\n   For some must watch, while some must sleep,\n     So runs the world away.\nWould not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me; with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?\n\nHORATIO.\nHalf a share.\nHAMLET.\nA whole one, I.\n   For thou dost know, O Damon dear,\n     This realm dismantled was\n   Of Jove himself, and now reigns here\n     A very, very—pajock.\nHORATIO.\nYou might have rhymed.\nHAMLET.\nO good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?\n\nHORATIO.\nVery well, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nUpon the talk of the poisoning?\nHORATIO.\nI did very well note him.\nHAMLET.\nAh, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders.\n   For if the king like not the comedy,\n   Why then, belike he likes it not, perdie.\nCome, some music.\nEnter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nGood my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.\nHAMLET.\nSir, a whole history.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nThe King, sir—\nHAMLET.\nAy, sir, what of him?\nGUILDENSTERN.\nIs in his retirement, marvellous distempered.\nHAMLET.\nWith drink, sir?\nGUILDENSTERN.\nNo, my lord; rather with choler.\nHAMLET.\nYour wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nGood my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.\n\nHAMLET.\nI am tame, sir, pronounce.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nThe Queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.\n\nHAMLET.\nYou are welcome.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nNay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.\n\nHAMLET.\nSir, I cannot.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nWhat, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nMake you a wholesome answer. My wit’s diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter. My mother, you say,—\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nThen thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.\n\nHAMLET.\nO wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nShe desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.\nHAMLET.\nWe shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?\n\nROSENCRANTZ.\nMy lord, you once did love me.\nHAMLET.\nAnd so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nGood my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.\n\nHAMLET.\nSir, I lack advancement.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nHow can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark?\n\nHAMLET.\nAy, sir, but while the grass grows—the proverb is something musty.\n\nRe-enter the Players with recorders.\n\nO, the recorders. Let me see one.—To withdraw with you, why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nO my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.\nHAMLET.\nI do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?\nGUILDENSTERN.\nMy lord, I cannot.\nHAMLET.\nI pray you.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nBelieve me, I cannot.\nHAMLET.\nI do beseech you.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nI know no touch of it, my lord.\nHAMLET.\n’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.\n\nGUILDENSTERN.\nBut these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony. I have not the skill.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.\n\nEnter Polonius.\n\nGod bless you, sir.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.\nHAMLET.\nDo you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?\nPOLONIUS.\nBy the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.\nHAMLET.\nMethinks it is like a weasel.\nPOLONIUS.\nIt is backed like a weasel.\nHAMLET.\nOr like a whale.\nPOLONIUS.\nVery like a whale.\nHAMLET.\nThen will I come to my mother by and by.—They fool me to the top of my bent.—I will come by and by.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nI will say so.\n[Exit.]\n\nHAMLET.\nBy and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.\n\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]\n\n’Tis now the very witching time of night,\nWhen churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out\nContagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,\nAnd do such bitter business as the day\nWould quake to look on. Soft now, to my mother.\nO heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever\nThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:\nLet me be cruel, not unnatural.\nI will speak daggers to her, but use none;\nMy tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.\nHow in my words somever she be shent,\nTo give them seals never, my soul, consent.\n[Exit.]\n",

    "content":"SCENE III. A room in the Castle.\nEnter King, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\nKING.\nI like him not, nor stands it safe with us\nTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you,\nI your commission will forthwith dispatch,\nAnd he to England shall along with you.\nThe terms of our estate may not endure\nHazard so near us as doth hourly grow\nOut of his lunacies.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nWe will ourselves provide.\nMost holy and religious fear it is\nTo keep those many many bodies safe\nThat live and feed upon your Majesty.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nThe single and peculiar life is bound\nWith all the strength and armour of the mind,\nTo keep itself from ’noyance; but much more\nThat spirit upon whose weal depend and rest\nThe lives of many. The cease of majesty\nDies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw\nWhat’s near it with it. It is a massy wheel\nFix’d on the summit of the highest mount,\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\nAre mortis’d and adjoin’d; which when it falls,\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\nAttends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone\nDid the King sigh, but with a general groan.\nKING.\nArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;\nFor we will fetters put upon this fear,\nWhich now goes too free-footed.\nROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\nWe will haste us.\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\n\nEnter Polonius.\n\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.\nBehind the arras I’ll convey myself\nTo hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home,\nAnd as you said, and wisely was it said,\n’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,\nSince nature makes them partial, should o’erhear\nThe speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege,\nI’ll call upon you ere you go to bed,\nAnd tell you what I know.\nKING.\nThanks, dear my lord.\n[Exit Polonius.]\n\nO, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;\nIt hath the primal eldest curse upon’t,—\nA brother’s murder! Pray can I not,\nThough inclination be as sharp as will:\nMy stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,\nAnd, like a man to double business bound,\nI stand in pause where I shall first begin,\nAnd both neglect. What if this cursed hand\nWere thicker than itself with brother’s blood,\nIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens\nTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy\nBut to confront the visage of offence?\nAnd what’s in prayer but this twofold force,\nTo be forestalled ere we come to fall,\nOr pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up.\nMy fault is past. But O, what form of prayer\nCan serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!\nThat cannot be; since I am still possess’d\nOf those effects for which I did the murder,—\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\nMay one be pardon’d and retain th’offence?\nIn the corrupted currents of this world\nOffence’s gilded hand may shove by justice,\nAnd oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself\nBuys out the law. But ’tis not so above;\nThere is no shuffling, there the action lies\nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\nTo give in evidence. What then? What rests?\nTry what repentance can. What can it not?\nYet what can it, when one cannot repent?\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\nO limed soul, that struggling to be free,\nArt more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay:\nBow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,\nBe soft as sinews of the new-born babe.\nAll may be well.\n[Retires and kneels.]\n\nEnter Hamlet.\n\nHAMLET.\nNow might I do it pat, now he is praying.\nAnd now I’ll do’t. And so he goes to heaven;\nAnd so am I reveng’d. That would be scann’d:\nA villain kills my father, and for that\nI, his sole son, do this same villain send\nTo heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\nAnd how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought,\n’Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng’d,\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\nWhen he is fit and season’d for his passage? No.\nUp, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:\nWhen he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,\nOr in th’incestuous pleasure of his bed,\nAt gaming, swearing; or about some act\nThat has no relish of salvation in’t,\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\nAnd that his soul may be as damn’d and black\nAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.\nThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days.\n[Exit.]\n\nThe King rises and advances.\n\nKING.\nMy words fly up, my thoughts remain below.\nWords without thoughts never to heaven go.\n[Exit.]",

I’ll silence me e’en here.\nPray you be round with him.\nHAMLET.\n[Within.] Mother, mother, mother.\nQUEEN.\nI’ll warrant you, Fear me not.\nWithdraw, I hear him coming.\n\n[Polonius goes behind the arras.]\n\nEnter Hamlet.\n\nHAMLET.\nNow, mother, what’s the matter?\nQUEEN.\nHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.\nHAMLET.\nMother, you have my father much offended.\nQUEEN.\nCome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.\nHAMLET.\nGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.\nQUEEN.\nWhy, how now, Hamlet?\nHAMLET.\nWhat’s the matter now?\nQUEEN.\nHave you forgot me?\nHAMLET.\nNo, by the rood, not so.\nYou are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,\nAnd, would it were not so. You are my mother.\nQUEEN.\nNay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.\nHAMLET.\nCome, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\nQUEEN.\nWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?\nHelp, help, ho!\nPOLONIUS.\n[Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!\nHAMLET.\nHow now? A rat? [Draws.]\nDead for a ducat, dead!\n[Makes a pass through the arras.]\n\nPOLONIUS.\n[Behind.] O, I am slain!\n[Falls and dies.]\n\nQUEEN.\nO me, what hast thou done?\nHAMLET.\nNay, I know not. Is it the King?\n[Draws forth Polonius.]\n\nQUEEN.\nO what a rash and bloody deed is this!\nHAMLET.\nA bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\nQUEEN.\nAs kill a king?\nHAMLET.\nAy, lady, ’twas my word.—\n[To Polonius.] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!\nI took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,\nThou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—\nLeave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,\nAnd let me wring your heart, for so I shall,\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff;\nIf damned custom have not braz’d it so,\nThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.\nQUEEN.\nWhat have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue\nIn noise so rude against me?\nHAMLET.\nSuch an act\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,\nAnd sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows\nAs false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\nA rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,\nYea this solidity and compound mass,\nWith tristful visage, as against the doom,\nIs thought-sick at the act.\nQUEEN.\nAy me, what act,\nThat roars so loud, and thunders in the index?\nHAMLET.\nLook here upon this picture, and on this,\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow,\nHyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,\nAn eye like Mars, to threaten and command,\nA station like the herald Mercury\nNew lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:\nA combination and a form indeed,\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal,\nTo give the world assurance of a man.\nThis was your husband. Look you now what follows.\nHere is your husband, like a mildew’d ear\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed,\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?\nYou cannot call it love; for at your age\nThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,\nAnd waits upon the judgment: and what judgment\nWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,\nElse could you not have motion; but sure that sense\nIs apoplex’d, for madness would not err\nNor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d\nBut it reserv’d some quantity of choice\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was’t\nThat thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\nCould not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?\nRebellious hell,\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax,\nAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\nWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\nAnd reason panders will.\nQUEEN.\nO Hamlet, speak no more.\nThou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\nAs will not leave their tinct.\nHAMLET.\nNay, but to live\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\nStew’d in corruption, honeying and making love\nOver the nasty sty.\nQUEEN.\nO speak to me no more;\nThese words like daggers enter in mine ears;\nNo more, sweet Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nA murderer and a villain;\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\nOf your precedent lord. A vice of kings,\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\nAnd put it in his pocket!\nQUEEN.\nNo more.\nHAMLET.\nA king of shreds and patches!—\nEnter Ghost.\n\nSave me and hover o’er me with your wings,\nYou heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?\nQUEEN.\nAlas, he’s mad.\nHAMLET.\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\nThat, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by\nThe important acting of your dread command?\nO say!\nGHOST.\nDo not forget. This visitation\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\nBut look, amazement on thy mother sits.\nO step between her and her fighting soul.\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works.\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nHow is it with you, lady?\nQUEEN.\nAlas, how is’t with you,\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy,\nAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,\nYour bedded hairs, like life in excrements,\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\nSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?\nHAMLET.\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,\nHis form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,\nWould make them capable.—Do not look upon me,\nLest with this piteous action you convert\nMy stern effects. Then what I have to do\nWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\nQUEEN.\nTo whom do you speak this?\nHAMLET.\nDo you see nothing there?\nQUEEN.\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\nHAMLET.\nNor did you nothing hear?\nQUEEN.\nNo, nothing but ourselves.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, look you there! look how it steals away!\nMy father, in his habit as he liv’d!\nLook where he goes even now out at the portal.\n[Exit Ghost.]\n\nQUEEN.\nThis is the very coinage of your brain.\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\nIs very cunning in.\nHAMLET.\nEcstasy!\nMy pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,\nAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madness\nThat I have utter’d. Bring me to the test,\nAnd I the matter will re-word; which madness\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\nThat not your trespass, but my madness speaks.\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\nWhilst rank corruption, mining all within,\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,\nRepent what’s past, avoid what is to come;\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds,\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;\nFor in the fatness of these pursy times\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\nQUEEN.\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.\nHAMLET.\nO throw away the worser part of it,\nAnd live the purer with the other half.\nGood night. But go not to mine uncle’s bed.\nAssume a virtue, if you have it not.\nThat monster custom, who all sense doth eat,\nOf habits evil, is angel yet in this,\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\nTo the next abstinence. The next more easy;\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature,\nAnd either curb the devil, or throw him out\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,\nAnd when you are desirous to be bles’d,\nI’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord\n[Pointing to Polonius.]\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleas’d it so,\nTo punish me with this, and this with me,\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\nI will bestow him, and will answer well\nThe death I gave him. So again, good night.\nI must be cruel, only to be kind:\nThus bad begins, and worse remains behind.\nOne word more, good lady.\nQUEEN.\nWhat shall I do?\nHAMLET.\nNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:\nLet the bloat King tempt you again to bed,\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,\nOr paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers,\nMake you to ravel all this matter out,\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\nBut mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know,\nFor who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\nSuch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\nUnpeg the basket on the house’s top,\nLet the birds fly, and like the famous ape,\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\nAnd break your own neck down.\nQUEEN.\nBe thou assur’d, if words be made of breath,\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\nWhat thou hast said to me.\nHAMLET.\nI must to England, you know that?\nQUEEN.\nAlack,\nI had forgot. ’Tis so concluded on.\nHAMLET.\nThere’s letters seal’d: and my two schoolfellows,\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fang’d,—\nThey bear the mandate, they must sweep my way\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work;\nFor ’tis the sport to have the enginer\nHoist with his own petard, and ’t shall go hard\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\nAnd blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet,\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.\nThis man shall set me packing.\nI’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.\nMother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\nWho was in life a foolish prating knave.\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you.\nGood night, mother.\n[Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius.]",

God be at your table!\n\nKING.\nConceit upon her father.\nOPHELIA.\nPray you, let’s have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:\n[Sings.]\n   Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,\n     All in the morning betime,\n   And I a maid at your window,\n     To be your Valentine.\n   Then up he rose and donn’d his clothes,\n     And dupp’d the chamber door,\n   Let in the maid, that out a maid\n     Never departed more.\nKING.\nPretty Ophelia!\nOPHELIA.\nIndeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t.\n[Sings.]\n   By Gis and by Saint Charity,\n     Alack, and fie for shame!\n   Young men will do’t if they come to’t;\n     By Cock, they are to blame.\n   Quoth she, before you tumbled me,\n     You promis’d me to wed.\n   So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,\n     An thou hadst not come to my bed.\nKING.\nHow long hath she been thus?\nOPHELIA.\nI hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but weep, to think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nKING.\nFollow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.\n[Exit Horatio.]\n\nO, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs\nAll from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,\nWhen sorrows come, they come not single spies,\nBut in battalions. First, her father slain;\nNext, your son gone; and he most violent author\nOf his own just remove; the people muddied,\nThick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers\nFor good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly\nIn hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia\nDivided from herself and her fair judgment,\nWithout the which we are pictures or mere beasts.\nLast, and as much containing as all these,\nHer brother is in secret come from France,\nFeeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,\nAnd wants not buzzers to infect his ear\nWith pestilent speeches of his father’s death,\nWherein necessity, of matter beggar’d,\nWill nothing stick our person to arraign\nIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,\nLike to a murdering piece, in many places\nGives me superfluous death.\n[A noise within.]\n\nQUEEN.\nAlack, what noise is this?\nKING.\nWhere are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.\n\nEnter a Gentleman.\n\nWhat is the matter?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nSave yourself, my lord.\nThe ocean, overpeering of his list,\nEats not the flats with more impetuous haste\nThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,\nO’erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord,\nAnd, as the world were now but to begin,\nAntiquity forgot, custom not known,\nThe ratifiers and props of every word,\nThey cry ‘Choose we! Laertes shall be king!’\nCaps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,\n‘Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.’\nQUEEN.\nHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry.\nO, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.\n[A noise within.]\n\nKING.\nThe doors are broke.\nEnter Laertes, armed; Danes following.\n\nLAERTES.\nWhere is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.\nDanes.\nNo, let’s come in.\nLAERTES.\nI pray you, give me leave.\nDANES.\nWe will, we will.\n[They retire without the door.]\n\nLAERTES.\nI thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king,\nGive me my father.\nQUEEN.\nCalmly, good Laertes.\nLAERTES.\nThat drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard;\nCries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot\nEven here between the chaste unsmirched brow\nOf my true mother.\nKING.\nWhat is the cause, Laertes,\nThat thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—\nLet him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.\nThere’s such divinity doth hedge a king,\nThat treason can but peep to what it would,\nActs little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes,\nWhy thou art thus incens’d.—Let him go, Gertrude:—\nSpeak, man.\nLAERTES.\nWhere is my father?\nKING.\nDead.\nQUEEN.\nBut not by him.\nKING.\nLet him demand his fill.\nLAERTES.\nHow came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.\nTo hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!\nConscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!\nI dare damnation. To this point I stand,\nThat both the worlds, I give to negligence,\nLet come what comes; only I’ll be reveng’d\nMost throughly for my father.\nKING.\nWho shall stay you?\nLAERTES.\nMy will, not all the world.\nAnd for my means, I’ll husband them so well,\nThey shall go far with little.\nKING.\nGood Laertes,\nIf you desire to know the certainty\nOf your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge\nThat, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,\nWinner and loser?\nLAERTES.\nNone but his enemies.\nKING.\nWill you know them then?\nLAERTES.\nTo his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms;\nAnd, like the kind life-rendering pelican,\nRepast them with my blood.\nKING.\nWhy, now you speak\nLike a good child and a true gentleman.\nThat I am guiltless of your father’s death,\nAnd am most sensibly in grief for it,\nIt shall as level to your judgment ’pear\nAs day does to your eye.\nDANES.\n[Within.] Let her come in.\nLAERTES.\nHow now! What noise is that?\nRe-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.\n\nO heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,\nBurn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.\nBy heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,\nTill our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!\nDear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!\nO heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits\nShould be as mortal as an old man’s life?\nNature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine,\nIt sends some precious instance of itself\nAfter the thing it loves.\nOPHELIA.\n[Sings.]\n   They bore him barefac’d on the bier,\n   Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny\n   And on his grave rain’d many a tear.—\n   Fare you well, my dove!\n\nLAERTES.\nHadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,\nIt could not move thus.\nOPHELIA.\nYou must sing ‘Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.’ O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter.\n\nLAERTES.\nThis nothing’s more than matter.\nOPHELIA.\nThere’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray love, remember. And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.\n\nLAERTES.\nA document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.\nOPHELIA.\nThere’s fennel for you, and columbines. There’s rue for you; and here’s some for me. We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O you must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither’d all when my father died. They say he made a good end.\n[Sings.]\n   For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.\n\nLAERTES.\nThought and affliction, passion, hell itself\nShe turns to favour and to prettiness.\nOPHELIA.\n[Sings.]\n   And will he not come again?\n   And will he not come again?\n     No, no, he is dead,\n     Go to thy death-bed,\n   He never will come again.\n   His beard was as white as snow,\n   All flaxen was his poll.\n     He is gone, he is gone,\n     And we cast away moan.\n   God ha’ mercy on his soul.\nAnd of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b’ wi’ ye.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nLAERTES.\nDo you see this, O God?\nKING.\nLaertes, I must commune with your grief,\nOr you deny me right. Go but apart,\nMake choice of whom your wisest friends you will,\nAnd they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.\nIf by direct or by collateral hand\nThey find us touch’d, we will our kingdom give,\nOur crown, our life, and all that we call ours\nTo you in satisfaction; but if not,\nBe you content to lend your patience to us,\nAnd we shall jointly labour with your soul\nTo give it due content.\nLAERTES.\nLet this be so;\nHis means of death, his obscure burial,—\nNo trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,\nNo noble rite, nor formal ostentation,—\nCry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth,\nThat I must call’t in question.\nKING.\nSo you shall.\nAnd where th’offence is let the great axe fall.\nI pray you go with me.\n[Exeunt.]",

Another room in the Castle.\nEnter King and Laertes.\n\nKING.\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\nPursu’d my life.\nLAERTES.\nIt well appears. But tell me\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\nSo crimeful and so capital in nature,\nAs by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\nYou mainly were stirr’d up.\nKING.\nO, for two special reasons,\nWhich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d,\nBut yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother\nLives almost by his looks; and for myself,—\nMy virtue or my plague, be it either which,—\nShe’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\nI could not but by her. The other motive,\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\nWould like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\nConvert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\nToo slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\nAnd not where I had aim’d them.\nLAERTES.\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\nA sister driven into desperate terms,\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\nKING.\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\nI lov’d your father, and we love ourself,\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nHow now? What news?\n\nMESSENGER.\nLetters, my lord, from Hamlet.\nThis to your Majesty; this to the Queen.\nKING.\nFrom Hamlet! Who brought them?\nMESSENGER.\nSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.\nThey were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them\nOf him that brought them.\nKING.\nLaertes, you shall hear them.\nLeave us.\n[Exit Messenger.]\n\n[Reads.] ‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return.\n     HAMLET.’\n\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\nOr is it some abuse, and no such thing?\nLAERTES.\nKnow you the hand?\nKING.\n’Tis Hamlet’s character. ‘Naked!’\nAnd in a postscript here he says ‘alone.’\nCan you advise me?\nLAERTES.\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth,\n‘Thus diest thou.’\nKING.\nIf it be so, Laertes,—\nAs how should it be so? How otherwise?—\nWill you be rul’d by me?\nLAERTES.\nAy, my lord;\nSo you will not o’errule me to a peace.\nKING.\nTo thine own peace. If he be now return’d,\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\nTo exploit, now ripe in my device,\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\nAnd for his death no wind shall breathe,\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\nAnd call it accident.\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I will be rul’d;\nThe rather if you could devise it so\nThat I might be the organ.\nKING.\nIt falls right.\nYou have been talk’d of since your travel much,\nAnd that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\nOf the unworthiest siege.\nLAERTES.\nWhat part is that, my lord?\nKING.\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy,—\nI’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French,\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\nHad witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat,\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\nAs had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d\nWith the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks,\nCome short of what he did.\nLAERTES.\nA Norman was’t?\nKING.\nA Norman.\nLAERTES.\nUpon my life, Lamond.\nKING.\nThe very same.\nLAERTES.\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\nAnd gem of all the nation.\nKING.\nHe made confession of you,\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\nFor art and exercise in your defence,\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\nThat he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed\nIf one could match you. The scrimers of their nation\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\nIf you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\nYour sudden coming o’er to play with him.\nNow, out of this,—\nLAERTES.\nWhat out of this, my lord?\nKING.\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\nA face without a heart?\nLAERTES.\nWhy ask you this?\nKING.\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\nThere lives within the very flame of love\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still,\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\nDies in his own too much. That we would do,\nWe should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes,\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\nAnd then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o’ th’ulcer:\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\nTo show yourself your father’s son in deed,\nMore than in words?\nLAERTES.\nTo cut his throat i’ th’ church.\nKING.\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\nRevenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\nHamlet return’d shall know you are come home:\nWe’ll put on those shall praise your excellence,\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\nWill not peruse the foils; so that with ease,\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,\nRequite him for your father.\nLAERTES.\nI will do’t.\nAnd for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\nThis is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point\nWith this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\nIt may be death.\nKING.\nLet’s further think of this,\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance.\n’Twere better not assay’d. Therefore this project\nShould have a back or second, that might hold\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\nWe’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,—\nI ha’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end,\nAnd that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him\nA chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\nIf he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,\nOur purpose may hold there.\nEnter Queen.\n\nHow now, sweet Queen?\n\nQUEEN.\nOne woe doth tread upon another’s heel,\nSo fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.\nLAERTES.\nDrown’d! O, where?\nQUEEN.\nThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,\nThat shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.\nThere with fantastic garlands did she make\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\nBut our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them.\nThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\nClamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\nAnd mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,\nWhich time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\nOr like a creature native and indued\nUnto that element. But long it could not be\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\nPull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay\nTo muddy death.\nLAERTES.\nAlas, then she is drown’d?\nQUEEN.\nDrown’d, drown’d.\nLAERTES.\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears. But yet\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\nLet shame say what it will. When these are gone,\nThe woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,\nI have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,\nBut that this folly douts it.\n[Exit.]\n\nKING.\nLet’s follow, Gertrude;\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\nNow fear I this will give it start again;\nTherefore let’s follow.\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT V\nSCENE I. A churchyard.\nEnter two Clowns with spades, &c.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nIs she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nI tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nHow can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWhy, ’tis found so.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nIt must be se offendendo, it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nNay, but hear you, goodman delver,—\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nGive me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes,—mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nBut is this law?\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nAy, marry, is’t, crowner’s quest law.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWill you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, there thou say’st. And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWas he a gentleman?\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nHe was the first that ever bore arms.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWhy, he had none.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digg’d. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nGo to.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhat is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nThe gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nI like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To’t again, come.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWho builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nAy, tell me that, and unyoke.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nMarry, now I can tell.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nTo’t.\n\nSECOND CLOWN.\nMass, I cannot tell.\n\nEnter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nCudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say ‘a grave-maker’. The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.\n\n[Exit Second Clown.]\n\n[Digs and sings.]\n\n   In youth when I did love, did love,\n     Methought it was very sweet;\n   To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,\n     O methought there was nothing meet.\nHAMLET.\nHas this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?\n\nHORATIO.\nCustom hath made it in him a property of easiness.\nHAMLET.\n’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\n[Sings.]\n   But age with his stealing steps\n     Hath claw’d me in his clutch,\n   And hath shipp’d me into the land,\n     As if I had never been such.\n[Throws up a skull.]\n\nHAMLET.\nThat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to th’ ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?\n\nHORATIO.\nIt might, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nOr of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?’ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?\n\nHORATIO.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with ’em? Mine ache to think on’t.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\n[Sings.]\n   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,\n     For and a shrouding-sheet;\n   O, a pit of clay for to be made\n     For such a guest is meet.\n[Throws up another skull.]\n\nHAMLET.\nThere’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum. This fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?\n\nHORATIO.\nNot a jot more, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nIs not parchment made of sheep-skins?\nHORATIO.\nAy, my lord, and of calf-skins too.\nHAMLET.\nThey are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sir?\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nMine, sir.\n[Sings.]\n   O, a pit of clay for to be made\n     For such a guest is meet.\nHAMLET.\nI think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nYou lie out on’t, sir, and therefore ’tis not yours.\nFor my part, I do not lie in’t, yet it is mine.\nHAMLET.\nThou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\n’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’t will away again from me to you.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhat man dost thou dig it for?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFor no man, sir.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhat woman then?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFor none neither.\n\nHAMLET.\nWho is to be buried in’t?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nOne that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?\n\nFIRST CLOWN.\nOf all the days i’ th’ year, I came to’t that day that our last King Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow long is that since?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nCannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into England.\n\nHAMLET.\nAy, marry, why was he sent into England?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he do not, it’s no great matter there.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhy?\nFIRST CLOWN.\n’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow came he mad?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nVery strangely, they say.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow strangely?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFaith, e’en with losing his wits.\n\nHAMLET.\nUpon what ground?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow long will a man lie i’ th’earth ere he rot?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFaith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhy he more than another?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out water a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhose was it?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nA whoreson, mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?\n\nHAMLET.\nNay, I know not.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nA pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour’d a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester.\n\nHAMLET.\nThis?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nE’en that.\n\nHAMLET.\nLet me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prythee, Horatio, tell me one thing.\n\nHORATIO.\nWhat’s that, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nDost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?\nHORATIO.\nE’en so.\nHAMLET.\nAnd smelt so? Pah!\n[Throws down the skull.]\n\nHORATIO.\nE’en so, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?\n\nHORATIO.\n’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.\nHAMLET.\nNo, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?\nImperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,\nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away.\nO, that that earth which kept the world in awe\nShould patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw.\nBut soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.\nEnter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.\n\nThe Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken\nThe corse they follow did with desperate hand\nFordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate.\nCouch we awhile and mark.\n[Retiring with Horatio.]\n\nLAERTES.\nWhat ceremony else?\nHAMLET.\nThat is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.\n\nLAERTES.\nWhat ceremony else?\nPRIEST.\nHer obsequies have been as far enlarg’d\nAs we have warranties. Her death was doubtful;\nAnd but that great command o’ersways the order,\nShe should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d\nTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,\nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.\nYet here she is allowed her virgin rites,\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home\nOf bell and burial.\nLAERTES.\nMust there no more be done?\nPRIEST.\nNo more be done.\nWe should profane the service of the dead\nTo sing sage requiem and such rest to her\nAs to peace-parted souls.\nLAERTES.\nLay her i’ th’earth,\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\nMay violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest,\nA minist’ring angel shall my sister be\nWhen thou liest howling.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, the fair Ophelia?\nQUEEN.\n[Scattering flowers.] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.\nI hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;\nI thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,\nAnd not have strew’d thy grave.\nLAERTES.\nO, treble woe\nFall ten times treble on that cursed head\nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense\nDepriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth a while,\nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.\n[Leaps into the grave.]\nNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,\nTill of this flat a mountain you have made,\nTo o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head\nOf blue Olympus.\nHAMLET.\n[Advancing.]\nWhat is he whose grief\nBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow\nConjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\nHamlet the Dane.\n[Leaps into the grave.]\nLAERTES.\n[Grappling with him.] The devil take thy soul!\n\nHAMLET.\nThou pray’st not well.\nI prythee take thy fingers from my throat;\nFor though I am not splenative and rash,\nYet have I in me something dangerous,\nWhich let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!\nKING.\nPluck them asunder.\nQUEEN.\nHamlet! Hamlet!\nAll.\nGentlemen!\nHORATIO.\nGood my lord, be quiet.\n[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.]\n\nHAMLET.\nWhy, I will fight with him upon this theme\nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.\nQUEEN.\nO my son, what theme?\nHAMLET.\nI lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers\nCould not, with all their quantity of love,\nMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?\nKING.\nO, he is mad, Laertes.\nQUEEN.\nFor love of God forbear him!\nHAMLET.\n’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do:\nWoul’t weep? woul’t fight? woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself?\nWoul’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?\nI’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine?\nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?\nBe buried quick with her, and so will I.\nAnd if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,\nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,\nMake Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth,\nI’ll rant as well as thou.\nQUEEN.\nThis is mere madness:\nAnd thus awhile the fit will work on him;\nAnon, as patient as the female dove,\nWhen that her golden couplets are disclos’d,\nHis silence will sit drooping.\nHAMLET.\nHear you, sir;\nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?\nI lov’d you ever. But it is no matter.\nLet Hercules himself do what he may,\nThe cat will mew, and dog will have his day.\n[Exit.]\n\nKING.\nI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.\n[Exit Horatio.]\n\n[To Laertes]\nStrengthen your patience in our last night’s speech;\nWe’ll put the matter to the present push.—\nGood Gertrude, set some watch over your son.\nThis grave shall have a living monument.\nAn hour of quiet shortly shall we see;\nTill then in patience our proceeding be.\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. A hall in the Castle.\nEnter Hamlet and Horatio.\n\nHAMLET.\nSo much for this, sir. Now let me see the other;\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\nHORATIO.\nRemember it, my lord!\nHAMLET.\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\nWorse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,\nAnd prais’d be rashness for it,—let us know,\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well,\nWhen our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us\nThere’s a divinity that shapes our ends,\nRough-hew them how we will.\nHORATIO.\nThat is most certain.\nHAMLET.\nUp from my cabin,\nMy sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark\nGrop’d I to find out them; had my desire,\nFinger’d their packet, and in fine, withdrew\nTo mine own room again, making so bold,\nMy fears forgetting manners, to unseal\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\nOh royal knavery! an exact command,\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons,\nImporting Denmark’s health, and England’s too,\nWith ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,\nThat on the supervise, no leisure bated,\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the axe,\nMy head should be struck off.\nHORATIO.\nIs’t possible?\nHAMLET.\nHere’s the commission, read it at more leisure.\nBut wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?\nHORATIO.\nI beseech you.\nHAMLET.\nBeing thus benetted round with villanies,—\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\nThey had begun the play,—I sat me down,\nDevis’d a new commission, wrote it fair:\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\nA baseness to write fair, and labour’d much\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\nIt did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know\nThe effect of what I wrote?\nHORATIO.\nAy, good my lord.\nHAMLET.\nAn earnest conjuration from the King,\nAs England was his faithful tributary,\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish,\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\nAnd stand a comma ’tween their amities,\nAnd many such-like ‘as’es of great charge,\nThat on the view and know of these contents,\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\nHe should the bearers put to sudden death,\nNot shriving-time allow’d.\nHORATIO.\nHow was this seal’d?\nHAMLET.\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\nI had my father’s signet in my purse,\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal:\nFolded the writ up in the form of the other,\nSubscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression; plac’d it safely,\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\nWas our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent\nThou know’st already.\nHORATIO.\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment.\nThey are not near my conscience; their defeat\nDoes by their own insinuation grow.\n’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\nOf mighty opposites.\nHORATIO.\nWhy, what a king is this!\nHAMLET.\nDoes it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,—\nHe that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother,\nPopp’d in between th’election and my hopes,\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\nAnd with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience\nTo quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d\nTo let this canker of our nature come\nIn further evil?\nHORATIO.\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\nHAMLET.\nIt will be short. The interim is mine;\nAnd a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’.\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself;\nFor by the image of my cause I see\nThe portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.\nBut sure the bravery of his grief did put me\nInto a tow’ring passion.\nHORATIO.\nPeace, who comes here?\nEnter Osric.\n\nOSRIC.\nYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.\nHAMLET.\nI humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?\nHORATIO.\nNo, my good lord.\nHAMLET.\nThy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.\n\nOSRIC.\nSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.\n\nHAMLET.\nI will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.\n\nOSRIC.\nI thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.\nHAMLET.\nNo, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.\nOSRIC.\nIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\nHAMLET.\nMethinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.\nOSRIC.\nExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,—\n\nHAMLET.\nI beseech you, remember,—\n\n[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]\n\nOSRIC.\nNay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.\n\nHAMLET.\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.\n\nOSRIC.\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\nHAMLET.\nThe concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?\n\nOSRIC.\nSir?\nHORATIO.\nIs’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\nOSRIC.\nOf Laertes?\nHORATIO.\nHis purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.\nHAMLET.\nOf him, sir.\nOSRIC.\nI know you are not ignorant,—\nHAMLET.\nI would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?\n\nOSRIC.\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—\nHAMLET.\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.\n\nOSRIC.\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them in his meed he’s unfellowed.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhat’s his weapon?\nOSRIC.\nRapier and dagger.\nHAMLET.\nThat’s two of his weapons. But well.\nOSRIC.\nThe King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.\n\nHAMLET.\nWhat call you the carriages?\nHORATIO.\nI knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.\nOSRIC.\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\nHAMLET.\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all imponed, as you call it?\n\nOSRIC.\nThe King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.\n\nHAMLET.\nHow if I answer no?\nOSRIC.\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\nHAMLET.\nSir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\n\nOSRIC.\nShall I re-deliver you e’en so?\nHAMLET.\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\nOSRIC.\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\nHAMLET.\nYours, yours.\n[Exit Osric.]\n\nHe does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s turn.\n\nHORATIO.\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\nHAMLET.\nHe did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out,\n\nEnter a Lord.\n\nLORD.\nMy lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.\n\nHAMLET.\nI am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.\n\nLORD.\nThe King and Queen and all are coming down.\nHAMLET.\nIn happy time.\nLORD.\nThe Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.\n\nHAMLET.\nShe well instructs me.\n[Exit Lord.]\n\nHORATIO.\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.\n\nHORATIO.\nNay, good my lord.\nHAMLET.\nIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.\n\nHORATIO.\nIf your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.\n\nHAMLET.\nNot a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?\n\nEnter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &c.\n\nKING.\nCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.\n[The King puts Laertes’s hand into Hamlet’s.]\n\nHAMLET.\nGive me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;\nBut pardon’t as you are a gentleman.\nThis presence knows, and you must needs have heard,\nHow I am punish’d with sore distraction.\nWhat I have done\nThat might your nature, honour, and exception\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\nWas’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet.\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,\nAnd when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\nWho does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;\nHis madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.\nSir, in this audience,\nLet my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\nThat I have shot my arrow o’er the house\nAnd hurt my brother.\nLAERTES.\nI am satisfied in nature,\nWhose motive in this case should stir me most\nTo my revenge. But in my terms of honour\nI stand aloof, and will no reconcilement\nTill by some elder masters of known honour\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\nTo keep my name ungor’d. But till that time\nI do receive your offer’d love like love,\nAnd will not wrong it.\nHAMLET.\nI embrace it freely,\nAnd will this brother’s wager frankly play.—\nGive us the foils; come on.\nLAERTES.\nCome, one for me.\nHAMLET.\nI’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\nYour skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night,\nStick fiery off indeed.\nLAERTES.\nYou mock me, sir.\nHAMLET.\nNo, by this hand.\nKING.\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\nYou know the wager?\nHAMLET.\nVery well, my lord.\nYour Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.\nKING.\nI do not fear it. I have seen you both;\nBut since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.\nLAERTES.\nThis is too heavy. Let me see another.\nHAMLET.\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\n[They prepare to play.]\n\nOSRIC.\nAy, my good lord.\nKING.\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire;\nThe King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw\nRicher than that which four successive kings\nIn Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups;\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,\n‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin.\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\nHAMLET.\nCome on, sir.\nLAERTES.\nCome, my lord.\n[They play.]\n\nHAMLET.\nOne.\nLAERTES.\nNo.\nHAMLET.\nJudgment.\nOSRIC.\nA hit, a very palpable hit.\nLAERTES.\nWell; again.\nKING.\nStay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;\nHere’s to thy health.\n[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]\n\nGive him the cup.\n\nHAMLET.\nI’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.\n\n[They play.]\n\nCome. Another hit; what say you?\nLAERTES.\nA touch, a touch, I do confess.\nKING.\nOur son shall win.\nQUEEN.\nHe’s fat, and scant of breath.\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.\nThe Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nGood madam.\nKING.\nGertrude, do not drink.\nQUEEN.\nI will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.\nKING.\n[Aside.] It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.\nHAMLET.\nI dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.\nQUEEN.\nCome, let me wipe thy face.\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I’ll hit him now.\nKING.\nI do not think’t.\nLAERTES.\n[Aside.] And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.\nHAMLET.\nCome for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.\nI pray you pass with your best violence.\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\nLAERTES.\nSay you so? Come on.\n[They play.]\n\nOSRIC.\nNothing neither way.\nLAERTES.\nHave at you now.\n[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]\n\nKING.\nPart them; they are incens’d.\nHAMLET.\nNay, come again!\n[The Queen falls.]\n\nOSRIC.\nLook to the Queen there, ho!\nHORATIO.\nThey bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?\nOSRIC.\nHow is’t, Laertes?\nLAERTES.\nWhy, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.\nI am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.\nHAMLET.\nHow does the Queen?\nKING.\nShe swoons to see them bleed.\nQUEEN.\nNo, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!\nThe drink, the drink! I am poison’d.\n[Dies.]\n\nHAMLET.\nO villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d:\nTreachery! Seek it out.\n[Laertes falls.]\n\nLAERTES.\nIt is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.\nNo medicine in the world can do thee good.\nIn thee there is not half an hour of life;\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\nUnbated and envenom’d. The foul practice\nHath turn’d itself on me. Lo, here I lie,\nNever to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d.\nI can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.\nHAMLET.\nThe point envenom’d too!\nThen, venom, to thy work.\n[Stabs the King.]\n\nOSRIC and LORDS.\nTreason! treason!\nKING.\nO yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.\nHAMLET.\nHere, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,\nDrink off this potion. Is thy union here?\nFollow my mother.\n[King dies.]\n\nLAERTES.\nHe is justly serv’d.\nIt is a poison temper’d by himself.\nExchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.\nMine and my father’s death come not upon thee,\nNor thine on me.\n[Dies.]\n\nHAMLET.\nHeaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.\nI am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.\nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,\nHad I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death,\nIs strict in his arrest,—O, I could tell you,—\nBut let it be. Horatio, I am dead,\nThou liv’st; report me and my cause aright\nTo the unsatisfied.\nHORATIO.\nNever believe it.\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane.\nHere’s yet some liquor left.\nHAMLET.\nAs th’art a man,\nGive me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I’ll have’t.\nO good Horatio, what a wounded name,\nThings standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.\nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile,\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,\nTo tell my story.\n[March afar off, and shot within.]\n\nWhat warlike noise is this?\n\nOSRIC.\nYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,\nTo the ambassadors of England gives\nThis warlike volley.\nHAMLET.\nO, I die, Horatio.\nThe potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit:\nI cannot live to hear the news from England,\nBut I do prophesy th’election lights\nOn Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.\nSo tell him, with the occurrents more and less,\nWhich have solicited. The rest is silence.\n[Dies.]\n\nHORATIO.\nNow cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\nWhy does the drum come hither?\n[March within.]\n\nEnter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.\n\nFORTINBRAS.\nWhere is this sight?\nHORATIO.\nWhat is it you would see?\nIf aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\nFORTINBRAS.\nThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell,\nThat thou so many princes at a shot\nSo bloodily hast struck?\nFIRST AMBASSADOR.\nThe sight is dismal;\nAnd our affairs from England come too late.\nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing,\nTo tell him his commandment is fulfill’d,\nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\nWhere should we have our thanks?\nHORATIO.\nNot from his mouth,\nHad it th’ability of life to thank you.\nHe never gave commandment for their death.\nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England\nAre here arriv’d, give order that these bodies\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view,\nAnd let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world\nHow these things came about. So shall you hear\nOf carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,\nOf accidental judgments, casual slaughters,\nOf deaths put on by cunning and forc’d cause,\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook\nFall’n on the inventors’ heads. All this can I\nTruly deliver.\nFORTINBRAS.\nLet us haste to hear it,\nAnd call the noblest to the audience.\nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.\nI have some rights of memory in this kingdom,\nWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me.\nHORATIO.\nOf that I shall have also cause to speak,\nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.\nBut let this same be presently perform’d,\nEven while men’s minds are wild, lest more mischance\nOn plots and errors happen.\nFORTINBRAS.\nLet four captains\nBear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,\nFor he was likely, had he been put on,\nTo have prov’d most royally; and for his passage,\nThe soldiers’ music and the rites of war\nSpeak loudly for him.\nTake up the bodies. Such a sight as this\nBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.\n[A dead march.]\n\n[Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is shot off.]",
