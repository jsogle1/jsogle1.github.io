    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Rome. A street\nEnter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n\nALL.\nSpeak, speak!\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\n\nALL.\nResolved, resolved!\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nFirst, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.\n\nALL.\nWe know’t, we know’t!\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nLet us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price. Is’t a verdict?\n\nALL.\nNo more talking on’t; let it be done. Away, away!\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nOne word, good citizens.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nWe are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely. But they think we are too dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nWould you proceed especially against Caius Martius?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nAgainst him first. He’s a very dog to the commonalty.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nConsider you what services he has done for his country?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nVery well, and could be content to give him good report for’t, but that he pays himself with being proud.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nNay, but speak not maliciously.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nI say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it to that end. Though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nWhat he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nIf I must not, I need not be barren of accusations. He hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. [Shouts within.] What shouts are these? The other side o’ th’ city is risen. Why stay we prating here? To th’ Capitol!\n\nALL.\nCome, come!\n\nEnter Menenius Agrippa.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nSoft, who comes here?\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nWorthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always loved the people.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nHe’s one honest enough. Would all the rest were so!\n\nMENENIUS.\nWhat work’s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you\nWith bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nOur business is not unknown to th’ Senate. They have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we’ll show ’em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.\n\nMENENIUS.\nWhy, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,\nWill you undo yourselves?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nWe cannot, sir; we are undone already.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI tell you, friends, most charitable care\nHave the patricians of you. For your wants,\nYour suffering in this dearth, you may as well\nStrike at the heaven with your staves as lift them\nAgainst the Roman state, whose course will on\nThe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs\nOf more strong link asunder than can ever\nAppear in your impediment. For the dearth,\nThe gods, not the patricians, make it, and\nYour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,\nYou are transported by calamity\nThither where more attends you, and you slander\nThe helms o’ th’ state, who care for you like fathers,\nWhen you curse them as enemies.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nCare for us? True, indeed! They ne’er cared for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain; make edicts for usury to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there’s all the love they bear us.\n\nMENENIUS.\nEither you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious\nOr be accused of folly. I shall tell you\nA pretty tale. It may be you have heard it,\nBut since it serves my purpose, I will venture\nTo stale’t a little more.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nWell, I’ll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an’t please you, deliver.\n\nMENENIUS.\nThere was a time when all the body’s members\nRebelled against the belly, thus accused it:\nThat only like a gulf it did remain\nI’ th’ midst o’ th’ body, idle and unactive,\nStill cupboarding the viand, never bearing\nLike labour with the rest, where th’ other instruments\nDid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,\nAnd, mutually participate, did minister\nUnto the appetite and affection common\nOf the whole body. The belly answered—\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nWell, sir, what answer made the belly?\n\nMENENIUS.\nSir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,\nWhich ne’er came from the lungs, but even thus—\nFor, look you, I may make the belly smile\nAs well as speak—it tauntingly replied\nTo th’ discontented members, the mutinous parts\nThat envied his receipt; even so most fitly\nAs you malign our senators for that\nThey are not such as you.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nYour belly’s answer—what?\nThe kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,\nThe counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,\nOur steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,\nWith other muniments and petty helps\nIs this our fabric, if that they—\n\nMENENIUS.\nWhat then?\n’Fore me, this fellow speaks. What then? What then?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nShould by the cormorant belly be restrained,\nWho is the sink o’ th’ body—\n\nMENENIUS.\nWell, what then?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nThe former agents, if they did complain,\nWhat could the belly answer?\n\nMENENIUS.\nI will tell you,\nIf you’ll bestow a small—of what you have little—\nPatience awhile, you’st hear the belly’s answer.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nYou are long about it.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNote me this, good friend;\nYour most grave belly was deliberate,\nNot rash like his accusers, and thus answered:\n“True is it, my incorporate friends,” quoth he,\n“That I receive the general food at first\nWhich you do live upon; and fit it is,\nBecause I am the storehouse and the shop\nOf the whole body. But, if you do remember,\nI send it through the rivers of your blood\nEven to the court, the heart, to th’ seat o’ th’ brain;\nAnd, through the cranks and offices of man,\nThe strongest nerves and small inferior veins\nFrom me receive that natural competency\nWhereby they live. And though that all at once,\nYou, my good friends”—this says the belly, mark me—\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nAy, sir, well, well.\n\nMENENIUS.\n“Though all at once cannot\nSee what I do deliver out to each,\nYet I can make my audit up, that all\nFrom me do back receive the flour of all,\nAnd leave me but the bran.” What say you to’t?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nIt was an answer. How apply you this?\n\nMENENIUS.\nThe senators of Rome are this good belly,\nAnd you the mutinous members. For examine\nTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightly\nTouching the weal o’ th’ common, you shall find\nNo public benefit which you receive\nBut it proceeds or comes from them to you\nAnd no way from yourselves. What do you think,\nYou, the great toe of this assembly?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nI the great toe? Why the great toe?\n\nMENENIUS.\nFor that, being one o’ th’ lowest, basest, poorest,\nOf this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.\nThou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,\nLead’st first to win some vantage.\nBut make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.\nRome and her rats are at the point of battle;\nThe one side must have bale.\n\nEnter Caius Martius.\n\nHail, noble Martius.\n\nMARTIUS.\nThanks.—What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues,\nThat, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,\nMake yourselves scabs?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nWe have ever your good word.\n\nMARTIUS.\nHe that will give good words to thee will flatter\nBeneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,\nThat like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you;\nThe other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,\nWhere he should find you lions, finds you hares;\nWhere foxes, geese. You are no surer, no,\nThan is the coal of fire upon the ice\nOr hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is\nTo make him worthy whose offence subdues him,\nAnd curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness\nDeserves your hate; and your affections are\nA sick man’s appetite, who desires most that\nWhich would increase his evil. He that depends\nUpon your favours swims with fins of lead,\nAnd hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?\nWith every minute you do change a mind\nAnd call him noble that was now your hate,\nHim vile that was your garland. What’s the matter,\nThat in these several places of the city\nYou cry against the noble senate, who,\nUnder the gods, keep you in awe, which else\nWould feed on one another?—What’s their seeking?\n\nMENENIUS.\nFor corn at their own rates, whereof they say\nThe city is well stored.\n\nMARTIUS.\nHang ’em! They say?\nThey’ll sit by th’ fire and presume to know\nWhat’s done i’ th’ Capitol, who’s like to rise,\nWho thrives and who declines; side factions and give out\nConjectural marriages, making parties strong\nAnd feebling such as stand not in their liking\nBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there’s grain enough?\nWould the nobility lay aside their ruth\nAnd let me use my sword, I’d make a quarry\nWith thousands of these quartered slaves as high\nAs I could pick my lance.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;\nFor though abundantly they lack discretion,\nYet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,\nWhat says the other troop?\n\nMARTIUS.\nThey are dissolved. Hang ’em!\nThey said they were an-hungry, sighed forth proverbs\nThat hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,\nThat meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not\nCorn for the rich men only. With these shreds\nThey vented their complainings, which being answered\nAnd a petition granted them—a strange one,\nTo break the heart of generosity\nAnd make bold power look pale—they threw their caps\nAs they would hang them on the horns o’ th’ moon,\nShouting their emulation.\n\nMENENIUS.\nWhat is granted them?\n\nMARTIUS.\nFive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\nOf their own choice. One’s Junius Brutus,\nSicinius Velutus, and I know not. ’Sdeath!\nThe rabble should have first unroofed the city\nEre so prevailed with me. It will in time\nWin upon power and throw forth greater themes\nFor insurrection’s arguing.\n\nMENENIUS.\nThis is strange.\n\nMARTIUS.\nGo get you home, you fragments.\n\nEnter a Messenger hastily.\n\nMESSENGER.\nWhere’s Caius Martius?\n\nMARTIUS.\nHere. What’s the matter?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.\n\nMARTIUS.\nI am glad on’t. Then we shall ha’ means to vent\nOur musty superfluity.\n\nEnter Sicinius Velutus, Junius Brutus, two Tribunes; Cominius, Titus Lartius with other Senators.\n\nSee, our best elders.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nMartius, ’tis true that you have lately told us:\nThe Volsces are in arms.\n\nMARTIUS.\nThey have a leader,\nTullus Aufidius, that will put you to’t.\nI sin in envying his nobility,\nAnd, were I anything but what I am,\nI would wish me only he.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nYou have fought together.\n\nMARTIUS.\nWere half to half the world by th’ ears and he\nUpon my party, I’d revolt, to make\nOnly my wars with him. He is a lion\nThat I am proud to hunt.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nThen, worthy Martius,\nAttend upon Cominius to these wars.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nIt is your former promise.\n\nMARTIUS.\nSir, it is,\nAnd I am constant.—Titus Lartius, thou\nShalt see me once more strike at Tullus’ face.\nWhat, art thou stiff? Stand’st out?\n\nTITUS LARTIUS.\nNo, Caius Martius,\nI’ll lean upon one crutch and fight with th’ other\nEre stay behind this business.\n\nMENENIUS.\nO, true bred!\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nYour company to th’ Capitol, where I know\nOur greatest friends attend us.\n\nTITUS LARTIUS.\nLead you on.\nFollow Cominius. We must follow you;\nRight worthy your priority.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nNoble Martius.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\n[To the Citizens.]\nHence to your homes, begone.\n\nMARTIUS.\nNay, let them follow.\nThe Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither\nTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,\nYour valour puts well forth. Pray follow.\n\n[Exeunt. Sicinius and Brutus remain.]\n\nSICINIUS.\nWas ever man so proud as is this Martius?\n\nBRUTUS.\nHe has no equal.\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhen we were chosen tribunes for the people—\n\nBRUTUS.\nMarked you his lip and eyes?\n\nSICINIUS.\nNay, but his taunts.\n\nBRUTUS.\nBeing moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.\n\nSICINIUS.\nBemock the modest moon.\n\nBRUTUS.\nThe present wars devour him! He is grown\nToo proud to be so valiant.\n\nSICINIUS.\nSuch a nature,\nTickled with good success, disdains the shadow\nWhich he treads on at noon. But I do wonder\nHis insolence can brook to be commanded\nUnder Cominius.\n\nBRUTUS.\nFame, at the which he aims,\nIn whom already he’s well graced, cannot\nBetter be held nor more attained than by\nA place below the first; for what miscarries\nShall be the General’s fault, though he perform\nTo th’ utmost of a man, and giddy censure\nWill then cry out of Martius “O, if he\nHad borne the business!”\n\nSICINIUS.\nBesides, if things go well,\nOpinion that so sticks on Martius shall\nOf his demerits rob Cominius.\n\nBRUTUS.\nCome.\nHalf all Cominius’ honours are to Martius,\nThough Martius earned them not, and all his faults\nTo Martius shall be honours, though indeed\nIn aught he merit not.\n\nSICINIUS.\nLet’s hence and hear\nHow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,\nMore than in singularity, he goes\nUpon this present action.\n\nBRUTUS.\nLet’s along.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. Rome. An apartment in Martius’ house\nEnter Volumnia and Virgilia, mother and wife to Martius. They set them down on two low stools and sew.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nI pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings’ entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering how honour would become such a person—that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th’ wall, if renown made it not stir—was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nBut had he died in the business, madam, how then?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nThen his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.\n\nEnter a Gentlewoman.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN.\nMadam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nBeseech you, give me leave to retire myself.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nIndeed you shall not.\nMethinks I hear hither your husband’s drum,\nSee him pluck Aufidius down by th’ hair;\nAs children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.\nMethinks I see him stamp thus and call thus:\n“Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,\nThough you were born in Rome.” His bloody brow\nWith his mailed hand then wiping, forth he goes\nLike to a harvestman that’s tasked to mow\nOr all or lose his hire.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nHis bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nAway, you fool! It more becomes a man\nThan gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,\nWhen she did suckle Hector, looked not lovelier\nThan Hector’s forehead when it spit forth blood\nAt Grecian sword, contemning.—Tell Valeria\nWe are fit to bid her welcome.\n\n[Exit Gentlewoman.]\n\nVIRGILIA.\nHeavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nHe’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee\nAnd tread upon his neck.\n\nEnter Valeria with an Usher and a Gentlewoman.\n\nVALERIA.\nMy ladies both, good day to you.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nSweet madam.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nI am glad to see your Ladyship.\n\nVALERIA.\nHow do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little son?\n\nVIRGILIA.\nI thank your Ladyship; well, good madam.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nHe had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster.\n\nVALERIA.\nO’ my word, the father’s son! I’ll swear ’tis a very pretty boy. O’ my troth, I looked upon him o’ Wednesday half an hour together. H’as such a confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again, catched it again. Or whether his fall enraged him or how ’twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant how he mammocked it!\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nOne on’s father’s moods.\n\nVALERIA.\nIndeed, la, ’tis a noble child.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nA crack, madam.\n\nVALERIA.\nCome, lay aside your stitchery. I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nNo, good madam, I will not out of doors.\n\nVALERIA.\nNot out of doors?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nShe shall, she shall.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nIndeed, no, by your patience. I’ll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.\n\nVALERIA.\nFie, you confine yourself most unreasonably. Come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nI will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers, but I cannot go thither.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nWhy, I pray you?\n\nVIRGILIA.\n’Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.\n\nVALERIA.\nYou would be another Penelope. Yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nNo, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.\n\nVALERIA.\nIn truth, la, go with me, and I’ll tell you excellent news of your husband.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nO, good madam, there can be none yet.\n\nVALERIA.\nVerily, I do not jest with you. There came news from him last night.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nIndeed, madam!\n\nVALERIA.\nIn earnest, it’s true. I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth, against whom Cominius the General is gone with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles. They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honour, and so, I pray, go with us.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nGive me excuse, good madam. I will obey you in everything hereafter.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nLet her alone, lady. As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.\n\nVALERIA.\nIn troth, I think she would.—Fare you well, then.—Come, good sweet lady.—Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o’ door, and go along with us.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nNo, at a word, madam. Indeed I must not. I wish you much mirth.\n\nVALERIA.\nWell then, farewell.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures, at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius for being proud.\n\nBRUTUS.\nWe do it not alone, sir.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI know you can do very little alone, for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single. Your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone. You talk of pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O, that you could!\n\nBOTH TRIBUNES.\nWhat then, sir?\n\nMENENIUS.\nWhy, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.\n\nSICINIUS.\nMenenius, you are known well enough, too.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in’t; said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as you are—I cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables. And though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be known well enough, too?\n\nBRUTUS.\nCome, sir, come; we know you well enough.\n\nMENENIUS.\nYou know neither me, yourselves, nor anything. You are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a faucet-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.\n\nBRUTUS.\nCome, come. You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.\n\nMENENIUS.\nOur very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher’s cushion or to be entombed in an ass’s packsaddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is proud, who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of ’em were hereditary hangmen. Good e’en to your Worships. More of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.\n\n[He begins to exit. Brutus and Sicinius stand aside.]\n\nEnter Volumnia, Virgilia and Valeria\n\nHow now, my as fair as noble ladies—and the moon, were she earthly, no nobler—whither do you follow your eyes so fast?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nHonourable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches. For the love of Juno, let’s go!\n\nMENENIUS.\nHa? Martius coming home?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nAy, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous approbation.\n\nMENENIUS.\nTake my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee! Hoo! Martius coming home?\n\nVALERIA, VIRGILIA.\nNay, ’tis true.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nLook, here’s a letter from him. The state hath another, his wife another, and I think there’s one at home for you.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI will make my very house reel tonight. A letter for me?\n\nVIRGILIA.\nYes, certain, there’s a letter for you; I saw it.\n\nMENENIUS.\nA letter for me? It gives me an estate of seven years’ health, in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to this preservative, of no better report than a horse drench. Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nO, no, no, no!\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nO, he is wounded, I thank the gods for’t.\n\nMENENIUS.\nSo do I too, if it be not too much. Brings he victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nOn’s brows, Menenius. He comes the third time home with the oaken garland.\n\nMENENIUS.\nHas he disciplined Aufidius soundly?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nTitus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.\n\nMENENIUS.\nAnd ’twas time for him too, I’ll warrant him that. An he had stayed by him, I would not have been so ’fidiused for all the chests in Corioles and the gold that’s in them. Is the Senate possessed of this?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nGood ladies, let’s go.—Yes, yes, yes. The Senate has letters from the General, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.\n\nVALERIA.\nIn troth, there’s wondrous things spoke of him.\n\nMENENIUS.\nWondrous? Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nThe gods grant them true.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nTrue? Pow, waw!\n\nMENENIUS.\nTrue? I’ll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? [To the Tribunes.] God save your good Worships! Martius is coming home; he has more cause to be proud.—Where is he wounded?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nI’ th’ shoulder and i’ th’ left arm. There will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place. He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i’ th’ body.\n\nMENENIUS.\nOne i’ th’ neck and two i’ th’ thigh—there’s nine that I know.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nHe had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNow it’s twenty-seven. Every gash was an enemy’s grave.\n[A shout and flourish.]\n\nHark, the trumpets!\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nThese are the ushers of Martius: before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.\nDeath, that dark spirit, in’s nervy arm doth lie,\nWhich, being advanced, declines, and then men die.\n\n[A sennet.]\n\nEnter Cominius the General and Titus Lartius, between them Coriolanus crowned with an oaken garland, with Captains and Soldiers and a Herald. Trumpets sound.\n\nHERALD.\nKnow, Rome, that all alone Martius did fight\nWithin Corioles’ gates, where he hath won,\nWith fame, a name to Caius Martius; these\nIn honour follows “Coriolanus.”\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus.\n\n[Sound flourish.]\n\nALL.\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nNo more of this, it does offend my heart.\nPray now, no more.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nLook, sir, your mother.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nO,\nYou have, I know, petitioned all the gods\nFor my prosperity.\n\n[Kneels.]\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nNay, my good soldier, up.\n\n[He stands.]\n\nMy gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and\nBy deed-achieving honour newly named—\nWhat is it? Coriolanus must I call thee?\nBut, O, thy wife—\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nMy gracious silence, hail.\nWouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home,\nThat weep’st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,\nSuch eyes the widows in Corioles wear\nAnd mothers that lack sons.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNow the gods crown thee!\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nAnd live you yet? [To Valeria] O my sweet lady, pardon.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nI know not where to turn. O, welcome home!\nAnd welcome, general.—And you’re welcome all.\n\nMENENIUS.\nA hundred thousand welcomes! I could weep,\nAnd I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome.\nA curse begin at very root on’s heart\nThat is not glad to see thee! You are three\nThat Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,\nWe have some old crab trees here at home that will not\nBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors!\nWe call a nettle but a nettle, and\nThe faults of fools but folly.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nEver right.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nMenenius ever, ever.\n\nHERALD.\nGive way there, and go on!\n\nCORIOLANUS.\n[To Volumnia and Virgilia.] Your hand, and yours.\nEre in our own house I do shade my head,\nThe good patricians must be visited,\nFrom whom I have received not only greetings,\nBut with them change of honours.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nI have lived\nTo see inherited my very wishes\nAnd the buildings of my fancy. Only\nThere’s one thing wanting, which I doubt not but\nOur Rome will cast upon thee.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nKnow, good mother,\nI had rather be their servant in my way\nThan sway with them in theirs.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nOn, to the Capitol.\n\n[Flourish of cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.]\n\nBrutus and Sicinius come forward.\n\nBRUTUS.\nAll tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights\nAre spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse\nInto a rapture lets her baby cry\nWhile she chats him. The kitchen malkin pins\nHer richest lockram ’bout her reechy neck,\nClamb’ring the walls to eye him. Stalls, bulks, windows\nAre smothered up, leads filled, and ridges horsed\nWith variable complexions, all agreeing\nIn earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens\nDo press among the popular throngs and puff\nTo win a vulgar station. Our veiled dames\nCommit the war of white and damask in\nTheir nicely-gauded cheeks to th’ wanton spoil\nOf Phoebus’ burning kisses. Such a pother,\nAs if that whatsoever god who leads him\nWere slyly crept into his human powers\nAnd gave him graceful posture.\n\nSICINIUS.\nOn the sudden\nI warrant him consul.\n\nBRUTUS.\nThen our office may,\nDuring his power, go sleep.\n\nSICINIUS.\nHe cannot temp’rately transport his honours\nFrom where he should begin and end, but will\nLose those he hath won.\n\nBRUTUS.\nIn that there’s comfort.\n\nSICINIUS.\nDoubt not the commoners, for whom we stand,\nBut they, upon their ancient malice will forget\nWith the least cause these his new honours—which\nThat he will give them make as little question\nAs he is proud to do’t.\n\nBRUTUS.\nI heard him swear,\nWere he to stand for consul, never would he\nAppear i’ th’ marketplace nor on him put\nThe napless vesture of humility,\nNor showing, as the manner is, his wounds\nTo th’ people, beg their stinking breaths.\n\nSICINIUS.\n’Tis right.\n\nBRUTUS.\nIt was his word. O, he would miss it rather\nThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him\nAnd the desire of the nobles.\n\nSICINIUS.\nI wish no better\nThan have him hold that purpose and to put it\nIn execution.\n\nBRUTUS.\n’Tis most like he will.\n\nSICINIUS.\nIt shall be to him then, as our good wills,\nA sure destruction.\n\nBRUTUS.\nSo it must fall out\nTo him, or our authorities for an end.\nWe must suggest the people in what hatred\nHe still hath held them; that to’s power he would\nHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders, and\nDispropertied their freedoms; holding them\nIn human action and capacity\nOf no more soul nor fitness for the world\nThan camels in their war, who have their provand\nOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blows\nFor sinking under them.\n\nSICINIUS.\nThis, as you say, suggested\nAt some time when his soaring insolence\nShall touch the people—which time shall not want\nIf it be put upon’t, and that’s as easy\nAs to set dogs on sheep—will be his fire\nTo kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze\nShall darken him for ever.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nBRUTUS.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nMESSENGER.\nYou are sent for to the Capitol. ’Tis thought\nThat Martius shall be consul. I have seen\nThe dumb men throng to see him, and the blind\nto hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,\nLadies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs,\nUpon him as he passed; the nobles bended\nAs to Jove’s statue, and the Commons made\nA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.\nI never saw the like.\n\nBRUTUS.\nLet’s to the Capitol;\nAnd carry with us ears and eyes for th’ time,\nBut hearts for the event.\n\nSICINIUS.\nHave with you.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "title":"Act II Scene II: Rome. The Capitol",
    "content":"SCENE II. Rome. The Capitol\nEnter two Officers, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nCome, come. They are almost here. How many stand for consulships?\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nThree, they say; but ’tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nThat’s a brave fellow, but he’s vengeance proud and loves not the common people.\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\n’Faith, there have been many great men that have flattered the people who ne’er loved them; and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore; so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see’t.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nIf he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently ’twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nHe hath deserved worthily of his country, and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonnetted, without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report; but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury. To report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nNo more of him; he’s a worthy man. Make way. They are coming.\n\nA sennet. Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the people, Lictors before them; Coriolanus, Menenius, Cominius the consul. The Patricians sit. Sicinius and Brutus take their places by themselves. Coriolanus stands.\n\nMENENIUS.\nHaving determined of the Volsces and\nTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,\nAs the main point of this our after-meeting,\nTo gratify his noble service that\nHath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,\nMost reverend and grave elders, to desire\nThe present consul and last general\nIn our well-found successes to report\nA little of that worthy work performed\nBy Martius Caius Coriolanus, whom\nWe met here both to thank and to remember\nWith honours like himself.\n\n[Coriolanus sits.]\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nSpeak, good Cominius.\nLeave nothing out for length, and make us think\nRather our state’s defective for requital,\nThan we to stretch it out. Masters o’ th’ people,\nWe do request your kindest ears and, after,\nYour loving motion toward the common body\nTo yield what passes here.\n\nSICINIUS.\nWe are convented\nUpon a pleasing treaty and have hearts\nInclinable to honour and advance\nThe theme of our assembly.\n\nBRUTUS.\nWhich the rather\nWe shall be blest to do if he remember\nA kinder value of the people than\nHe hath hereto prized them at.\n\nMENENIUS.\nThat’s off, that’s off!\nI would you rather had been silent. Please you\nTo hear Cominius speak?\n\nBRUTUS.\nMost willingly.\nBut yet my caution was more pertinent\nThan the rebuke you give it.\n\nMENENIUS.\nHe loves your people,\nBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.—\nWorthy Cominius, speak.\n\n[Coriolanus rises, and offers to go away.]\n\nNay, keep your place.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nSit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear\nWhat you have nobly done.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nYour Honours, pardon.\nI had rather have my wounds to heal again\nThan hear say how I got them.\n\nBRUTUS.\nSir, I hope\nMy words disbenched you not?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nNo, sir. Yet oft,\nWhen blows have made me stay, I fled from words.\nYou soothed not, therefore hurt not; but your people,\nI love them as they weigh.\n\nMENENIUS.\nPray now, sit down.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI had rather have one scratch my head i’ th’ sun\nWhen the alarum were struck than idly sit\nTo hear my nothings monstered.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nMENENIUS.\nMasters of the people,\nYour multiplying spawn how can he flatter—\nThat’s thousand to one good one—when you now see\nHe had rather venture all his limbs for honour\nThan one on’s ears to hear it?—Proceed, Cominius.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nI shall lack voice. The deeds of Coriolanus\nShould not be uttered feebly. It is held\nThat valour is the chiefest virtue and\nMost dignifies the haver; if it be,\nThe man I speak of cannot in the world\nBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,\nWhen Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought\nBeyond the mark of others. Our then dictator,\nWhom with all praise I point at, saw him fight\nWhen with his Amazonian chin he drove\nThe bristled lips before him. He bestrid\nAn o’erpressed Roman and i’ th’ Consul’s view\nSlew three opposers. Tarquin’s self he met\nAnd struck him on his knee. In that day’s feats,\nWhen he might act the woman in the scene,\nHe proved best man i’ th’ field and for his meed\nWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age\nMan-entered thus, he waxed like a sea,\nAnd in the brunt of seventeen battles since\nHe lurched all swords of the garland. For this last,\nBefore and in Corioles, let me say,\nI cannot speak him home. He stopped the flyers\nAnd by his rare example made the coward\nTurn terror into sport. As weeds before\nA vessel under sail, so men obeyed\nAnd fell below his stem. His sword, Death’s stamp,\nWhere it did mark, it took; from face to foot\nHe was a thing of blood, whose every motion\nWas timed with dying cries. Alone he entered\nThe mortal gate o’ th’ city, which he painted\nWith shunless destiny; aidless came off\nAnd with a sudden reinforcement struck\nCorioles like a planet. Now all’s his,\nWhen by and by the din of war gan pierce\nHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit\nRequickened what in flesh was fatigate,\nAnd to the battle came he, where he did\nRun reeking o’er the lives of men as if\n’Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we called\nBoth field and city ours, he never stood\nTo ease his breast with panting.\n\nMENENIUS.\nWorthy man!\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nHe cannot but with measure fit the honours\nWhich we devise him.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nOur spoils he kicked at;\nAnd looked upon things precious as they were\nThe common muck of the world. He covets less\nThan misery itself would give, rewards\nHis deeds with doing them, and is content\nTo spend the time to end it.\n\nMENENIUS.\nHe’s right noble.\nLet him be called for.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nCall Coriolanus.\n\nOFFICER.\nHe doth appear.\n\nEnter Coriolanus.\n\nMENENIUS.\nThe Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased\nTo make thee consul.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI do owe them still\nMy life and services.\n\nMENENIUS.\nIt then remains\nThat you do speak to the people.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI do beseech you\nLet me o’erleap that custom, for I cannot\nPut on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them\nFor my wounds’ sake to give their suffrage. Please you\nThat I may pass this doing.\n\nSICINIUS.\nSir, the people\nMust have their voices; neither will they bate\nOne jot of ceremony.\n\nMENENIUS.\nPut them not to’t.\nPray you, go fit you to the custom, and\nTake to you, as your predecessors have,\nYour honour with your form.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nIt is a part\nThat I shall blush in acting, and might well\nBe taken from the people.\n\nBRUTUS.\nMark you that?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nTo brag unto them, “thus I did, and thus!”\nShow them th’ unaching scars which I should hide,\nAs if I had received them for the hire\nOf their breath only!\n\nMENENIUS.\nDo not stand upon’t.—\nWe recommend to you, tribunes of the people,\nOur purpose to them, and to our noble consul\nWish we all joy and honour.\n\nSENATORS.\nTo Coriolanus come all joy and honour!\n\n[Flourish cornets. Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus.]\n\nBRUTUS.\nYou see how he intends to use the people.\n\nSICINIUS.\nMay they perceive’s intent! He will require them\nAs if he did contemn what he requested\nShould be in them to give.\n\nBRUTUS.\nCome, we’ll inform them\nOf our proceedings here. On th’ marketplace\nI know they do attend us.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. Rome. The Forum\nEnter seven or eight Citizens.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nOnce, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nWe may, sir, if we will.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nWe have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for, if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them. So, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude, of the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nAnd to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nWe have been called so of many; not that our heads are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely coloured; and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o’ th’ compass.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nThink you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly?\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nNay, your wit will not so soon out as another man’s will; ’tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead. But if it were at liberty, ’twould, sure, southward.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nWhy that way?\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nTo lose itself in a fog, where being three parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience’ sake, to help to get thee a wife.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nYou are never without your tricks. You may, you may.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nAre you all resolved to give your voices? But that’s no matter; the greater part carries it. I say, if he would incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.\n\nEnter Coriolanus in a gown of humility, with Menenius.\n\nHere he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour. We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He’s to make his requests by particulars, wherein everyone of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues. Therefore follow me, and I’ll direct you how you shall go by him.\n\nALL.\nContent, content.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nMENENIUS.\nO sir, you are not right. Have you not known\nThe worthiest men have done’t?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhat must I say?\n“I pray, sir”—plague upon’t! I cannot bring\nMy tongue to such a pace. “Look, sir, my wounds!\nI got them in my country’s service when\nSome certain of your brethren roared and ran\nFrom th’ noise of our own drums.”\n\nMENENIUS.\nO me, the gods!\nYou must not speak of that. You must desire them\nTo think upon you.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThink upon me! Hang ’em!\nI would they would forget me, like the virtues\nWhich our divines lose by ’em.\n\nMENENIUS.\nYou’ll mar all.\nI’ll leave you. Pray you speak to ’em, I pray you,\nIn wholesome manner.\n\n[Exit Menenius.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nBid them wash their faces\nAnd keep their teeth clean.\n\nEnter three of the Citizens.\n\nSo, here comes a brace.\nYou know the cause, sirs, of my standing here.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nWe do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you to’t.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nMine own desert.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nYour own desert?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nAy, but not mine own desire.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nHow, not your own desire?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nNo, sir, ’twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nYou must think if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWell then, I pray, your price o’ th’ consulship?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nThe price is to ask it kindly.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nKindly, sir, I pray, let me ha’t. I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.—Your good voice, sir. What say you?\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nYou shall ha’ it, worthy sir.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nA match, sir. There’s in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nBut this is something odd.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nAn ’twere to give again—but ’tis no matter.\n\n[Exeunt two citizens.]\n\nEnter two other Citizens.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nPray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.\n\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\nYou have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nYour enigma?\n\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\nYou have been a scourge to her enemies; you have been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common people.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nYou should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; ’tis a condition they account gentle. And since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be consul.\n\nFIFTH CITIZEN.\nWe hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.\n\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\nYou have received many wounds for your country.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther.\n\nBOTH CITIZENS.\nThe gods give you joy, sir, heartily.\n\n[Exeunt citizens.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nMost sweet voices!\nBetter it is to die, better to starve,\nThan crave the hire which first we do deserve.\nWhy in this wolvish toge should I stand here\nTo beg of Hob and Dick that does appear\nTheir needless vouches? Custom calls me to’t.\nWhat custom wills, in all things should we do’t?\nThe dust on antique time would lie unswept\nAnd mountainous error be too highly heaped\nFor truth to o’erpeer. Rather than fool it so,\nLet the high office and the honour go\nTo one that would do thus. I am half through;\nThe one part suffered, the other will I do.\nEnter three Citizens more.\n\nHere come more voices.\nYour voices! For your voices I have fought;\nWatched for your voices; for your voices bear\nOf wounds two dozen odd. Battles thrice six\nI have seen and heard of; for your voices have\nDone many things, some less, some more. Your voices!\nIndeed, I would be consul.\n\nSIXTH CITIZEN.\nHe has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man’s voice.\n\nSEVENTH CITIZEN.\nTherefore let him be consul. The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people!\n\nALL THREE CITIZENS.\nAmen, amen. God save thee, noble consul.\n\n[Exeunt citizens.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWorthy voices!\n\nEnter Menenius with Brutus and Sicinius.\n\nMENENIUS.\nYou have stood your limitation, and the Tribunes\nEndue you with the people’s voice. Remains\nThat in th’ official marks invested, you\nAnon do meet the Senate.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nIs this done?\n\nSICINIUS.\nThe custom of request you have discharged.\nThe people do admit you, and are summoned\nTo meet anon upon your approbation.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhere? At the Senate House?\n\nSICINIUS.\nThere, Coriolanus.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nMay I change these garments?\n\nSICINIUS.\nYou may, sir.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThat I’ll straight do and, knowing myself again,\nRepair to th’ Senate House.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI’ll keep you company.—Will you along?\n\nBRUTUS.\nWe stay here for the people.\n\nSICINIUS.\nFare you well.\n\n[Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius.]\n\nHe has it now; and by his looks, methinks,\n’Tis warm at his heart.\n\nBRUTUS.\nWith a proud heart he wore\nHis humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?\n\nEnter the Pebleians.\n\nSICINIUS.\nHow now, my masters, have you chose this man?\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nHe has our voices, sir.\n\nBRUTUS.\nWe pray the gods he may deserve your loves.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nAmen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,\nHe mocked us when he begged our voices.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nCertainly, he flouted us downright.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nNo, ’tis his kind of speech. He did not mock us.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nNot one amongst us, save yourself, but says\nHe used us scornfully. He should have showed us\nHis marks of merit, wounds received for’s country.\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhy, so he did, I am sure.\n\nALL.\nNo, no. No man saw ’em.\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nHe said he had wounds, which he could show in private,\nAnd with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,\n“I would be consul,” says he; “aged custom,\nBut by your voices, will not so permit me;\nYour voices therefore.” When we granted that,\nHere was “I thank you for your voices. Thank you.\nYour most sweet voices! Now you have left your voices,\nI have no further with you.” Was not this mockery?\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhy either were you ignorant to see’t\nOr, seeing it, of such childish friendliness\nTo yield your voices?\n\nBRUTUS.\nCould you not have told him\nAs you were lessoned? When he had no power,\nBut was a petty servant to the state,\nHe was your enemy, ever spake against\nYour liberties and the charters that you bear\nI’ th’ body of the weal; and, now arriving\nA place of potency and sway o’ th’ state,\nIf he should still malignantly remain\nFast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might\nBe curses to yourselves. You should have said\nThat as his worthy deeds did claim no less\nThan what he stood for, so his gracious nature\nWould think upon you for your voices, and\nTranslate his malice towards you into love,\nStanding your friendly lord.\n\nSICINIUS.\nThus to have said,\nAs you were fore-advised, had touched his spirit\nAnd tried his inclination; from him plucked\nEither his gracious promise, which you might,\nAs cause had called you up, have held him to;\nOr else it would have galled his surly nature,\nWhich easily endures not article\nTying him to aught. So putting him to rage,\nYou should have ta’en th’ advantage of his choler\nAnd passed him unelected.\n\nBRUTUS.\nDid you perceive\nHe did solicit you in free contempt\nWhen he did need your loves, and do you think\nThat his contempt shall not be bruising to you\nWhen he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies\nNo heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry\nAgainst the rectorship of judgment?\n\nSICINIUS.\nHave you ere now denied the asker, and now\nAgain, of him that did not ask but mock,\nBestow your sued-for tongues?\n\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\nHe’s not confirmed.\nWe may deny him yet.\n\nSECOND CITIZEN.\nAnd will deny him.\nI’ll have five hundred voices of that sound.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nI twice five hundred, and their friends to piece ’em.\n\nBRUTUS.\nGet you hence instantly, and tell those friends\nThey have chose a consul that will from them take\nTheir liberties, make them of no more voice\nThan dogs that are as often beat for barking\nAs therefore kept to do so.\n\nSICINIUS.\nLet them assemble\nAnd, on a safer judgment, all revoke\nYour ignorant election. Enforce his pride\nAnd his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not\nWith what contempt he wore the humble weed,\nHow in his suit he scorned you; but your loves,\nThinking upon his services, took from you\nTh’ apprehension of his present portance,\nWhich most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion\nAfter the inveterate hate he bears you.\n\nBRUTUS.\nLay\nA fault on us, your tribunes, that we laboured,\nNo impediment between, but that you must\nCast your election on him.\n\nSICINIUS.\nSay you chose him\nMore after our commandment than as guided\nBy your own true affections, and that your minds,\nPreoccupied with what you rather must do\nThan what you should, made you against the grain\nTo voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.\n\nBRUTUS.\nAy, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,\nHow youngly he began to serve his country,\nHow long continued, and what stock he springs of,\nThe noble house o’ th’ Martians, from whence came\nThat Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,\nWho, after great Hostilius here was king,\nOf the same house Publius and Quintus were,\nThat our best water brought by conduits hither;\nAnd Censorinus, that was so surnamed,\nAnd nobly named so, twice being censor,\nWas his great ancestor.\n\nSICINIUS.\nOne thus descended,\nThat hath beside well in his person wrought\nTo be set high in place, we did commend\nTo your remembrances; but you have found,\nScaling his present bearing with his past,\nThat he’s your fixed enemy, and revoke\nYour sudden approbation.\n\nBRUTUS.\nSay you ne’er had done’t—\nHarp on that still—but by our putting on.\nAnd presently when you have drawn your number,\nRepair to th’ Capitol.\n\nALL.\nWe will so. Almost all\nRepent in their election.\n\n[Exeunt Plebeians.]\n\nBRUTUS.\nLet them go on.\nThis mutiny were better put in hazard\nThan stay, past doubt, for greater.\nIf, as his nature is, he fall in rage\nWith their refusal, both observe and answer\nThe vantage of his anger.\n\nSICINIUS.\nTo th’ Capitol, come.\nWe will be there before the stream o’ th’ people,\nAnd this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own,\nWhich we have goaded onward.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT III\nSCENE I. Rome. A street\nCornets. Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, all the Gentry, Cominius, Titus Lartius and other Senators.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nTullus Aufidius then had made new head?\n\nLARTIUS.\nHe had, my lord, and that it was which caused\nOur swifter composition.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nSo then the Volsces stand but as at first,\nReady, when time shall prompt them, to make road\nUpon’s again.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nThey are worn, lord consul, so\nThat we shall hardly in our ages see\nTheir banners wave again.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nSaw you Aufidius?\n\nLARTIUS.\nOn safeguard he came to me, and did curse\nAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilely\nYielded the town. He is retired to Antium.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nSpoke he of me?\n\nLARTIUS.\nHe did, my lord.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nHow? What?\n\nLARTIUS.\nHow often he had met you sword to sword;\nThat of all things upon the earth he hated\nYour person most; that he would pawn his fortunes\nTo hopeless restitution, so he might\nBe called your vanquisher.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nAt Antium lives he?\n\nLARTIUS.\nAt Antium.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI wish I had a cause to seek him there,\nTo oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.\n\nEnter Sicinius and Brutus.\n\nBehold, these are the tribunes of the people,\nThe tongues o’ th’ common mouth. I do despise them,\nFor they do prank them in authority\nAgainst all noble sufferance.\n\nSICINIUS.\nPass no further.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nHa? What is that?\n\nBRUTUS.\nIt will be dangerous to go on. No further.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhat makes this change?\n\nMENENIUS.\nThe matter?\n\nCOMINIUS.\nHath he not passed the noble and the common?\n\nBRUTUS.\nCominius, no.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nHave I had children’s voices?\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nTribunes, give way. He shall to the marketplace.\n\nBRUTUS.\nThe people are incensed against him.\n\nSICINIUS.\nStop,\nOr all will fall in broil.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nAre these your herd?\nMust these have voices, that can yield them now\nAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?\nYou being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?\nHave you not set them on?\n\nMENENIUS.\nBe calm, be calm.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nIt is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,\nTo curb the will of the nobility.\nSuffer’t, and live with such as cannot rule\nNor ever will be ruled.\n\nBRUTUS.\nCall’t not a plot.\nThe people cry you mocked them; and, of late,\nWhen corn was given them gratis, you repined,\nScandaled the suppliants for the people, called them\nTimepleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhy, this was known before.\n\nBRUTUS.\nNot to them all.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nHave you informed them sithence?\n\nBRUTUS.\nHow? I inform them?\n\nCOMINIUS.\nYou are like to do such business.\n\nBRUTUS.\nNot unlike, each way, to better yours.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhy then should I be consul? By yond clouds,\nLet me deserve so ill as you, and make me\nYour fellow tribune.\n\nSICINIUS.\nYou show too much of that\nFor which the people stir. If you will pass\nTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,\nWhich you are out of, with a gentler spirit,\nOr never be so noble as a consul,\nNor yoke with him for tribune.\n\nMENENIUS.\nLet’s be calm.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nThe people are abused, set on. This palt’ring\nBecomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus\nDeserved this so dishonoured rub, laid falsely\nI’ th’ plain way of his merit.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nTell me of corn?\nThis was my speech, and I will speak’t again.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNot now, not now.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nNot in this heat, sir, now.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nNow, as I live, I will.\nMy nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For\nThe mutable, rank-scented many, let them\nRegard me, as I do not flatter, and\nTherein behold themselves. I say again,\nIn soothing them we nourish ’gainst our senate\nThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,\nWhich we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered\nBy mingling them with us, the honoured number,\nWho lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that\nWhich they have given to beggars.\n\nMENENIUS.\nWell, no more.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nNo more words, we beseech you.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nHow? No more?\nAs for my country I have shed my blood,\nNot fearing outward force, so shall my lungs\nCoin words till their decay against those measles\nWhich we disdain should tetter us, yet sought\nThe very way to catch them.\n\nBRUTUS.\nYou speak o’ th’ people\nAs if you were a god to punish, not\nA man of their infirmity.\n\nSICINIUS.\n’Twere well\nWe let the people know’t.\n\nMENENIUS.\nWhat, what? His choler?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nCholer?\nWere I as patient as the midnight sleep,\nBy Jove, ’twould be my mind.\n\nSICINIUS.\nIt is a mind\nThat shall remain a poison where it is,\nNot poison any further.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\n“Shall remain”?\nHear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you\nHis absolute “shall”?\n\nCOMINIUS.\n’Twas from the canon.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\n“Shall”?\nO good but most unwise patricians, why,\nYou grave but reckless senators, have you thus\nGiven Hydra leave to choose an officer,\nThat with his peremptory “shall,” being but\nThe horn and noise o’ th’ monster’s, wants not spirit\nTo say he’ll turn your current in a ditch\nAnd make your channel his? If he have power,\nThen vail your ignorance; if none, awake\nYour dangerous lenity. If you are learned,\nBe not as common fools; if you are not,\nLet them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,\nIf they be senators; and they are no less\nWhen, both your voices blended, the great’st taste\nMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,\nAnd such a one as he, who puts his “shall,”\nHis popular “shall,” against a graver bench\nThan ever frowned in Greece. By Jove himself,\nIt makes the consuls base! And my soul aches\nTo know, when two authorities are up,\nNeither supreme, how soon confusion\nMay enter ’twixt the gap of both and take\nThe one by th’ other.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nWell, on to th’ marketplace.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhoever gave that counsel to give forth\nThe corn o’ th’ storehouse gratis, as ’twas used\nSometime in Greece—\n\nMENENIUS.\nWell, well, no more of that.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThough there the people had more absolute power,\nI say they nourished disobedience, fed\nThe ruin of the state.\n\nBRUTUS.\nWhy shall the people give\nOne that speaks thus their voice?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI’ll give my reasons,\nMore worthier than their voices. They know the corn\nWas not our recompense, resting well assured\nThey ne’er did service for’t. Being pressed to th’ war,\nEven when the navel of the state was touched,\nThey would not thread the gates. This kind of service\nDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ th’ war,\nTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they showed\nMost valour, spoke not for them. Th’ accusation\nWhich they have often made against the Senate,\nAll cause unborn, could never be the native\nOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?\nHow shall this bosom multitude digest\nThe senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express\nWhat’s like to be their words: “We did request it;\nWe are the greater poll, and in true fear\nThey gave us our demands.” Thus we debase\nThe nature of our seats and make the rabble\nCall our cares fears, which will in time\nBreak ope the locks o’ th’ Senate and bring in\nThe crows to peck the eagles.\n\nMENENIUS.\nCome, enough.\n\nBRUTUS.\nEnough, with over-measure.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nNo, take more!\nWhat may be sworn by, both divine and human,\nSeal what I end withal! This double worship—\nWhere one part does disdain with cause, the other\nInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom\nCannot conclude but by the yea and no\nOf general ignorance—it must omit\nReal necessities and give way the while\nTo unstable slightness. Purpose so barred, it follows\nNothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you—\nYou that will be less fearful than discreet,\nThat love the fundamental part of state\nMore than you doubt the change on’t, that prefer\nA noble life before a long, and wish\nTo jump a body with a dangerous physic\nThat’s sure of death without it—at once pluck out\nThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\nThe sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour\nMangles true judgment and bereaves the state\nOf that integrity which should become’t,\nNot having the power to do the good it would\nFor th’ ill which doth control’t.\n\nBRUTUS.\n’Has said enough.\n\nSICINIUS.\n’Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer\nAs traitors do.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee!\nWhat should the people do with these bald tribunes,\nOn whom depending, their obedience fails\nTo th’ greater bench. In a rebellion,\nWhen what’s not meet but what must be was law,\nThen were they chosen. In a better hour,\nLet what is meet be said it must be meet,\nAnd throw their power i’ th’ dust.\n\nBRUTUS.\nManifest treason.\n\nSICINIUS.\nThis a consul? No.\n\nBRUTUS.\nThe aediles, ho! Let him be apprehended.\n\nEnter an Aedile.\n\nSICINIUS.\nGo call the people;\n\n[Exit Aedile.]\n\nin whose name myself\nAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,\nA foe to th’ public weal. Obey, I charge thee,\nAnd follow to thine answer.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nHence, old goat.\n\nALL PATRICIANS.\nWe’ll surety him.\n\nCOMINIUS.\n[to Sicinius.] Aged sir, hands off.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\n[to Sicinius.] Hence, rotten thing, or I shall shake thy bones\nOut of thy garments.\n\nSICINIUS.\nHelp, ye citizens!\n\nEnter a rabble of Plebeians with the Aediles.\n\nMENENIUS.\nOn both sides more respect!\n\nSICINIUS.\nHere’s he that would take from you all your power.\n\nBRUTUS.\nSeize him, aediles.\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nDown with him, down with him!\n\nSECOND SENATOR.\nWeapons, weapons, weapons!\n\n[They all bustle about Coriolanus.]\n\nTribunes, patricians, citizens, what, ho!\nSicinius, Brutus, Coriolanus, citizens!\n\nALL.\nPeace, peace, peace! Stay, hold, peace!\n\nMENENIUS.\nWhat is about to be? I am out of breath.\nConfusion’s near. I cannot speak. You tribunes\nTo th’ people!—Coriolanus, patience!—\nSpeak, good Sicinius.\n\nSICINIUS.\nHear me, people! Peace!\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nLet’s hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.\n\nSICINIUS.\nYou are at point to lose your liberties.\nMartius would have all from you, Martius,\nWhom late you have named for consul.\n\nMENENIUS.\nFie, fie, fie!\nThis is the way to kindle, not to quench.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nTo unbuild the city and to lay all flat.\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhat is the city but the people?\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nTrue,\nThe people are the city.\n\nBRUTUS.\nBy the consent of all, we were established\nThe people’s magistrates.\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nYou so remain.\n\nMENENIUS.\nAnd so are like to do.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nThat is the way to lay the city flat,\nTo bring the roof to the foundation\nAnd bury all which yet distinctly ranges\nIn heaps and piles of ruin.\n\nSICINIUS.\nThis deserves death.\n\nBRUTUS.\nOr let us stand to our authority\nOr let us lose it. We do here pronounce,\nUpon the part o’ th’ people, in whose power\nWe were elected theirs, Martius is worthy\nOf present death.\n\nSICINIUS.\nTherefore lay hold of him,\nBear him to th’ rock Tarpeian, and from thence\nInto destruction cast him.\n\nBRUTUS.\nAediles, seize him!\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nYield, Martius, yield!\n\nMENENIUS.\nHear me one word.\nBeseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.\n\nAEDILES.\nPeace, peace!\n\nMENENIUS.\nBe that you seem, truly your country’s friend,\nAnd temp’rately proceed to what you would\nThus violently redress.\n\nBRUTUS.\nSir, those cold ways,\nThat seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous\nWhere the disease is violent.—Lay hands upon him,\nAnd bear him to the rock.\n\n[Coriolanus draws his sword.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nNo; I’ll die here.\nThere’s some among you have beheld me fighting.\nCome, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.\n\nMENENIUS.\nDown with that sword!—Tribunes, withdraw awhile.\n\nBRUTUS.\nLay hands upon him!\n\nMENENIUS.\nHelp Martius, help!\nYou that be noble, help him, young and old!\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nDown with him, down with him!\n\n[In this mutiny the Tribunes, the Aediles and the People are beat in.]\n\nMENENIUS.\nGo, get you to your house. Begone, away.\nAll will be naught else.\n\nSECOND SENATOR.\nGet you gone.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nStand fast!\nWe have as many friends as enemies.\n\nMENENIUS.\nShall it be put to that?\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nThe gods forbid!\nI prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;\nLeave us to cure this cause.\n\nMENENIUS.\nFor ’tis a sore upon us\nYou cannot tent yourself. Begone, beseech you.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nCome, sir, along with us.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI would they were barbarians, as they are,\nThough in Rome littered, not Romans, as they are not,\nThough calved i’ th’ porch o’ th’ Capitol.\n\nMENENIUS.\nBegone!\nPut not your worthy rage into your tongue.\nOne time will owe another.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nOn fair ground\nI could beat forty of them.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI could myself\nTake up a brace o’ th’ best of them, yea, the two tribunes.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nBut now ’tis odds beyond arithmetic,\nAnd manhood is called foolery when it stands\nAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,\nBefore the tag return, whose rage doth rend\nLike interrupted waters, and o’erbear\nWhat they are used to bear?\n\nMENENIUS.\nPray you, begone.\nI’ll try whether my old wit be in request\nWith those that have but little. This must be patched\nWith cloth of any colour.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nNay, come away.\n\n[Exeunt Coriolanus and Cominius.]\n\nPATRICIAN.\nThis man has marred his fortune.\n\nMENENIUS.\nHis nature is too noble for the world.\nHe would not flatter Neptune for his trident\nOr Jove for’s power to thunder. His heart’s his mouth;\nWhat his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,\nAnd, being angry, does forget that ever\nHe heard the name of death.\n\n[A noise within.]\n\nHere’s goodly work.\n\nPATRICIAN.\nI would they were abed!\n\nMENENIUS.\nI would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance,\nCould he not speak ’em fair?\n\nEnter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble again.\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhere is this viper\nThat would depopulate the city and\nBe every man himself?\n\nMENENIUS.\nYou worthy tribunes—\n\nSICINIUS.\nHe shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock\nWith rigorous hands. He hath resisted law,\nAnd therefore law shall scorn him further trial\nThan the severity of the public power\nWhich he so sets at naught.\n\nFIRST CITIZEN.\nHe shall well know\nThe noble tribunes are the people’s mouths,\nAnd we their hands.\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nHe shall, sure on’t.\n\nMENENIUS.\nSir, sir—\n\nSICINIUS.\nPeace!\n\nMENENIUS.\nDo not cry havoc where you should but hunt\nWith modest warrant.\n\nSICINIUS.\nSir, how comes’t that you\nHave holp to make this rescue?\n\nMENENIUS.\nHear me speak.\nAs I do know the Consul’s worthiness,\nSo can I name his faults.\n\nSICINIUS.\nConsul? What consul?\n\nMENENIUS.\nThe consul Coriolanus.\n\nBRUTUS.\nHe consul?\n\nALL PLEBEIANS.\nNo, no, no, no, no!\n\nMENENIUS.\nIf, by the Tribunes’ leave, and yours, good people,\nI may be heard, I would crave a word or two,\nThe which shall turn you to no further harm\nThan so much loss of time.\n\nSICINIUS.\nSpeak briefly then,\nFor we are peremptory to dispatch\nThis viperous traitor. To eject him hence\nWere but one danger, and to keep him here\nOur certain death. Therefore it is decreed\nHe dies tonight.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNow the good gods forbid\nThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitude\nTowards her deserved children is enrolled\nIn Jove’s own book, like an unnatural dam\nShould now eat up her own.\n\nSICINIUS.\nHe’s a disease that must be cut away.\n\nMENENIUS.\nO, he’s a limb that has but a disease—\nMortal to cut it off; to cure it easy.\nWhat has he done to Rome that’s worthy death?\nKilling our enemies, the blood he hath lost—\nWhich I dare vouch is more than that he hath\nBy many an ounce—he dropt it for his country;\nAnd what is left, to lose it by his country\nWere to us all, that do’t and suffer it\nA brand to th’ end o’ th’ world.\n\nSICINIUS.\nThis is clean cam.\n\nBRUTUS.\nMerely awry. When he did love his country,\nIt honoured him.\n\nMENENIUS.\nThe service of the foot,\nBeing once gangrened, is not then respected\nFor what before it was.\n\nBRUTUS.\nWe’ll hear no more.\nPursue him to his house, and pluck him thence,\nLest his infection, being of catching nature,\nSpread further.\n\nMENENIUS.\nOne word more, one word!\nThis tiger-footed rage, when it shall find\nThe harm of unscanned swiftness, will too late,\nTie leaden pounds to’s heels. Proceed by process,\nLest parties—as he is beloved—break out\nAnd sack great Rome with Romans.\n\nBRUTUS.\nIf it were so—\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhat do ye talk?\nHave we not had a taste of his obedience?\nOur aediles smote! Ourselves resisted? Come.\n\nMENENIUS.\nConsider this: he has been bred i’ th’ wars\nSince he could draw a sword, and is ill schooled\nIn bolted language; meal and bran together\nHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,\nI’ll go to him and undertake to bring him\nWhere he shall answer by a lawful form,\nIn peace, to his utmost peril.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nNoble tribunes,\nIt is the humane way: the other course\nWill prove too bloody, and the end of it\nUnknown to the beginning.\n\nSICINIUS.\nNoble Menenius,\nBe you then as the people’s officer.—\nMasters, lay down your weapons.\n\nBRUTUS.\nGo not home.\n\nSICINIUS.\nMeet on the marketplace. We’ll attend you there,\nWhere if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceed\nIn our first way.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI’ll bring him to you.\n[To Senators.] Let me desire your company. He must come,\nOr what is worst will follow.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nPray you, let’s to him.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

I cannot do it to the gods.\nMust I then do’t to them?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nYou are too absolute,\nThough therein you can never be too noble\nBut when extremities speak.

Grant that, and tell me\nIn peace what each of them by th’ other lose\nThat they combine not there.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nTush, tush!\n\nMENENIUS.\nA good demand.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nIf it be honour in your wars to seem\nThe same you are not, which for your best ends\nYou adopt your policy, how is it less or worse\nThat it shall hold companionship in peace\nWith honour as in war, since that to both\nIt stands in like request?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhy force you this?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nBecause that now it lies you on to speak\nTo th’ people, not by your own instruction,\nNor by th’ matter which your heart prompts you,\nBut with such words that are but rooted in\nYour tongue, though but bastards and syllables\nOf no allowance to your bosom’s truth.\nNow, this no more dishonours you at all\nThan to take in a town with gentle words,\nWhich else would put you to your fortune and\nThe hazard of much blood.\nI would dissemble with my nature where\nMy fortunes and my friends at stake required\nI should do so in honour. I am in this\nYour wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;\nAnd you will rather show our general louts\nHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon ’em\nFor the inheritance of their loves and safeguard\nOf what that want might ruin.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNoble lady!—\nCome, go with us; speak fair. You may salve so,\nNot what is dangerous present, but the loss\nOf what is past.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nI prithee now, my son,\nGo to them with this bonnet in thy hand,\nAnd thus far having stretched it—here be with them—\nThy knee bussing the stones—for in such busines\nAction is eloquence, and the eyes of th’ ignorant\nMore learned than the ears—waving thy head,\nWhich often thus correcting thy stout heart,\nNow humble as the ripest mulberry\nThat will not hold the handling. Or say to them\nThou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,\nHast not the soft way, which thou dost confess\nWere fit for thee to use, as they to claim,\nIn asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame\nThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far\nAs thou hast power and person.\n\nMENENIUS.\nThis but done\nEven as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;\nFor they have pardons, being asked, as free\nAs words to little purpose.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nPrithee now,\nGo, and be ruled; although I know thou hadst rather\nFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulf\nThan flatter him in a bower.\n\nEnter Cominius.\n\nHere is Cominius.\n\nCOMINIUS.\nI have been i’ th’ marketplace; and, sir, ’tis fit\nYou make strong party or defend yourself\nBy calmness or by absence.

The smiles of knaves\nTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys’ tears take up\nThe glasses of my sight! A beggar’s tongue\nMake motion through my lips, and my armed knees,\nWho bowed but in my stirrup, bend like his\nThat hath received an alms! I will not do’t,\nLest I surcease to honour mine own truth\nAnd, by my body’s action, teach my mind\nA most inherent baseness.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nAt thy choice, then.\nTo beg of thee, it is my more dishonour\nThan thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let\nThy mother rather feel thy pride than fear\nThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death\nWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.\nThy valiantness was mine; thou suck’dst it from me,\nBut owe thy pride thyself.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nPray, be content.\nMother, I am going to the marketplace.\nChide me no more. I’ll mountebank their loves,\nCog their hearts from them, and come home beloved\nOf all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.\nCommend me to my wife. I’ll return consul,\nOr never trust to what my tongue can do\nI’ th’ way of flattery further.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nDo your will.\n\n[Exit Volumnia.]\n\nCOMINIUS.\nAway! The Tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself\nTo answer mildly, for they are prepared\nWith accusations, as I hear, more strong\nThan are upon you yet.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThe word is “mildly.” Pray you, let us go.\nLet them accuse me by invention, I\nWill answer in mine honour.\n\nMENENIUS.\nAy, but mildly.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWell, mildly be it, then. Mildly.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Though thy tackle’s torn,\nThou show’st a noble vessel. What’s thy name?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nPrepare thy brow to frown. Know’st thou me yet?\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nI know thee not. Thy name?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nMy name is Caius Martius, who hath done\nTo thee particularly and to all the Volsces\nGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness may\nMy surname Coriolanus. The painful service,\nThe extreme dangers, and the drops of blood\nShed for my thankless country are requited\nBut with that surname, a good memory\nAnd witness of the malice and displeasure\nWhich thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains.\nThe cruelty and envy of the people,\nPermitted by our dastard nobles, who\nHave all forsook me, hath devoured the rest,\nAnd suffered me by th’ voice of slaves to be\nWhooped out of Rome. Now this extremity\nHath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope—\nMistake me not—to save my life; for if\nI had feared death, of all the men i’ th’ world\nI would have ’voided thee, but in mere spite,\nTo be full quit of those my banishers,\nStand I before thee here. Then if thou hast\nA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge\nThine own particular wrongs and stop those maims\nOf shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight\nAnd make my misery serve thy turn. So use it\nThat my revengeful services may prove\nAs benefits to thee, for I will fight\nAgainst my cankered country with the spleen\nOf all the under fiends. But if so be\nThou dar’st not this, and that to prove more fortunes\nThou ’rt tired, then, in a word, I also am\nLonger to live most weary, and present\nMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice,\nWhich not to cut would show thee but a fool,\nSince I have ever followed thee with hate,\nDrawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast,\nAnd cannot live but to thy shame, unless\nIt be to do thee service.\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nO Martius, Martius,\nEach word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart\nA root of ancient envy. If Jupiter\nShould from yond cloud speak divine things\nAnd say ’tis true, I’d not believe them more\nThan thee, all-noble Martius. Let me twine\nMine arms about that body, whereagainst\nMy grained ash an hundred times hath broke\nAnd scarred the moon with splinters. Here I clip\nThe anvil of my sword and do contest\nAs hotly and as nobly with thy love\nAs ever in ambitious strength I did\nContend against thy valour. Know thou first,\nI loved the maid I married; never man\nSighed truer breath. But that I see thee here,\nThou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart\nThan when I first my wedded mistress saw\nBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell thee\nWe have a power on foot, and I had purpose\nOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn\nOr lose mine arm for’t. Thou hast beat me out\nTwelve several times, and I have nightly since\nDreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me;\nWe have been down together in my sleep,\nUnbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat,\nAnd waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,\nHad we no other quarrel else to Rome but that\nThou art thence banished, we would muster all\nFrom twelve to seventy and, pouring war\nInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,\nLike a bold flood o’erbear ’t. O, come, go in,\nAnd take our friendly senators by th’ hands,\nWho now are here, taking their leaves of me,\nWho am prepared against your territories,\nThough not for Rome itself.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nYou bless me, gods!\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nTherefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have\nThe leading of thine own revenges, take\nTh’ one half of my commission and set down—\nAs best thou art experienced, since thou know’st\nThy country’s strength and weakness—thine own ways,\nWhether to knock against the gates of Rome,\nOr rudely visit them in parts remote\nTo fright them ere destroy. But come in.\nLet me commend thee first to those that shall\nSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!\nAnd more a friend than e’er an enemy—\nYet, Martius, that was much. Your hand. Most welcome!\n\n[Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius.]\n\nTwo of the Servingmen come forward.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nHere’s a strange alteration!\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nBy my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel, and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nWhat an arm he has! He turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nNay, I knew by his face that there was something in him. He had, sir, a kind of face, methought—I cannot tell how to term it.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nHe had so, looking as it were—Would I were hanged, but I thought there was more in him than I could think.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nSo did I, I’ll be sworn. He is simply the rarest man i’ th’ world.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nI think he is. But a greater soldier than he you wot one.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nWho, my master?\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nNay, it’s no matter for that.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nWorth six on him.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nNay, not so neither. But I take him to be the greater soldier.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nFaith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that. For the defence of a town our general is excellent.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nAy, and for an assault too.\n\nEnter the Third Servingman.\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nO slaves, I can tell you news, news, you rascals!\n\nFIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN.\nWhat, what, what? Let’s partake.\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nI would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as lief be a condemned man.\n\nFIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN.\nWherefore? Wherefore?\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nWhy, here’s he that was wont to thwack our general, Caius Martius.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nWhy do you say, “thwack our general”?\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nI do not say “thwack our general,” but he was always good enough for him.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nCome, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nHe was too hard for him directly, to say the troth on’t, before Corioles; he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nAn he had been cannibally given, he might have boiled and eaten him too.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nBut, more of thy news?\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nWhy, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o’ th’ table; no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself with’s hand, and turns up the white o’ th’ eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i’ th’ middle and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He’ll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th’ ears. He will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nAnd he’s as like to do’t as any man I can imagine.\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nDo’t? He will do’t! For look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies, which friends, sir, as it were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as we term it, his friends whilest he’s in directitude.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nDirectitude? What’s that?\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nBut when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows like coneys after rain, and revel all with him.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nBut when goes this forward?\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nTomorrow, today, presently. You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon. ’Tis as it were parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\nWhy then, we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nLet me have war, say I. It exceeds peace as far as day does night. It’s sprightly walking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war’s a destroyer of men.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN.\n’Tis so, and as war in some sort, may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN.\nAy, and it makes men hate one another.\n\nTHIRD SERVINGMAN.\nReason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money! I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians. They are rising; they are rising.\n\nALL.\nIn, in, in, in!\n\n[Exeunt.]",

So our virtues\nLie in th’ interpretation of the time,\nAnd power, unto itself most commendable,\nHath not a tomb so evident as a chair\nT’ extol what it hath done.\nOne fire drives out one fire, one nail one nail;\nRights by rights falter; strengths by strengths do fail.\nCome, let’s away.

Yet to bite his lip\nAnd hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.\nHe was not taken well; he had not dined.\nThe veins unfilled, our blood is cold, and then\nWe pout upon the morning, are unapt\nTo give or to forgive; but when we have stuffed\nThese pipes and these conveyances of our blood\nWith wine and feeding, we have suppler souls\nThan in our priestlike fasts.

I kneeled before him;\n’Twas very faintly he said “Rise”; dismissed me\nThus with his speechless hand. What he would do\nHe sent in writing after me; what he\nWould not, bound with an oath to yield to his\nConditions. So that all hope is vain\nUnless his noble mother and his wife,\nWho, as I hear, mean to solicit him\nFor mercy to his country.

Nay, sometimes,\nLike to a bowl upon a subtle ground,\nI have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise\nHave almost stamped the leasing. Therefore, fellow,\nI must have leave to pass.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nFaith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.\n\nMENENIUS.\nPrithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nHowsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore go back.\n\nMENENIUS.\nHas he dined, can’st thou tell? For I would not speak with him till after dinner.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nYou are a Roman, are you?\n\nMENENIUS.\nI am, as thy general is.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nThen you should hate Rome as he does. Can you, when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them, and, in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived. Therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemned. Our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.\n\nMENENIUS.\nSirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me with estimation.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nCome, my captain knows you not.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI mean thy general.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nMy general cares not for you. Back, I say, go, lest I let forth your half pint of blood. Back! That’s the utmost of your having. Back!\n\nMENENIUS.\nNay, but fellow, fellow—\n\nEnter Coriolanus with Aufidius.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nMENENIUS.\nNow, you companion, I’ll say an errand for you. You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand’st not i’ th’ state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what’s to come upon thee. [to Coriolanus.] The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son! Thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here’s water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here, this, who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nAway!\n\nMENENIUS.\nHow? Away?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs\nAre servanted to others. Though I owe\nMy revenge properly, my remission lies\nIn Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,\nIngrate forgetfulness shall poison rather\nThan pity note how much. Therefore begone.\nMine ears against your suits are stronger than\nYour gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,\nTake this along; I writ it for thy sake,\n\n[He gives Menenius a paper.]\n\nAnd would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,\nI will not hear thee speak.—This man, Aufidius,\nWas my beloved in Rome; yet thou behold’st.\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nYou keep a constant temper.\n\n[They exit.]\n\n[The Guard and Menenius remain.]\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nNow, sir, is your name Menenius?\n\nSECOND WATCH.\n’Tis a spell, you see, of much power. You know the way home again.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nDo you hear how we are shent for keeping your Greatness back?\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nWhat cause do you think I have to swoon?\n\nMENENIUS.\nI neither care for th’ world nor your general. For such things as you, I can scarce think there’s any, you’re so slight. He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another. Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was said to, away!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nA noble fellow, I warrant him.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nThe worthy fellow is our general. He is the rock, the oak not to be wind-shaken.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus\nEnter Coriolanus and Aufidius.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWe will before the walls of Rome tomorrow\nSet down our host. My partner in this action,\nYou must report to th’ Volscian lords how plainly\nI have borne this business.\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nOnly their ends\nYou have respected, stopped your ears against\nThe general suit of Rome; never admitted\nA private whisper, no, not with such friends\nThat thought them sure of you.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThis last old man,\nWhom with cracked heart I have sent to Rome,\nLoved me above the measure of a father,\nNay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge\nWas to send him, for whose old love I have—\nThough I showed sourly to him—once more offered\nThe first conditions, which they did refuse\nAnd cannot now accept, to grace him only\nThat thought he could do more. A very little\nI have yielded to. Fresh embassies and suits,\nNor from the state nor private friends, hereafter\nWill I lend ear to.\n\n[Shout within.]\n\nHa? What shout is this?\nShall I be tempted to infringe my vow\nIn the same time ’tis made? I will not.\n\nEnter Virgilia, Volumnia, Valeria, young Martius with attendants.\n\nMy wife comes foremost, then the honoured mold\nWherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand\nThe grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!\nAll bond and privilege of nature, break!\nLet it be virtuous to be obstinate.\nWhat is that curtsy worth? Or those doves’ eyes,\nWhich can make gods forsworn? I melt and am not\nOf stronger earth than others. My mother bows,\nAs if Olympus to a molehill should\nIn supplication nod; and my young boy\nHath an aspect of intercession which\nGreat Nature cries “Deny not!” Let the Volsces\nPlough Rome and harrow Italy, I’ll never\nBe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand\nAs if a man were author of himself,\nAnd knew no other kin.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nMy lord and husband.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThese eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nThe sorrow that delivers us thus changed\nMakes you think so.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nLike a dull actor now,\nI have forgot my part, and I am out,\nEven to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,\nForgive my tyranny, but do not say\nFor that, “Forgive our Romans.”\n\n[They kiss.]\n\nO, a kiss\nLong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!\nNow, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss\nI carried from thee, dear, and my true lip\nHath virgined it e’er since. You gods! I prate\nAnd the most noble mother of the world\nLeave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i’ th’ earth;\n\n[Kneels.]\n\nOf thy deep duty more impression show\nThan that of common sons.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nO, stand up blest,\n\n[He rises.]\n\nWhilst with no softer cushion than the flint\nI kneel before thee and unproperly\nShow duty, as mistaken all this while\nBetween the child and parent.\n\n[She kneels.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nWhat is this?\nYour knees to me? To your corrected son?\n\n[He raises her up.]\n\nThen let the pebbles on the hungry beach\nFillip the stars! Then let the mutinous winds\nStrike the proud cedars ’gainst the fiery sun,\nMurdering impossibility to make\nWhat cannot be slight work.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nThou art my warrior;\nI holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThe noble sister of Publicola,\nThe moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle\nThat’s curdied by the frost from purest snow\nAnd hangs on Dian’s temple!—Dear Valeria.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nThis is a poor epitome of yours,\nWhich by th’ interpretation of full time\nMay show like all yourself.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThe god of soldiers,\nWith the consent of supreme Jove, inform\nThy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove\nTo shame unvulnerable, and stick i’ th’ wars\nLike a great seamark standing every flaw\nAnd saving those that eye thee.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\n[To young Martius.] Your knee, sirrah.\n\n[He kneels.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nThat’s my brave boy!\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nEven he, your wife, this lady, and myself\nAre suitors to you.\n\n[Young Martius rises.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI beseech you, peace;\nOr, if you’d ask, remember this before:\nThe thing I have forsworn to grant may never\nBe held by you denials. Do not bid me\nDismiss my soldiers or capitulate\nAgain with Rome’s mechanics. Tell me not\nWherein I seem unnatural; desire not\nT’ allay my rages and revenges with\nYour colder reasons.\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nO, no more, no more!\nYou have said you will not grant us anything;\nFor we have nothing else to ask but that\nWhich you deny already. Yet we will ask,\nThat if you fail in our request, the blame\nMay hang upon your hardness. Therefore hear us.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nAufidius, and you Volsces, mark, for we’ll\nHear naught from Rome in private. Your request?\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nShould we be silent and not speak, our raiment\nAnd state of bodies would bewray what life\nWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyself\nHow more unfortunate than all living women\nAre we come hither; since that thy sight, which should\nMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,\nConstrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,\nMaking the mother, wife, and child to see\nThe son, the husband, and the father tearing\nHis country’s bowels out. And to poor we\nThine enmity’s most capital. Thou barr’st us\nOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfort\nThat all but we enjoy. For how can we—\nAlas, how can we—for our country pray,\nWhereto we are bound, together with thy victory,\nWhereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose\nThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,\nOur comfort in the country. We must find\nAn evident calamity, though we had\nOur wish, which side should win, for either thou\nMust as a foreign recreant be led\nWith manacles through our streets, or else\nTriumphantly tread on thy country’s ruin\nAnd bear the palm for having bravely shed\nThy wife and children’s blood. For myself, son,\nI purpose not to wait on fortune till\nThese wars determine. If I cannot persuade thee\nRather to show a noble grace to both parts\nThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner\nMarch to assault thy country than to tread—\nTrust to’t, thou shalt not—on thy mother’s womb\nThat brought thee to this world.\n\nVIRGILIA.\nAy, and mine,\nThat brought you forth this boy to keep your name\nLiving to time.\n\nYOUNG MARTIUS.\nHe shall not tread on me.\nI’ll run away till I am bigger, but then I’ll fight.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nNot of a woman’s tenderness to be\nRequires nor child nor woman’s face to see.—\nI have sat too long.\n\n[He rises.]\n\nVOLUMNIA.\nNay, go not from us thus.\nIf it were so, that our request did tend\nTo save the Romans, thereby to destroy\nThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us\nAs poisonous of your honour. No, our suit\nIs that you reconcile them, while the Volsces\nMay say “This mercy we have showed,” the Romans\n“This we received,” and each in either side\nGive the all-hail to thee and cry, “Be blessed\nFor making up this peace!” Thou know’st, great son,\nThe end of war’s uncertain, but this certain,\nThat, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\nWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name\nWhose repetition will be dogged with curses,\nWhose chronicle thus writ: “The man was noble,\nBut with his last attempt he wiped it out;\nDestroyed his country, and his name remains\nTo th’ ensuing age abhorred.” Speak to me, son.\nThou hast affected the fine strains of honour\nTo imitate the graces of the gods,\nTo tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ th’ air\nAnd yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\nThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?\nThink’st thou it honourable for a noble man\nStill to remember wrongs?—Daughter, speak you.\nHe cares not for your weeping.—Speak thou, boy.\nPerhaps thy childishness will move him more\nThan can our reasons.—There’s no man in the world\nMore bound to’s mother, yet here he lets me prate\nLike one i’ th’ stocks. Thou hast never in thy life\nShowed thy dear mother any courtesy\nWhen she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\nHas clucked thee to the wars and safely home,\nLoaden with honour. Say my request’s unjust\nAnd spurn me back; but if it be not so,\nThou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee\nThat thou restrain’st from me the duty which\nTo a mother’s part belongs.—He turns away.—\nDown, ladies! Let us shame him with our knees.\nTo his surname Coriolanus ’longs more pride\nThan pity to our prayers. Down! An end.\n\n[They kneel.]\n\nThis is the last. So we will home to Rome\nAnd die among our neighbours.—Nay, behold’s.\nThis boy that cannot tell what he would have,\nBut kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,\nDoes reason our petition with more strength\nThan thou hast to deny’t.—Come, let us go.\n\n[They rise.]\n\nThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother,\nHis wife is in Corioles, and his child\nLike him by chance.—Yet give us our dispatch.\nI am hushed until our city be afire,\nAnd then I’ll speak a little.\n\n[He holds her by the hand, silent.]\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nO mother, mother!\nWhat have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,\nThe gods look down, and this unnatural scene\nThey laugh at. O my mother, mother, O!\nYou have won a happy victory to Rome,\nBut, for your son—believe it, O, believe it!—\nMost dangerously you have with him prevailed,\nIf not most mortal to him. But let it come.—\nAufidius, though I cannot make true wars,\nI’ll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,\nWere you in my stead, would you have heard\nA mother less? Or granted less, Aufidius?\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nI was moved withal.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nI dare be sworn you were.\nAnd, sir, it is no little thing to make\nMine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,\nWhat peace you’ll make, advise me. For my part,\nI’ll not to Rome, I’ll back with you; and pray you,\nStand to me in this cause.—O mother!—Wife!\n\n[He speaks with them aside.]\n\nAUFIDIUS.\n[Aside.] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour\nAt difference in thee. Out of that I’ll work\nMyself a former fortune.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\n[To the Women.] Ay, by and by;\nBut we’ll drink together, and you shall bear\nA better witness back than words, which we,\nOn like conditions, will have countersealed.\nCome, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve\nTo have a temple built you. All the swords\nIn Italy, and her confederate arms,\nCould not have made this peace.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A public place\nEnter Menenius and Sicinius.\n\nMENENIUS.\nSee you yond coign o’ the Capitol, yond cornerstone?\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhy, what of that?\n\nMENENIUS.\nIf it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in’t. Our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution.\n\nSICINIUS.\nIs’t possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man?\n\nMENENIUS.\nThere is differency between a grub and a butterfly, yet your butterfly was a grub. This Martius is grown from man to dragon. He has wings; he’s more than a creeping thing.\n\nSICINIUS.\nHe loved his mother dearly.\n\nMENENIUS.\nSo did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes. When he walks, he moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in.\n\nSICINIUS.\nYes, mercy, if you report him truly.\n\nMENENIUS.\nI paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger. That shall our poor city find, and all this is long of you.\n\nSICINIUS.\nThe gods be good unto us.\n\nMENENIUS.\nNo, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us. When we banished him, we respected not them; and he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nSir, if you’d save your life, fly to your house.\nThe plebeians have got your fellow tribune\nAnd hale him up and down, all swearing if\nThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,\nThey’ll give him death by inches.\n\nEnter another Messenger.\n\nSICINIUS.\nWhat’s the news?\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nGood news, good news! The ladies have prevailed.\nThe Volscians are dislodged and Martius gone.\nA merrier day did never yet greet Rome,\nNo, not th’ expulsion of the Tarquins.\n\nSICINIUS.\nFriend,\nArt thou certain this is true? Is’t most certain?\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nAs certain as I know the sun is fire.\nWhere have you lurked that you make doubt of it?\nNe’er through an arch so hurried the blown tide\nAs the recomforted through th’ gates. Why, hark you!\n\n[Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together.]\n\nThe trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,\nTabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans\nMake the sun dance. Hark you!\n\n[A shout within.]\n\nMENENIUS.\nThis is good news.\nI will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia\nIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians\nA city full; of tribunes such as you\nA sea and land full. You have prayed well today.\nThis morning for ten thousand of your throats\nI’d not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!\n\n[Sound still with the shouts.]\n\nSICINIUS.\nFirst, the gods bless you for your tidings; next, accept my thankfulness.\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nSir, we have all great cause to give great thanks.\n\nSICINIUS.\nThey are near the city?\n\nMESSENGER.\nAlmost at point to enter.\n\nSICINIUS.\nWe’ll meet them, and help the joy.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

You are to know\nThat prosperously I have attempted, and\nWith bloody passage led your wars even to\nThe gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home\nDoth more than counterpoise a full third part\nThe charges of the action.

O slave!—\nPardon me, lords, ’tis the first time that ever\nI was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,\nMust give this cur the lie; and his own notion—\nWho wears my stripes impressed upon him, that\nMust bear my beating to his grave—shall join\nTo thrust the lie unto him.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nPeace, both, and hear me speak.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nCut me to pieces, Volsces. Men and lads,\nStain all your edges on me. “Boy”? False hound!\nIf you have writ your annals true, ’tis there,\nThat like an eagle in a dovecote, I\nFluttered your Volscians in Corioles,\nAlone I did it. “Boy”!\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nWhy, noble lords,\nWill you be put in mind of his blind fortune,\nWhich was your shame, by this unholy braggart,\n’Fore your own eyes and ears?\n\nALL CONSPIRATORS.\nLet him die for’t.\n\nALL PEOPLE\nTear him to pieces! Do it presently! He killed my son! My daughter! He killed my cousin Marcus! He killed my father!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nPeace, ho! No outrage! Peace!\nThe man is noble, and his fame folds in\nThis orb o’ th’ Earth. His last offences to us\nShall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,\nAnd trouble not the peace.\n\nCORIOLANUS.\nO that I had him,\nWith six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,\nTo use my lawful sword.\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nInsolent villain!\n\nALL CONSPIRATORS.\nKill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!\n\n[Draw the Conspirators, and kills Martius, who falls. Aufidius stands on him.]\n\nLORDS.\nHold, hold, hold, hold!\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nMy noble masters, hear me speak.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO Tullus!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.\n\nTHIRD LORD.\nTread not upon him.—Masters, all be quiet.—\nPut up your swords.\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nMy lords, when you shall know—as in this rage,\nProvoked by him, you cannot—the great danger\nWhich this man’s life did owe you, you’ll rejoice\nThat he is thus cut off. Please it your Honours\nTo call me to your senate, I’ll deliver\nMyself your loyal servant, or endure\nYour heaviest censure.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBear from hence his body,\nAnd mourn you for him. Let him be regarded\nAs the most noble corse that ever herald\nDid follow to his urn.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHis own impatience\nTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.\nLet’s make the best of it.\n\nAUFIDIUS.\nMy rage is gone,\nAnd I am struck with sorrow.—Take him up.\nHelp, three o’ th’ chiefest soldiers; I’ll be one.—\nBeat thou the drum that it speak mournfully.—\nTrail your steel pikes. Though in this city he\nHath widowed and unchilded many a one,\nWhich to this hour bewail the injury,\nYet he shall have a noble memory.\nAssist.\n\n[Exeunt, bearing the body of Martius. A dead march sounded.]",
