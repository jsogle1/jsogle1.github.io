Nay, and most like.\nYou must not stay here longer; your dismission\nIs come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.\nWhere’s Fulvia’s process?—Caesar’s I would say? Both?\nCall in the messengers.

Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!\n\nIRAS.\nAmen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum and fortune him accordingly!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nAmen.\n\nALEXAS.\nLo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores but they’d do’t!\n\nEnter Cleopatra.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHush, Here comes Antony.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNot he, the queen.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSaw you my lord?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNo, lady.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWas he not here?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nNo, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden\nA Roman thought hath struck him.

My lord approaches.\n\nEnter Antony with a Messenger.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWe will not look upon him. Go with us.\n\n[Exeunt Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas and Soothsayer.]\n\nMESSENGER.\nFulvia thy wife first came into the field.\n\nANTONY.\nAgainst my brother Lucius.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAy.\nBut soon that war had end, and the time’s state\nMade friends of them, jointing their force ’gainst Caesar,\nWhose better issue in the war from Italy\nUpon the first encounter drave them.\n\nANTONY.\nWell, what worst?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe nature of bad news infects the teller.\n\nANTONY.\nWhen it concerns the fool or coward.

O, then we bring forth weeds\nWhen our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us\nIs as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAt your noble pleasure.\n\n[Exit Messenger.]\n\nEnter another Messenger.\n\nANTONY.\nFrom Sicyon, ho, the news? Speak there!\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nThe man from Sicyon—\n\nANTONY.\nIs there such a one?\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nHe stays upon your will.\n\nANTONY.\nLet him appear.\n[Exit second Messenger.]\n\nThese strong Egyptian fetters I must break,\nOr lose myself in dotage.\n\nEnter another Messenger with a letter.\n\nWhat are you?\n\nTHIRD MESSENGER.\nFulvia thy wife is dead.\n\nANTONY.\nWhere died she?\n\nTHIRD MESSENGER.\nIn Sicyon:\nHer length of sickness, with what else more serious\nImporteth thee to know, this bears.\n\n[Gives a letter.]\n\nANTONY.\nForbear me.\n\n[Exit third Messenger.]\n\nThere’s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.\nWhat our contempts doth often hurl from us,\nWe wish it ours again. The present pleasure,\nBy revolution lowering, does become\nThe opposite of itself. She’s good, being gone.\nThe hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.\nI must from this enchanting queen break off.\nTen thousand harms, more than the ills I know,\nMy idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!\n\nEnter Enobarbus.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhat’s your pleasure, sir?\n\nANTONY.\nI must with haste from hence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhy then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them. If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.\n\nANTONY.\nI must be gone.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nUnder a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though, between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly. I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.\n\nANTONY.\nShe is cunning past man’s thought.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAlack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove.\n\nANTONY.\nWould I had never seen her!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nO, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.\n\nANTONY.\nFulvia is dead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nSir?\n\nANTONY.\nFulvia is dead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nFulvia?\n\nANTONY.\nDead.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhy, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.\n\nANTONY.\nThe business she hath broached in the state\nCannot endure my absence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAnd the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.\n\nANTONY.\nNo more light answers. Let our officers\nHave notice what we purpose. I shall break\nThe cause of our expedience to the Queen,\nAnd get her leave to part. For not alone\nThe death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,\nDo strongly speak to us, but the letters too\nOf many our contriving friends in Rome\nPetition us at home. Sextus Pompeius\nHath given the dare to Caesar, and commands\nThe empire of the sea. Our slippery people,\nWhose love is never linked to the deserver\nTill his deserts are past, begin to throw\nPompey the Great and all his dignities\nUpon his son, who, high in name and power,\nHigher than both in blood and life, stands up\nFor the main soldier; whose quality, going on,\nThe sides o’ th’ world may danger. Much is breeding\nWhich, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life\nAnd not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure\nTo such whose place is under us, requires\nOur quick remove from hence.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall do’t.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Riotous madness,\nTo be entangled with those mouth-made vows\nWhich break themselves in swearing!\n\nANTONY.\nMost sweet queen—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, pray you seek no colour for your going,\nBut bid farewell and go. When you sued staying,\nThen was the time for words. No going then,\nEternity was in our lips and eyes,\nBliss in our brows’ bent; none our parts so poor\nBut was a race of heaven. They are so still,\nOr thou, the greatest soldier of the world,\nArt turned the greatest liar.\n\nANTONY.\nHow now, lady!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know\nThere were a heart in Egypt.\n\nANTONY.\nHear me, queen:\nThe strong necessity of time commands\nOur services awhile, but my full heart\nRemains in use with you. Our Italy\nShines o’er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius\nMakes his approaches to the port of Rome;\nEquality of two domestic powers\nBreed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,\nAre newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey,\nRich in his father’s honour, creeps apace\nInto the hearts of such as have not thrived\nUpon the present state, whose numbers threaten;\nAnd quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge\nBy any desperate change. My more particular,\nAnd that which most with you should safe my going,\nIs Fulvia’s death.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThough age from folly could not give me freedom,\nIt does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?\n\nANTONY.\nShe’s dead, my queen.\nLook here, and at thy sovereign leisure read\nThe garboils she awaked; at the last, best,\nSee when and where she died.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO most false love!\nWhere be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill\nWith sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,\nIn Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be.\n\nANTONY.\nQuarrel no more, but be prepared to know\nThe purposes I bear; which are, or cease,\nAs you shall give th’ advice. By the fire\nThat quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence\nThy soldier, servant, making peace or war\nAs thou affects.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCut my lace, Charmian, come!\nBut let it be; I am quickly ill and well,\nSo Antony loves.\n\nANTONY.\nMy precious queen, forbear,\nAnd give true evidence to his love, which stands\nAn honourable trial.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSo Fulvia told me.\nI prithee, turn aside and weep for her,\nThen bid adieu to me, and say the tears\nBelong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene\nOf excellent dissembling, and let it look\nLike perfect honour.\n\nANTONY.\nYou’ll heat my blood. No more.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nYou can do better yet, but this is meetly.\n\nANTONY.\nNow, by my sword—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAnd target. Still he mends.\nBut this is not the best.

Something it is I would—\nO, my oblivion is a very Antony,\nAnd I am all forgotten.\n\nANTONY.\nBut that your royalty\nHolds idleness your subject, I should take you\nFor idleness itself.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\n’Tis sweating labour\nTo bear such idleness so near the heart\nAs Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,\nSince my becomings kill me when they do not\nEye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;\nTherefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,\nAnd all the gods go with you! Upon your sword\nSit laurel victory, and smooth success\nBe strewed before your feet!\n\nANTONY.\nLet us go.

    "content":"SCENE IV. Rome. An Apartment in Caesar’s House.\nEnter Octavius [Caesar], Lepidus and their train.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\nIt is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate\nOur great competitor. From Alexandria\nThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\nThe lamps of night in revel: is not more manlike\nThan Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy\nMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\nVouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there\nA man who is the abstract of all faults\nThat all men follow.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nI must not think there are\nEvils enough to darken all his goodness.\nHis faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\nMore fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary\nRather than purchased; what he cannot change\nThan what he chooses.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not\nAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,\nTo give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit\nAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave,\nTo reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\nWith knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him—\nAs his composure must be rare indeed\nWhom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony\nNo way excuse his foils when we do bear\nSo great weight in his lightness. If he filled\nHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,\nFull surfeits and the dryness of his bones\nCall on him for’t. But to confound such time\nThat drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\nAs his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid\nAs we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure\nAnd so rebel to judgment.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nHere’s more news.\n\nMESSENGER.\nThy biddings have been done, and every hour,\nMost noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\nHow ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,\nAnd it appears he is beloved of those\nThat only have feared Caesar. To the ports\nThe discontents repair, and men’s reports\nGive him much wronged.\n\nCAESAR.\nI should have known no less.\nIt hath been taught us from the primal state\nThat he which is was wished until he were,\nAnd the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love,\nComes deared by being lacked. This common body,\nLike to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\nGoes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\nTo rot itself with motion.\n\nEnter a second Messenger.\n\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nCaesar, I bring thee word\nMenecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\nMake the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\nWith keels of every kind. Many hot inroads\nThey make in Italy—the borders maritime\nLack blood to think on’t—and flush youth revolt.\nNo vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon\nTaken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more\nThan could his war resisted.\n\nCAESAR.\nAntony,\nLeave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\nWas beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st\nHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\nDid famine follow, whom thou fought’st against,\nThough daintily brought up, with patience more\nThan savages could suffer. Thou didst drink\nThe stale of horses and the gilded puddle\nWhich beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign\nThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge.\nYea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,\nThe barks of trees thou browsed. On the Alps\nIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh\nWhich some did die to look on. And all this—\nIt wounds thine honour that I speak it now—\nWas borne so like a soldier that thy cheek\nSo much as lanked not.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis pity of him.\n\nCAESAR.\nLet his shames quickly\nDrive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain\nDid show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end\nAssemble we immediate council. Pompey\nThrives in our idleness.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTomorrow, Caesar,\nI shall be furnished to inform you rightly\nBoth what by sea and land I can be able\nTo front this present time.\n\nCAESAR.\nTill which encounter\nIt is my business too. Farewell.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nFarewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime\nOf stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,\nTo let me be partaker.\n\nCAESAR.\nDoubt not, sir.\nI knew it for my bond.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Mark Antony\nIn Egypt sits at dinner, and will make\nNo wars without doors. Caesar gets money where\nHe loses hearts.

    "content":"SCENE II. Rome. A Room in the House of Lepidus.\nEnter Enobarbus and Lepidus.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nGood Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed,\nAnd shall become you well, to entreat your captain\nTo soft and gentle speech.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall entreat him\nTo answer like himself. If Caesar move him,\nLet Antony look over Caesar’s head\nAnd speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,\nWere I the wearer of Antonius’ beard,\nI would not shave’t today.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis not a time\nFor private stomaching.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nEvery time\nServes for the matter that is then born in’t.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nBut small to greater matters must give way.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNot if the small come first.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYour speech is passion;\nBut pray you stir no embers up. Here comes\nThe noble Antony.\n\nEnter Antony and Ventidius.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAnd yonder Caesar.\n\nEnter Caesar, Maecenas and Agrippa.\n\nANTONY.\nIf we compose well here, to Parthia.\nHark, Ventidius.\n\nCAESAR.\nI do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNoble friends,\nThat which combined us was most great, and let not\nA leaner action rend us. What’s amiss,\nMay it be gently heard. When we debate\nOur trivial difference loud, we do commit\nMurder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,\nThe rather for I earnestly beseech,\nTouch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,\nNor curstness grow to th’ matter.\n\nANTONY.\n’Tis spoken well.\nWere we before our armies, and to fight,\nI should do thus.\n\nCAESAR.\nWelcome to Rome.\n\nANTONY.\nThank you.\n\nCAESAR.\nSit.\n\nANTONY.\nSit, sir.\n\nCAESAR.\nNay, then.\n\nANTONY.\nI learn you take things ill which are not so,\nOr being, concern you not.\n\nCAESAR.\nI must be laughed at\nIf, or for nothing or a little, I\nShould say myself offended, and with you\nChiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at that I should\nOnce name you derogately when to sound your name\nIt not concerned me.\n\nANTONY.\nMy being in Egypt, Caesar,\nWhat was’t to you?\n\nCAESAR.\nNo more than my residing here at Rome\nMight be to you in Egypt. Yet if you there\nDid practise on my state, your being in Egypt\nMight be my question.\n\nANTONY.\nHow intend you, practised?\n\nCAESAR.\nYou may be pleased to catch at mine intent\nBy what did here befall me. Your wife and brother\nMade wars upon me, and their contestation\nWas theme for you; you were the word of war.\n\nANTONY.\nYou do mistake your business. My brother never\nDid urge me in his act. I did inquire it,\nAnd have my learning from some true reports\nThat drew their swords with you. Did he not rather\nDiscredit my authority with yours,\nAnd make the wars alike against my stomach,\nHaving alike your cause? Of this my letters\nBefore did satisfy you. If you’ll patch a quarrel,\nAs matter whole you have not to make it with,\nIt must not be with this.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou praise yourself\nBy laying defects of judgment to me; but\nYou patched up your excuses.\n\nANTONY.\nNot so, not so.\nI know you could not lack—I am certain on’t—\nVery necessity of this thought, that I,\nYour partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought,\nCould not with graceful eyes attend those wars\nWhich fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,\nI would you had her spirit in such another.\nThe third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle\nYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWould we had all such wives, that the men\nMight go to wars with the women.\n\nANTONY.\nSo much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,\nMade out of her impatience—which not wanted\nShrewdness of policy too—I grieving grant\nDid you too much disquiet. For that you must\nBut say I could not help it.\n\nCAESAR.\nI wrote to you\nWhen rioting in Alexandria; you\nDid pocket up my letters, and with taunts\nDid gibe my missive out of audience.\n\nANTONY.\nSir,\nHe fell upon me ere admitted, then.\nThree kings I had newly feasted, and did want\nOf what I was i’ th’ morning. But next day\nI told him of myself, which was as much\nAs to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow\nBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,\nOut of our question wipe him.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou have broken\nThe article of your oath, which you shall never\nHave tongue to charge me with.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nSoft, Caesar!\n\nANTONY.\nNo, Lepidus, let him speak.\nThe honour is sacred which he talks on now,\nSupposing that I lacked it. But on, Caesar:\nThe article of my oath?\n\nCAESAR.\nTo lend me arms and aid when I required them,\nThe which you both denied.\n\nANTONY.\nNeglected, rather;\nAnd then when poisoned hours had bound me up\nFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may\nI’ll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty\nShall not make poor my greatness, nor my power\nWork without it. Truth is that Fulvia,\nTo have me out of Egypt, made wars here,\nFor which myself, the ignorant motive, do\nSo far ask pardon as befits mine honour\nTo stoop in such a case.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis noble spoken.\n\nMAECENAS.\nIf it might please you to enforce no further\nThe griefs between ye; to forget them quite\nWere to remember that the present need\nSpeaks to atone you.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWorthily spoken, Maecenas.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nOr, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.\n\nANTONY.\nThou art a soldier only. Speak no more.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThat truth should be silent I had almost forgot.\n\nANTONY.\nYou wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nGo to, then. Your considerate stone!\n\nCAESAR.\nI do not much dislike the matter, but\nThe manner of his speech; for’t cannot be\nWe shall remain in friendship, our conditions\nSo differing in their acts. Yet if I knew\nWhat hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to edge\nO’ th’ world I would pursue it.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nGive me leave, Caesar.\n\nCAESAR.\nSpeak, Agrippa.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nThou hast a sister by the mother’s side,\nAdmired Octavia. Great Mark Antony\nIs now a widower.\n\nCAESAR.\nSay not so, Agrippa.\nIf Cleopatra heard you, your reproof\nWere well deserved of rashness.\n\nANTONY.\nI am not married, Caesar. Let me hear\nAgrippa further speak.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nTo hold you in perpetual amity,\nTo make you brothers, and to knit your hearts\nWith an unslipping knot, take Antony\nOctavia to his wife; whose beauty claims\nNo worse a husband than the best of men;\nWhose virtue and whose general graces speak\nThat which none else can utter. By this marriage\nAll little jealousies, which now seem great,\nAnd all great fears, which now import their dangers,\nWould then be nothing. Truths would be tales,\nWhere now half-tales be truths. Her love to both\nWould each to other, and all loves to both,\nDraw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,\nFor ’tis a studied, not a present thought,\nBy duty ruminated.\n\nANTONY.\nWill Caesar speak?\n\nCAESAR.\nNot till he hears how Antony is touched\nWith what is spoke already.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat power is in Agrippa,\nIf I would say “Agrippa, be it so,”\nTo make this good?\n\nCAESAR.\nThe power of Caesar, and\nHis power unto Octavia.\n\nANTONY.\nMay I never\nTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,\nDream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.\nFurther this act of grace; and from this hour\nThe heart of brothers govern in our loves\nAnd sway our great designs!\n\nCAESAR.\nThere’s my hand.\nA sister I bequeath you, whom no brother\nDid ever love so dearly. Let her live\nTo join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never\nFly off our loves again!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nHappily, amen!\n\nANTONY.\nI did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey,\nFor he hath laid strange courtesies and great\nOf late upon me. I must thank him only,\nLest my remembrance suffer ill report;\nAt heel of that, defy him.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nTime calls upon ’s.\nOf us must Pompey presently be sought,\nOr else he seeks out us.\n\nANTONY.\nWhere lies he?\n\nCAESAR.\nAbout the Mount Misena.\n\nANTONY.\nWhat is his strength by land?\n\nCAESAR.\nGreat and increasing; but by sea\nHe is an absolute master.\n\nANTONY.\nSo is the fame.\nWould we had spoke together! Haste we for it.\nYet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we\nThe business we have talked of.\n\nCAESAR.\nWith most gladness,\nAnd do invite you to my sister’s view,\nWhither straight I’ll lead you.\n\nANTONY.\nLet us, Lepidus, not lack your company.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNoble Antony, not sickness should detain me.\n\n[Flourish. Exeunt all except Enobarbus, Agrippa and Maecenas.]\n\nMAECENAS.\nWelcome from Egypt, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHalf the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable friend, Agrippa!\n\nAGRIPPA.\nGood Enobarbus!\n\nMAECENAS.\nWe have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by ’t in Egypt.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAy, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking.\n\nMAECENAS.\nEight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there. Is this true?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThis was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.\n\nMAECENAS.\nShe’s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWhen she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nThere she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI will tell you.\nThe barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,\nBurned on the water. The poop was beaten gold;\nPurple the sails, and so perfumed that\nThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,\nWhich to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\nThe water which they beat to follow faster,\nAs amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\nIt beggared all description: she did lie\nIn her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,\nO’erpicturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature. On each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-coloured fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nO, rare for Antony!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHer gentlewomen, like the Nereides,\nSo many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes,\nAnd made their bends adornings. At the helm\nA seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle\nSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands\nThat yarely frame the office. From the barge\nA strange invisible perfume hits the sense\nOf the adjacent wharfs. The city cast\nHer people out upon her, and Antony,\nEnthroned i’ th’ market-place, did sit alone,\nWhistling to th’ air, which, but for vacancy,\nHad gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,\nAnd made a gap in nature.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nRare Egyptian!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nUpon her landing, Antony sent to her,\nInvited her to supper. She replied\nIt should be better he became her guest,\nWhich she entreated. Our courteous Antony,\nWhom ne’er the word of “No” woman heard speak,\nBeing barbered ten times o’er, goes to the feast,\nAnd, for his ordinary, pays his heart\nFor what his eyes eat only.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nRoyal wench!\nShe made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.\nHe ploughed her, and she cropped.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI saw her once\nHop forty paces through the public street\nAnd, having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,\nThat she did make defect perfection,\nAnd, breathless, pour breath forth.\n\nMAECENAS.\nNow Antony must leave her utterly.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNever. He will not.\nAge cannot wither her, nor custom stale\nHer infinite variety. Other women cloy\nThe appetites they feed, but she makes hungry\nWhere most she satisfies. For vilest things\nBecome themselves in her, that the holy priests\nBless her when she is riggish.\n\nMAECENAS.\nIf beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle\nThe heart of Antony, Octavia is\nA blessed lottery to him.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nLet us go.\nGood Enobarbus, make yourself my guest\nWhilst you abide here.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHumbly, sir, I thank you.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

If not well,\nThou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes,\nNot like a formal man.\n\nMESSENGER.\nWill’t please you hear me?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st.\nYet if thou say Antony lives, is well,\nOr friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,\nI’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail\nRich pearls upon thee.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, he’s well.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell said.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAnd friends with Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nTh’ art an honest man.\n\nMESSENGER.\nCaesar and he are greater friends than ever.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMake thee a fortune from me.\n\nMESSENGER.\nBut yet, madam—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI do not like “But yet”, it does allay\nThe good precedence. Fie upon “But yet”!\n“But yet” is as a gaoler to bring forth\nSome monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,\nPour out the pack of matter to mine ear,\nThe good and bad together: he’s friends with Caesar,\nIn state of health, thou say’st; and, thou say’st, free.\n\nMESSENGER.\nFree, madam? No. I made no such report.\nHe’s bound unto Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFor what good turn?\n\nMESSENGER.\nFor the best turn i’ th’ bed.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am pale, Charmian.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMadam, he’s married to Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThe most infectious pestilence upon thee!\n\n[Strikes him down.]\n\nMESSENGER.\nGood madam, patience.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat say you?\n\n[Strikes him again.]\n\nHence, horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes\nLike balls before me! I’ll unhair thy head!\n\n[She hales him up and down.]\n\nThou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine,\nSmarting in ling’ring pickle.\n\nMESSENGER.\nGracious madam,\nI that do bring the news made not the match.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSay ’tis not so, a province I will give thee,\nAnd make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst\nShall make thy peace for moving me to rage,\nAnd I will boot thee with what gift beside\nThy modesty can beg.\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe’s married, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nRogue, thou hast lived too long.\n\n[Draws a knife.]\n\nMESSENGER.\nNay then I’ll run.\nWhat mean you, madam? I have made no fault.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood madam, keep yourself within yourself.\nThe man is innocent.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSome innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt.\nMelt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures\nTurn all to serpents! Call the slave again.\nThough I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nHe is afeard to come.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI will not hurt him.\n\n[Exit Charmian.]\n\nThese hands do lack nobility that they strike\nA meaner than myself, since I myself\nHave given myself the cause.\n\nEnter the Messenger again with Charmian.\n\nCome hither, sir.\nThough it be honest, it is never good\nTo bring bad news. Give to a gracious message\nAn host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell\nThemselves when they be felt.\n\nMESSENGER.\nI have done my duty.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs he married?\nI cannot hate thee worser than I do\nIf thou again say “Yes.”\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe’s married, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThe gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still!\n\nMESSENGER.\nShould I lie, madam?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, I would thou didst,\nSo half my Egypt were submerged and made\nA cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence.\nHadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me\nThou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?\n\nMESSENGER.\nI crave your highness’ pardon.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe is married?\n\nMESSENGER.\nTake no offence that I would not offend you.\nTo punish me for what you make me do\nSeems much unequal. He’s married to Octavia.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, that his fault should make a knave of thee\nThat art not what thou’rt sure of! Get thee hence!\nThe merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome\nAre all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,\nAnd be undone by ’em!\n\n[Exit Messenger.]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nGood your highness, patience.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIn praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMany times, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI am paid for’t now.\nLead me from hence;\nI faint. O Iras, Charmian! ’Tis no matter.\nGo to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him\nReport the feature of Octavia, her years,\nHer inclination; let him not leave out\nThe colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.\n\n[Exit Alexas.]\n\nLet him for ever go—let him not, Charmian.\nThough he be painted one way like a Gorgon,\nThe other way ’s a Mars. [To Mardian] Bid you Alexas\nBring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,\nBut do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE VI. Near Misenum.\nFlourish. Enter Pompey and Menas at one door, with drum and trumpet; at another, Caesar, Lepidus, Antony, Enobarbus, Maecenas, Agrippa, with Soldiers marching.\n\nPOMPEY.\nYour hostages I have, so have you mine,\nAnd we shall talk before we fight.\n\nCAESAR.\nMost meet\nThat first we come to words, and therefore have we\nOur written purposes before us sent,\nWhich if thou hast considered, let us know\nIf ’twill tie up thy discontented sword\nAnd carry back to Sicily much tall youth\nThat else must perish here.\n\nPOMPEY.\nTo you all three,\nThe senators alone of this great world,\nChief factors for the gods: I do not know\nWherefore my father should revengers want,\nHaving a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,\nWho at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,\nThere saw you labouring for him. What was’t\nThat moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what\nMade the all-honoured, honest Roman, Brutus,\nWith the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,\nTo drench the Capitol, but that they would\nHave one man but a man? And that is it\nHath made me rig my navy, at whose burden\nThe angered ocean foams, with which I meant\nTo scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome\nCast on my noble father.\n\nCAESAR.\nTake your time.\n\nANTONY.\nThou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.\nWe’ll speak with thee at sea. At land thou know’st\nHow much we do o’ercount thee.\n\nPOMPEY.\nAt land indeed\nThou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house;\nBut since the cuckoo builds not for himself,\nRemain in’t as thou mayst.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nBe pleased to tell us—\nFor this is from the present—how you take\nThe offers we have sent you.\n\nCAESAR.\nThere’s the point.\n\nANTONY.\nWhich do not be entreated to, but weigh\nWhat it is worth embraced.\n\nCAESAR.\nAnd what may follow\nTo try a larger fortune.\n\nPOMPEY.\nYou have made me offer\nOf Sicily, Sardinia; and I must\nRid all the sea of pirates; then to send\nMeasures of wheat to Rome. This ’greed upon,\nTo part with unhacked edges and bear back\nOur targes undinted.\n\nCAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS.\nThat’s our offer.\n\nPOMPEY.\nKnow, then,\nI came before you here a man prepared\nTo take this offer. But Mark Antony\nPut me to some impatience. Though I lose\nThe praise of it by telling, you must know\nWhen Caesar and your brother were at blows,\nYour mother came to Sicily and did find\nHer welcome friendly.\n\nANTONY.\nI have heard it, Pompey,\nAnd am well studied for a liberal thanks\nWhich I do owe you.\n\nPOMPEY.\nLet me have your hand.\nI did not think, sir, to have met you here.\n\nANTONY.\nThe beds i’ th’ East are soft; and thanks to you,\nThat called me timelier than my purpose hither,\nFor I have gained by ’t.\n\nCAESAR.\nSince I saw you last,\nThere is a change upon you.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWell, I know not\nWhat counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,\nBut in my bosom shall she never come\nTo make my heart her vassal.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWell met here.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.\nI crave our composition may be written\nAnd sealed between us.\n\nCAESAR.\nThat’s the next to do.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWe’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s\nDraw lots who shall begin.\n\nANTONY.\nThat will I, Pompey.\n\nPOMPEY.\nNo, Antony, take the lot.\nBut, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery\nShall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar\nGrew fat with feasting there.\n\nANTONY.\nYou have heard much.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI have fair meanings, sir.\n\nANTONY.\nAnd fair words to them.\n\nPOMPEY.\nThen so much have I heard.\nAnd I have heard Apollodorus carried—\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNo more of that. He did so.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhat, I pray you?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nA certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI know thee now. How far’st thou, soldier?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWell;\nAnd well am like to do, for I perceive\nFour feasts are toward.\n\nPOMPEY.\nLet me shake thy hand.\nI never hated thee. I have seen thee fight\nWhen I have envied thy behaviour.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nSir,\nI never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye\nWhen you have well deserved ten times as much\nAs I have said you did.\n\nPOMPEY.\nEnjoy thy plainness;\nIt nothing ill becomes thee.\nAboard my galley I invite you all.\nWill you lead, lords?\n\nCAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS.\nShow’s the way, sir.\n\nPOMPEY.\nCome.\n\n[Exeunt all but Enobarbus and Menas.]\n\nMENAS.\n[Aside.] Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this treaty.—\nYou and I have known, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAt sea, I think.\n\nMENAS.\nWe have, sir.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYou have done well by water.\n\nMENAS.\nAnd you by land.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.\n\nMENAS.\nNor what I have done by water.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.\n\nMENAS.\nAnd you by land.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThere I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas. If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.\n\nMENAS.\nAll men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBut there is never a fair woman has a true face.\n\nMENAS.\nNo slander. They steal hearts.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nWe came hither to fight with you.\n\nMENAS.\nFor my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nIf he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again.\n\nMENAS.\nYou have said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nCaesar’s sister is called Octavia.\n\nMENAS.\nTrue, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nBut she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.\n\nMENAS.\nPray you, sir?\n\nENOBARBUS.\n’Tis true.\n\nMENAS.\nThen is Caesar and he for ever knit together.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nIf I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.\n\nMENAS.\nI think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.\n\nMENAS.\nWho would not have his wife so?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNot he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is. He married but his occasion here.\n\nMENAS.\nAnd thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nI shall take it, sir. We have used our throats in Egypt.\n\nMENAS.\nCome, let’s away.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already; the least wind i’ th’ world will blow them down.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nLepidus is high-coloured.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nThey have made him drink alms-drink.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nAs they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out “no more”, reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nBut it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWhy, this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nTo be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in ’t, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.\n\nA sennet sounded. Enter Caesar, Antony, Pompey, Lepidus, Agrippa, Maecenas, Enobarbus, Menas with other Captains.\n\nANTONY.\n[To Caesar.] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile\nBy certain scales i’ th’ pyramid; they know\nBy th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth\nOr foison follow. The higher Nilus swells,\nThe more it promises. As it ebbs, the seedsman\nUpon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,\nAnd shortly comes to harvest.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYou’ve strange serpents there?\n\nANTONY.\nAy, Lepidus.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nYour serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.\n\nANTONY.\nThey are so.\n\nPOMPEY.\nSit, and some wine! A health to Lepidus!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nI am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNot till you have slept. I fear me you’ll be in till then.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nNay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.\n\nMENAS.\n[Aside to Pompey.] Pompey, a word.\n\nPOMPEY.\n[Aside to Menas.] Say in mine ear what is ’t?\n\nMENAS.\n[Whispers in ’s ear.] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain,\nAnd hear me speak a word.\n\nPOMPEY.\n[Aside to Menas.] Forbear me till anon.—\nThis wine for Lepidus!\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWhat manner o’ thing is your crocodile?\n\nANTONY.\nIt is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth. It is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.\n\nLEPIDUS.\nWhat colour is it of?\n\nANTONY.\nOf its own colour too.\n\nLEPIDUS.\n’Tis a strange serpent.\n\nANTONY.\n’Tis so, and the tears of it are wet.\n\nCAESAR.\nWill this description satisfy him?\n\nANTONY.\nWith the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure.\n\nPOMPEY.\n[Aside to Menas.] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that? Away!\nDo as I bid you.—Where’s this cup I called for?\n\nMENAS.\n[Aside to Pompey.] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me,\nRise from thy stool.\n\nPOMPEY.\n[Aside to Menas.] I think thou’rt mad.\n\n[Rises and walks aside.]\n\nThe matter?\n\nMENAS.\nI have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.\n\nPOMPEY.\nThou hast served me with much faith. What’s else to say?—\nBe jolly, lords.\n\nANTONY.\nThese quicksands, Lepidus,\nKeep off them, for you sink.\n\nMENAS.\nWilt thou be lord of all the world?\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhat sayst thou?\n\nMENAS.\nWilt thou be lord of the whole world?\nThat’s twice.\n\nPOMPEY.\nHow should that be?\n\nMENAS.\nBut entertain it,\nAnd though you think me poor, I am the man\nWill give thee all the world.\n\nPOMPEY.\nHast thou drunk well?\n\nMENAS.\nNo, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.\nThou art, if thou dar’st be, the earthly Jove.\nWhate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips\nIs thine, if thou wilt have’t.\n\nPOMPEY.\nShow me which way.\n\nMENAS.\nThese three world-sharers, these competitors,\nAre in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable,\nAnd when we are put off, fall to their throats.\nAll then is thine.\n\nPOMPEY.\nAh, this thou shouldst have done\nAnd not have spoke on ’t! In me ’tis villainy;\nIn thee ’t had been good service. Thou must know\n’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;\nMine honour it. Repent that e’er thy tongue\nHath so betray’d thine act. Being done unknown,\nI should have found it afterwards well done,\nBut must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.\n\nMENAS.\n[Aside.] For this,\nI’ll never follow thy palled fortunes more.\nWho seeks, and will not take when once ’tis offered,\nShall never find it more.\n\nPOMPEY.\nThis health to Lepidus!\n\nANTONY.\nBear him ashore. I’ll pledge it for him, Pompey.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHere’s to thee, Menas!\n\nMENAS.\nEnobarbus, welcome!\n\nPOMPEY.\nFill till the cup be hid.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThere’s a strong fellow, Menas.\n\n[Pointing to the servant who carries off Lepidus.]\n\nMENAS.\nWhy?\n\nENOBARBUS.\n’A bears the third part of the world, man. Seest not?\n\nMENAS.\nThe third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,\nThat it might go on wheels!\n\nENOBARBUS.\nDrink thou. Increase the reels.\n\nMENAS.\nCome.\n\nPOMPEY.\nThis is not yet an Alexandrian feast.\n\nANTONY.\nIt ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!\nHere is to Caesar!\n\nCAESAR.\nI could well forbear’t.\nIt’s monstrous labour when I wash my brain\nAnd it grows fouler.\n\nANTONY.\nBe a child o’ the time.\n\nCAESAR.\nPossess it, I’ll make answer.\nBut I had rather fast from all, four days,\nThan drink so much in one.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[To Antony.] Ha, my brave emperor,\nShall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals\nAnd celebrate our drink?\n\nPOMPEY.\nLet’s ha’t, good soldier.\n\nANTONY.\nCome, let’s all take hands\nTill that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense\nIn soft and delicate Lethe.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAll take hands.\nMake battery to our ears with the loud music,\nThe while I’ll place you; then the boy shall sing.\nThe holding every man shall beat as loud\nAs his strong sides can volley.\n\nMusic plays. Enobarbus places them hand in hand.\n\n       THE SONG.\n  Come, thou monarch of the vine,\n  Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!\n  In thy vats our cares be drowned,\n  With thy grapes our hairs be crowned.\n  Cup us till the world go round,\n  Cup us till the world go round!\n\nCAESAR.\nWhat would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,\nLet me request you off. Our graver business\nFrowns at this levity.—Gentle lords, let’s part.\nYou see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb\nIs weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue\nSplits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost\nAnticked us all. What needs more words. Good night.\nGood Antony, your hand.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI’ll try you on the shore.\n\nANTONY.\nAnd shall, sir. Give’s your hand.\n\nPOMPEY.\nO Antony,\nYou have my father’s house.\nBut, what?

These drums, these trumpets, flutes! What!\nLet Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell\nTo these great fellows. Sound and be hanged, sound out!\n\n[Sound a flourish with drums.]\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHoo, says ’a! There’s my cap!\n\nMENAS.\nHoo! Noble captain, come.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Here’s the manner of ’t:\nI’ th’ market-place, on a tribunal silvered,\nCleopatra and himself in chairs of gold\nWere publicly enthroned. At the feet sat\nCaesarion, whom they call my father’s son,\nAnd all the unlawful issue that their lust\nSince then hath made between them. Unto her\nHe gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her\nOf lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,\nAbsolute queen.\n\nMAECENAS.\nThis in the public eye?\n\nCAESAR.\nI’ th’ common showplace where they exercise.\nHis sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings:\nGreat Media, Parthia, and Armenia\nHe gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned\nSyria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She\nIn th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis\nThat day appeared, and oft before gave audience,\nAs ’tis reported, so.\n\nMAECENAS.\nLet Rome be thus informed.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWho, queasy with his insolence already,\nWill their good thoughts call from him.\n\nCAESAR.\nThe people knows it and have now received\nHis accusations.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWho does he accuse?\n\nCAESAR.\nCaesar, and that, having in Sicily\nSextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him\nHis part o’ th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me\nSome shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets\nThat Lepidus of the triumvirate\nShould be deposed and, being, that we detain\nAll his revenue.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nSir, this should be answered.\n\nCAESAR.\n’Tis done already, and messenger gone.\nI have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,\nThat he his high authority abused,\nAnd did deserve his change. For what I have conquered\nI grant him part; but then in his Armenia\nAnd other of his conquered kingdoms, I\nDemand the like.\n\nMAECENAS.\nHe’ll never yield to that.\n\nCAESAR.\nNor must not then be yielded to in this.\n\nEnter Octavia with her train.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nHail, Caesar, and my lord!

Best of comfort,\nAnd ever welcome to us.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nWelcome, lady.\n\nMAECENAS.\nWelcome, dear madam.\nEach heart in Rome does love and pity you.\nOnly th’ adulterous Antony, most large\nIn his abominations, turns you off\nAnd gives his potent regiment to a trull\nThat noises it against us.\n\nOCTAVIA.\nIs it so, sir?\n\nCAESAR.\nMost certain.

I little thought\nYou would have followed.\n\nANTONY.\nEgypt, thou knew’st too well\nMy heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings,\nAnd thou shouldst tow me after. O’er my spirit\nThy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that\nThy beck might from the bidding of the gods\nCommand me.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, my pardon!\n\nANTONY.\nNow I must\nTo the young man send humble treaties, dodge\nAnd palter in the shifts of lowness, who\nWith half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased,\nMaking and marring fortunes. You did know\nHow much you were my conqueror, and that\nMy sword, made weak by my affection, would\nObey it on all cause.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPardon, pardon!\n\nANTONY.\nFall not a tear, I say; one of them rates\nAll that is won and lost. Give me a kiss.\nEven this repays me.\nWe sent our schoolmaster. Is he come back?\nLove, I am full of lead. Some wine\nWithin there, and our viands! Fortune knows\nWe scorn her most when most she offers blows.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE XIII. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.\nEnter Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian and Iras.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat shall we do, Enobarbus?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nThink, and die.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIs Antony or we in fault for this?\n\nENOBARBUS.\nAntony only, that would make his will\nLord of his reason. What though you fled\nFrom that great face of war, whose several ranges\nFrighted each other? Why should he follow?\nThe itch of his affection should not then\nHave nicked his captainship, at such a point,\nWhen half to half the world opposed, he being\nThe mered question. ’Twas a shame no less\nThan was his loss, to course your flying flags\nAnd leave his navy gazing.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPrithee, peace.\n\nEnter the Ambassador with Antony.\n\nANTONY.\nIs that his answer?\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nAy, my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nThe Queen shall then have courtesy, so she\nWill yield us up.\n\nAMBASSADOR.\nHe says so.\n\nANTONY.\nLet her know’t.—\nTo the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,\nAnd he will fill thy wishes to the brim\nWith principalities.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat head, my lord?\n\nANTONY.\nTo him again. Tell him he wears the rose\nOf youth upon him, from which the world should note\nSomething particular: his coin, ships, legions,\nMay be a coward’s; whose ministers would prevail\nUnder the service of a child as soon\nAs i’ th’ command of Caesar. I dare him therefore\nTo lay his gay comparisons apart,\nAnd answer me declined, sword against sword,\nOurselves alone. I’ll write it. Follow me.\n\n[Exeunt Antony and Ambassador.]\n\nENOBARBUS.\nYes, like enough high-battled Caesar will\nUnstate his happiness, and be staged to th’ show\nAgainst a sworder! I see men’s judgments are\nA parcel of their fortunes, and things outward\nDo draw the inward quality after them\nTo suffer all alike. That he should dream,\nKnowing all measures, the full Caesar will\nAnswer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued\nHis judgment too.\n\nEnter a Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nA messenger from Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat, no more ceremony? See, my women,\nAgainst the blown rose may they stop their nose\nThat kneeled unto the buds. Admit him, sir.\n\n[Exit Servant.]\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[Aside.] Mine honesty and I begin to square.\nThe loyalty well held to fools does make\nOur faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure\nTo follow with allegiance a fallen lord\nDoes conquer him that did his master conquer,\nAnd earns a place i’ th’ story.\n\nEnter Thidias.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCaesar’s will?\n\nTHIDIAS.\nHear it apart.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNone but friends. Say boldly.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nSo haply are they friends to Antony.\n\nENOBARBUS.\nHe needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,\nOr needs not us. If Caesar please, our master\nWill leap to be his friend. For us, you know\nWhose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nSo.—\nThus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats\nNot to consider in what case thou stand’st\nFurther than he is Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGo on; right royal.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nHe knows that you embrace not Antony\nAs you did love, but as you feared him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO!\n\nTHIDIAS.\nThe scars upon your honour, therefore, he\nDoes pity as constrained blemishes,\nNot as deserved.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe is a god and knows\nWhat is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,\nBut conquered merely.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[Aside.] To be sure of that,\nI will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky\nThat we must leave thee to thy sinking, for\nThy dearest quit thee.\n\n[Exit Enobarbus.]\n\nTHIDIAS.\nShall I say to Caesar\nWhat you require of him? For he partly begs\nTo be desired to give. It much would please him\nThat of his fortunes you should make a staff\nTo lean upon. But it would warm his spirits\nTo hear from me you had left Antony,\nAnd put yourself under his shroud,\nThe universal landlord.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat’s your name?\n\nTHIDIAS.\nMy name is Thidias.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMost kind messenger,\nSay to great Caesar this in deputation:\nI kiss his conqu’ring hand. Tell him I am prompt\nTo lay my crown at’s feet, and there to kneel.\nTell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear\nThe doom of Egypt.\n\nTHIDIAS.\n’Tis your noblest course.\nWisdom and fortune combating together,\nIf that the former dare but what it can,\nNo chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay\nMy duty on your hand.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nYour Caesar’s father oft,\nWhen he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,\nBestowed his lips on that unworthy place\nAs it rained kisses.\n\nEnter Antony and Enobarbus.\n\nANTONY.\nFavours, by Jove that thunders!\nWhat art thou, fellow?\n\nTHIDIAS.\nOne that but performs\nThe bidding of the fullest man and worthiest\nTo have command obeyed.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n[Aside.] You will be whipped.\n\nANTONY.\nApproach there.—Ah, you kite!—Now, gods and devils,\nAuthority melts from me. Of late when I cried “Ho!”\nLike boys unto a muss, kings would start forth\nAnd cry “Your will?” Have you no ears? I am\nAntony yet.\n\nEnter Servants.\n\nTake hence this jack and whip him.\n\nENOBARBUS.\n’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp\nThan with an old one dying.\n\nANTONY.\nMoon and stars!\nWhip him. Were’t twenty of the greatest tributaries\nThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them\nSo saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name\nSince she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,\nTill like a boy you see him cringe his face\nAnd whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.\n\nTHIDIAS.\nMark Antony—\n\nANTONY.\nTug him away. Being whipp’d,\nBring him again. This jack of Caesar’s shall\nBear us an errand to him.\n\n[Exeunt Servants with Thidias.]\n\nYou were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!\nHave I my pillow left unpressed in Rome,\nForborne the getting of a lawful race,\nAnd by a gem of women, to be abused\nBy one that looks on feeders?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGood my lord—\n\nANTONY.\nYou have been a boggler ever.\nBut when we in our viciousness grow hard—\nO misery on’t!—the wise gods seal our eyes,\nIn our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us\nAdore our errors, laugh at’s while we strut\nTo our confusion.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO, is’t come to this?\n\nANTONY.\nI found you as a morsel cold upon\nDead Caesar’s trencher; nay, you were a fragment\nOf Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours,\nUnregistered in vulgar fame, you have\nLuxuriously pick’d out. For I am sure,\nThough you can guess what temperance should be,\nYou know not what it is.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWherefore is this?\n\nANTONY.\nTo let a fellow that will take rewards\nAnd say “God quit you!” be familiar with\nMy playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal\nAnd plighter of high hearts! O that I were\nUpon the hill of Basan, to outroar\nThe horned herd! For I have savage cause,\nAnd to proclaim it civilly were like\nA haltered neck which does the hangman thank\nFor being yare about him.\n\nEnter a Servant with Thidias.\n\nIs he whipped?\n\nSERVANT.\nSoundly, my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nCried he? And begged he pardon?\n\nSERVANT.\nHe did ask favour.\n\nANTONY.\nIf that thy father live, let him repent\nThou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry\nTo follow Caesar in his triumph, since\nThou hast been whipped for following him. Henceforth\nThe white hand of a lady fever thee;\nShake thou to look on’t. Get thee back to Caesar;\nTell him thy entertainment. Look thou say\nHe makes me angry with him; for he seems\nProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,\nNot what he knew I was. He makes me angry,\nAnd at this time most easy ’tis to do’t,\nWhen my good stars that were my former guides\nHave empty left their orbs and shot their fires\nInto th’ abysm of hell. If he mislike\nMy speech and what is done, tell him he has\nHipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom\nHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,\nAs he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.\nHence with thy stripes, be gone.\n\n[Exit Thidias.]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHave you done yet?\n\nANTONY.\nAlack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed,\nAnd it portends alone the fall of Antony.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI must stay his time.\n\nANTONY.\nTo flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes\nWith one that ties his points?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNot know me yet?\n\nANTONY.\nCold-hearted toward me?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAh, dear, if I be so,\nFrom my cold heart let heaven engender hail\nAnd poison it in the source, and the first stone\nDrop in my neck; as it determines, so\nDissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite,\nTill, by degrees the memory of my womb,\nTogether with my brave Egyptians all,\nBy the discandying of this pelleted storm,\nLie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile\nHave buried them for prey!\n\nANTONY.\nI am satisfied.\nCaesar sits down in Alexandria, where\nI will oppose his fate. Our force by land\nHath nobly held; our severed navy too\nHave knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sea-like.\nWhere hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?\nIf from the field I shall return once more\nTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.\nI and my sword will earn our chronicle.\nThere’s hope in’t yet.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThat’s my brave lord!\n\nANTONY.\nI will be treble-sinewed, hearted, breathed,\nAnd fight maliciously. For when mine hours\nWere nice and lucky, men did ransom lives\nOf me for jests. But now I’ll set my teeth\nAnd send to darkness all that stop me. Come,\nLet’s have one other gaudy night. Call to me\nAll my sad captains. Fill our bowls once more\nLet’s mock the midnight bell.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nIt is my birthday.\nI had thought t’have held it poor, but since my lord\nIs Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.\n\nANTONY.\nWe will yet do well.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nCall all his noble captains to my lord.\n\nANTONY.\nDo so; we’ll speak to them; and tonight I’ll force\nThe wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,\nThere’s sap in’t yet. The next time I do fight\nI’ll make Death love me, for I will contend\nEven with his pestilent scythe.\n\n[Exeunt all but Enobarbus.]\n\nENOBARBUS.\nNow he’ll outstare the lightning. To be furious\nIs to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood\nThe dove will peck the estridge; and I see still\nA diminution in our captain’s brain\nRestores his heart. When valour preys on reason,\nIt eats the sword it fights with. I will seek\nSome way to leave him.\n\n[Exit.]",

Had my lips that power,\nThus would I wear them out.\n\nALL.\nA heavy sight!\n\nANTONY.\nI am dying, Egypt, dying.\nGive me some wine, and let me speak a little.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNo, let me speak, and let me rail so high\nThat the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,\nProvoked by my offence.\n\nANTONY.\nOne word, sweet queen:\nOf Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThey do not go together.\n\nANTONY.\nGentle, hear me.\nNone about Caesar trust but Proculeius.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy resolution and my hands I’ll trust;\nNone about Caesar.\n\nANTONY.\nThe miserable change now at my end\nLament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts\nIn feeding them with those my former fortunes\nWherein I lived the greatest prince o’ th’ world,\nThe noblest; and do now not basely die,\nNot cowardly put off my helmet to\nMy countryman; a Roman by a Roman\nValiantly vanquished. Now my spirit is going;\nI can no more.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNoblest of men, woo’t die?\nHast thou no care of me? Shall I abide\nIn this dull world, which in thy absence is\nNo better than a sty? O, see, my women,\n\n[ Antony dies.]\n\nThe crown o’ th’ earth doth melt.—My lord!\nO, withered is the garland of the war,\nThe soldier’s pole is fallen; young boys and girls\nAre level now with men. The odds is gone,\nAnd there is nothing left remarkable\nBeneath the visiting moon.\n\n[Faints.]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO, quietness, lady!\n\nIRAS.\nShe is dead too, our sovereign.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nLady!\n\nIRAS.\nMadam!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO madam, madam, madam!\n\nIRAS.\nRoyal Egypt, Empress!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nPeace, peace, Iras!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNo more but e’en a woman, and commanded\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks\nAnd does the meanest chares. It were for me\nTo throw my sceptre at the injurious gods,\nTo tell them that this world did equal theirs\nTill they had stolen our jewel. All’s but naught;\nPatience is sottish, and impatience does\nBecome a dog that’s mad. Then is it sin\nTo rush into the secret house of death\nEre death dare come to us? How do you, women?\nWhat, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian?\nMy noble girls! Ah, women, women! Look,\nOur lamp is spent, it’s out! Good sirs, take heart.\nWe’ll bury him; and then, what’s brave, what’s noble,\nLet’s do it after the high Roman fashion\nAnd make death proud to take us. Come, away.\nThis case of that huge spirit now is cold.\nAh, women, women! Come, we have no friend\nBut resolution and the briefest end.\n\n[Exeunt, bearing off Antony’s body.]",

Caesar’s Camp before Alexandria.\nEnter Caesar, Agrippa, Dolabella, Maecenas, Gallus, Proculeius with his council of war.\n\nCAESAR.\nGo to him, Dolabella, bid him yield.\nBeing so frustrate, tell him, he mocks\nThe pauses that he makes.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nCaesar, I shall.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Dercetus with the sword of Antony.\n\nCAESAR.\nWherefore is that? And what art thou that dar’st\nAppear thus to us?\n\nDERCETUS.\nI am called Dercetus.\nMark Antony I served, who best was worthy\nBest to be served. Whilst he stood up and spoke,\nHe was my master, and I wore my life\nTo spend upon his haters. If thou please\nTo take me to thee, as I was to him\nI’ll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,\nI yield thee up my life.\n\nCAESAR.\nWhat is’t thou say’st?\n\nDERCETUS.\nI say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.\n\nCAESAR.\nThe breaking of so great a thing should make\nA greater crack. The round world\nShould have shook lions into civil streets,\nAnd citizens to their dens. The death of Antony\nIs not a single doom; in the name lay\nA moiety of the world.\n\nDERCETUS.\nHe is dead, Caesar,\nNot by a public minister of justice,\nNor by a hired knife, but that self hand\nWhich writ his honour in the acts it did\nHath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,\nSplitted the heart. This is his sword.\nI robbed his wound of it. Behold it stained\nWith his most noble blood.\n\nCAESAR.\nLook you sad, friends?\nThe gods rebuke me, but it is tidings\nTo wash the eyes of kings.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nAnd strange it is\nThat nature must compel us to lament\nOur most persisted deeds.\n\nMAECENAS.\nHis taints and honours\nWaged equal with him.\n\nAGRIPPA.\nA rarer spirit never\nDid steer humanity, but you gods will give us\nSome faults to make us men. Caesar is touched.\n\nMAECENAS.\nWhen such a spacious mirror’s set before him,\nHe needs must see himself.\n\nCAESAR.\nO Antony,\nI have followed thee to this, but we do lance\nDiseases in our bodies. I must perforce\nHave shown to thee such a declining day\nOr look on thine. We could not stall together\nIn the whole world. But yet let me lament\nWith tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,\nThat thou, my brother, my competitor\nIn top of all design, my mate in empire,\nFriend and companion in the front of war,\nThe arm of mine own body, and the heart\nWhere mine his thoughts did kindle, that our stars,\nUnreconciliable, should divide\nOur equalness to this. Hear me, good friends—\n\nEnter an Egyptian.\n\nBut I will tell you at some meeter season.\nThe business of this man looks out of him;\nWe’ll hear him what he says. Whence are you?\n\nEGYPTIAN.\nA poor Egyptian yet. The queen, my mistress,\nConfined in all she has, her monument,\nOf thy intents desires instruction,\nThat she preparedly may frame herself\nTo the way she’s forced to.\n\nCAESAR.\nBid her have good heart.\nShe soon shall know of us, by some of ours,\nHow honourable and how kindly we\nDetermine for her. For Caesar cannot lean\nTo be ungentle.\n\nEGYPTIAN.\nSo the gods preserve thee!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCAESAR.\nCome hither, Proculeius. Go and say\nWe purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts\nThe quality of her passion shall require,\nLest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke\nShe do defeat us, for her life in Rome\nWould be eternal in our triumph. Go,\nAnd with your speediest bring us what she says\nAnd how you find of her.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nCaesar, I shall.\n\n[Exit Proculeius.]\n\nCAESAR.\nGallus, go you along.\n\n[Exit Gallus.]\n\nWhere’s Dolabella, to second Proculeius?\n\nALL.\nDolabella!\n\nCAESAR.\nLet him alone, for I remember now\nHow he’s employed. He shall in time be ready.\nGo with me to my tent, where you shall see\nHow hardly I was drawn into this war,\nHow calm and gentle I proceeded still\nIn all my writings. Go with me and see\nWhat I can show in this.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Alexandria. A Room in the Monument.\nEnter Cleopatra, Charmian and Iras.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy desolation does begin to make\nA better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar;\nNot being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave,\nA minister of her will. And it is great\nTo do that thing that ends all other deeds,\nWhich shackles accidents and bolts up change,\nWhich sleeps and never palates more the dung,\nThe beggar’s nurse and Caesar’s.\n\nEnter Proculeius.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nCaesar sends greetings to the queen of Egypt,\nAnd bids thee study on what fair demands\nThou mean’st to have him grant thee.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat’s thy name?\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nMy name is Proculeius.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAntony\nDid tell me of you, bade me trust you, but\nI do not greatly care to be deceived\nThat have no use for trusting. If your master\nWould have a queen his beggar, you must tell him\nThat majesty, to keep decorum, must\nNo less beg than a kingdom. If he please\nTo give me conquered Egypt for my son,\nHe gives me so much of mine own as I\nWill kneel to him with thanks.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nBe of good cheer.\nYou are fallen into a princely hand; fear nothing.\nMake your full reference freely to my lord,\nWho is so full of grace that it flows over\nOn all that need. Let me report to him\nYour sweet dependency, and you shall find\nA conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness\nWhere he for grace is kneeled to.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPray you tell him\nI am his fortune’s vassal and I send him\nThe greatness he has got. I hourly learn\nA doctrine of obedience, and would gladly\nLook him i’ th’ face.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nThis I’ll report, dear lady.\nHave comfort, for I know your plight is pitied\nOf him that caused it.\n\nEnter Gallus and Roman Soldiers.\n\nYou see how easily she may be surprised.\nGuard her till Caesar come.\n\nIRAS.\nRoyal queen!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO Cleopatra, thou art taken, queen!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nQuick, quick, good hands.\n\n[Drawing a dagger.]\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nHold, worthy lady, hold!\n\n[Seizes and disarms her.]\n\nDo not yourself such wrong, who are in this\nRelieved, but not betrayed.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat, of death too,\nThat rids our dogs of languish?\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nCleopatra,\nDo not abuse my master’s bounty by\nTh’ undoing of yourself. Let the world see\nHis nobleness well acted, which your death\nWill never let come forth.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhere art thou, Death?\nCome hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen\nWorth many babes and beggars!\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nO, temperance, lady!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSir, I will eat no meat; I’ll not drink, sir;\nIf idle talk will once be necessary,\nI’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I’ll ruin,\nDo Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I\nWill not wait pinioned at your master’s court,\nNor once be chastised with the sober eye\nOf dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up\nAnd show me to the shouting varletry\nOf censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt\nBe gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus’ mud\nLay me stark-naked, and let the water-flies\nBlow me into abhorring! Rather make\nMy country’s high pyramides my gibbet\nAnd hang me up in chains!\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nYou do extend\nThese thoughts of horror further than you shall\nFind cause in Caesar.\n\nEnter Dolabella.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nProculeius,\nWhat thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,\nAnd he hath sent for thee. For the queen,\nI’ll take her to my guard.\n\nPROCULEIUS.\nSo, Dolabella,\nIt shall content me best. Be gentle to her.\n[To Cleopatra.] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,\nIf you’ll employ me to him.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSay I would die.\n\n[Exeunt Proculeius and Soldiers.]\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMost noble empress, you have heard of me?\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI cannot tell.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nAssuredly you know me.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNo matter, sir, what I have heard or known.\nYou laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;\nIs’t not your trick?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nI understand not, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI dreamt there was an Emperor Antony.\nO, such another sleep, that I might see\nBut such another man!\n\nDOLABELLA.\nIf it might please you—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHis face was as the heavens, and therein stuck\nA sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted\nThe little O, the earth.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMost sovereign creature—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHis legs bestrid the ocean; his reared arm\nCrested the world; his voice was propertied\nAs all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;\nBut when he meant to quail and shake the orb,\nHe was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,\nThere was no winter in’t; an autumn ’twas\nThat grew the more by reaping. His delights\nWere dolphin-like; they showed his back above\nThe element they lived in. In his livery\nWalked crowns and crownets; realms and islands were\nAs plates dropped from his pocket.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nCleopatra—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThink you there was or might be such a man\nAs this I dreamt of?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nGentle madam, no.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nYou lie up to the hearing of the gods!\nBut if there be nor ever were one such,\nIt’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff\nTo vie strange forms with fancy; yet t’ imagine\nAn Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy,\nCondemning shadows quite.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nHear me, good madam.\nYour loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it\nAs answering to the weight. Would I might never\nO’ertake pursued success, but I do feel,\nBy the rebound of yours, a grief that smites\nMy very heart at root.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nI thank you, sir.\nKnow you what Caesar means to do with me?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nI am loath to tell you what I would you knew.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, pray you, sir.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nThough he be honourable—\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe’ll lead me, then, in triumph.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMadam, he will. I know it.\n\nFlourish. Enter Caesar, Proculeius, Gallus, Maecenas and others of his train.\n\nALL.\nMake way there! Caesar!\n\nCAESAR.\nWhich is the Queen of Egypt?\n\nDOLABELLA.\nIt is the Emperor, madam.\n\n[Cleopatra kneels.]\n\nCAESAR.\nArise, you shall not kneel.\nI pray you, rise. Rise, Egypt.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSir, the gods\nWill have it thus. My master and my lord\nI must obey.\n\nCAESAR.\nTake to you no hard thoughts.\nThe record of what injuries you did us,\nThough written in our flesh, we shall remember\nAs things but done by chance.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSole sir o’ th’ world,\nI cannot project mine own cause so well\nTo make it clear, but do confess I have\nBeen laden with like frailties which before\nHave often shamed our sex.\n\nCAESAR.\nCleopatra, know\nWe will extenuate rather than enforce.\nIf you apply yourself to our intents,\nWhich towards you are most gentle, you shall find\nA benefit in this change; but if you seek\nTo lay on me a cruelty by taking\nAntony’s course, you shall bereave yourself\nOf my good purposes, and put your children\nTo that destruction which I’ll guard them from\nIf thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAnd may, through all the world. ’Tis yours, and we,\nYour scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall\nHang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.\n\nCAESAR.\nYou shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThis is the brief of money, plate, and jewels\nI am possessed of. ’Tis exactly valued,\nNot petty things admitted. Where’s Seleucus?\n\nEnter Seleucus.\n\nSELEUCUS.\nHere, madam.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThis is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord,\nUpon his peril, that I have reserved\nTo myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.\n\nSELEUCUS.\nMadam, I had rather seal my lips\nThan to my peril speak that which is not.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhat have I kept back?\n\nSELEUCUS.\nEnough to purchase what you have made known.\n\nCAESAR.\nNay, blush not, Cleopatra. I approve\nYour wisdom in the deed.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nSee, Caesar! O, behold,\nHow pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours\nAnd should we shift estates, yours would be mine.\nThe ingratitude of this Seleucus does\nEven make me wild. O slave, of no more trust\nThan love that’s hired! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt\nGo back, I warrant thee! But I’ll catch thine eyes\nThough they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!\nO rarely base!\n\nCAESAR.\nGood queen, let us entreat you.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nO Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,\nThat thou vouchsafing here to visit me,\nDoing the honour of thy lordliness\nTo one so meek, that mine own servant should\nParcel the sum of my disgraces by\nAddition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,\nThat I some lady trifles have reserved,\nImmoment toys, things of such dignity\nAs we greet modern friends withal; and say\nSome nobler token I have kept apart\nFor Livia and Octavia, to induce\nTheir mediation, must I be unfolded\nWith one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me\nBeneath the fall I have.\n[To Seleucus.] Prithee go hence,\nOr I shall show the cinders of my spirits\nThrough th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,\nThou wouldst have mercy on me.\n\nCAESAR.\nForbear, Seleucus.\n\n[Exit Seleucus.]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nBe it known that we, the greatest, are misthought\nFor things that others do; and when we fall,\nWe answer others’ merits in our name,\nAre therefore to be pitied.\n\nCAESAR.\nCleopatra,\nNot what you have reserved nor what acknowledged\nPut we i’ th’ roll of conquest. Still be’t yours;\nBestow it at your pleasure, and believe\nCaesar’s no merchant to make prize with you\nOf things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheered;\nMake not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear queen;\nFor we intend so to dispose you as\nYourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.\nOur care and pity is so much upon you\nThat we remain your friend; and so, adieu.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nMy master and my lord!\n\nCAESAR.\nNot so. Adieu.\n\n[Flourish. Exeunt Caesar and his train.]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHe words me, girls, he words me, that I should not\nBe noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian!\n\n[Whispers to Charmian.]\n\nIRAS.\nFinish, good lady. The bright day is done,\nAnd we are for the dark.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nHie thee again.\nI have spoke already, and it is provided.\nGo put it to the haste.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nMadam, I will.\n\nEnter Dolabella.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nWhere’s the Queen?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nBehold, sir.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nDolabella!\n\nDOLABELLA.\nMadam, as thereto sworn by your command,\nWhich my love makes religion to obey,\nI tell you this: Caesar through Syria\nIntends his journey, and within three days\nYou with your children will he send before.\nMake your best use of this. I have performed\nYour pleasure and my promise.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nDolabella,\nI shall remain your debtor.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nI your servant.\nAdieu, good queen. I must attend on Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFarewell, and thanks.\n\n[Exit Dolabella.]\n\nNow, Iras, what think’st thou?\nThou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown\nIn Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves\nWith greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall\nUplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,\nRank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,\nAnd forced to drink their vapour.\n\nIRAS.\nThe gods forbid!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, ’tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors\nWill catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers\nBallad us out o’ tune. The quick comedians\nExtemporally will stage us and present\nOur Alexandrian revels; Antony\nShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see\nSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness\nI’ th’ posture of a whore.\n\nIRAS.\nO the good gods!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nNay, that’s certain.\n\nIRAS.\nI’ll never see’t, for I am sure mine nails\nAre stronger than mine eyes.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWhy, that’s the way\nTo fool their preparation and to conquer\nTheir most absurd intents.\n\nEnter Charmian.\n\nNow, Charmian!\nShow me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch\nMy best attires. I am again for Cydnus\nTo meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.\nNow, noble Charmian, we’ll dispatch indeed,\nAnd when thou hast done this chare, I’ll give thee leave\nTo play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.\n\n[Exit Iras. A noise within.]\n\nWherefore’s this noise?\n\nEnter a Guardsman.\n\nGUARDSMAN.\nHere is a rural fellow\nThat will not be denied your highness’ presence.\nHe brings you figs.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nLet him come in.\n\n[Exit Guardsman.]\n\nWhat poor an instrument\nMay do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.\nMy resolution’s placed, and I have nothing\nOf woman in me. Now from head to foot\nI am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moon\nNo planet is of mine.\n\nEnter Guardsman and Clown with a basket.\n\nGUARDSMAN.\nThis is the man.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAvoid, and leave him.\n\n[Exit Guardsman.]\n\nHast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there\nThat kills and pains not?\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal. Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nRemember’st thou any that have died on’t?\n\nCLOWN.\nVery many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday—a very honest woman, but something given to lie; as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty—how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm; but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGet thee hence. Farewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nI wish you all joy of the worm.\n\n[Sets down the basket.]\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nFarewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nYou must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAy, ay, farewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nLook you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nTake thou no care; it shall be heeded.\n\nCLOWN.\nVery good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWill it eat me?\n\nCLOWN.\nYou must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nWell, get thee gone. Farewell.\n\nCLOWN.\nYes, forsooth. I wish you joy o’ th’ worm.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Iras with a robe, crown, &c.\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nGive me my robe. Put on my crown. I have\nImmortal longings in me. Now no more\nThe juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.\nYare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear\nAntony call. I see him rouse himself\nTo praise my noble act. I hear him mock\nThe luck of Caesar, which the gods give men\nTo excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come!\nNow to that name my courage prove my title!\nI am fire and air; my other elements\nI give to baser life.—So, have you done?\nCome then, and take the last warmth of my lips.\nFarewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.\n\n[Kisses them. Iras falls and dies.]\n\nHave I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?\nIf thou and nature can so gently part,\nThe stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch,\nWhich hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still?\nIf thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world\nIt is not worth leave-taking.\n\nCHARMIAN.\nDissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say\nThe gods themselves do weep!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nThis proves me base.\nIf she first meet the curled Antony,\nHe’ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss\nWhich is my heaven to have.—Come, thou mortal wretch,\n\n[To an asp, which she applies to her breast.]\n\nWith thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\nOf life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,\nBe angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,\nThat I might hear thee call great Caesar ass\nUnpolicied!\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO eastern star!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nPeace, peace!\nDost thou not see my baby at my breast\nThat sucks the nurse asleep?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nO, break! O, break!\n\nCLEOPATRA.\nAs sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—\nO Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.\n\n[Applying another asp to her arm.]\n\nWhat should I stay—\n\n[Dies.]\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIn this vile world? So, fare thee well.\nNow boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies\nA lass unparalleled. Downy windows, close,\nAnd golden Phœbus never be beheld\nOf eyes again so royal! Your crown’s awry;\nI’ll mend it and then play.\n\nEnter the Guard rustling in.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nWhere’s the queen?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nSpeak softly. Wake her not.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nCaesar hath sent—\n\nCHARMIAN.\nToo slow a messenger.\n\n[Applies an asp.]\n\nO, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nApproach, ho! All’s not well. Caesar’s beguiled.\n\nSECOND GUARD.\nThere’s Dolabella sent from Caesar. Call him.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nWhat work is here, Charmian? Is this well done?\n\nCHARMIAN.\nIt is well done, and fitting for a princess\nDescended of so many royal kings.\nAh, soldier!\n\n[Charmian dies.]\n\nEnter Dolabella.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nHow goes it here?\n\nSECOND GUARD.\nAll dead.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nCaesar, thy thoughts\nTouch their effects in this. Thyself art coming\nTo see performed the dreaded act which thou\nSo sought’st to hinder.\n\nEnter Caesar and all his train, marching.\n\nALL.\nA way there, a way for Caesar!\n\nDOLABELLA.\nO sir, you are too sure an augurer:\nThat you did fear is done.\n\nCAESAR.\nBravest at the last,\nShe levelled at our purposes and, being royal,\nTook her own way. The manner of their deaths?\nI do not see them bleed.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nWho was last with them?\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nA simple countryman that brought her figs.\nThis was his basket.\n\nCAESAR.\nPoisoned then.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nO Caesar,\nThis Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.\nI found her trimming up the diadem\nOn her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,\nAnd on the sudden dropped.\n\nCAESAR.\nO noble weakness!\nIf they had swallowed poison ’twould appear\nBy external swelling; but she looks like sleep,\nAs she would catch another Antony\nIn her strong toil of grace.\n\nDOLABELLA.\nHere on her breast\nThere is a vent of blood, and something blown.\nThe like is on her arm.\n\nFIRST GUARD.\nThis is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves\nHave slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves\nUpon the caves of Nile.\n\nCAESAR.\nMost probable\nThat so she died, for her physician tells me\nShe hath pursued conclusions infinite\nOf easy ways to die. Take up her bed,\nAnd bear her women from the monument.\nShe shall be buried by her Antony.\nNo grave upon the earth shall clip in it\nA pair so famous. High events as these\nStrike those that make them; and their story is\nNo less in pity than his glory which\nBrought them to be lamented. Our army shall\nIn solemn show attend this funeral,\nAnd then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see\nHigh order in this great solemnity.\n\n[Exeunt omnes.]",
