If it pass against us,\nWe lose the better half of our possession:\nFor all the temporal lands which men devout\nBy testament have given to the church\nWould they strip from us; being valued thus:\nAs much as would maintain, to the king's honour,\nFull fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,\nSix thousand and two hundred good esquires;\nAnd, to relief of lazars and weak age,\nOf indigent faint souls past corporal toil.\nA hundred almshouses right well supplied;\nAnd to the coffers of the king beside,\nA thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.\nELY\nThis would drink deep.\nCANTERBURY\n'Twould drink the cup and all.\nELY\nBut what prevention?\nCANTERBURY\nThe king is full of grace and fair regard.\nELY\nAnd a true lover of the holy church.\nCANTERBURY\nThe courses of his youth promised it not.\nThe breath no sooner left his father's body,\nBut that his wildness, mortified in him,\nSeem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment\nConsideration, like an angel, came\nAnd whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,\nLeaving his body as a paradise,\nTo envelop and contain celestial spirits.\nNever was such a sudden scholar made;\nNever came reformation in a flood,\nWith such a heady currance, scouring faults\nNor never Hydra-headed wilfulness\nSo soon did lose his seat and all at once\nAs in this king.\nELY\nWe are blessed in the change.\nCANTERBURY\nHear him but reason in divinity,\nAnd all-admiring with an inward wish\nYou would desire the king were made a prelate:\nHear him debate of commonwealth affairs,\nYou would say it hath been all in all his study:\nList his discourse of war, and you shall hear\nA fearful battle render'd you in music:\nTurn him to any cause of policy,\nThe Gordian knot of it he will unloose,\nFamiliar as his garter: that, when he speaks,\nThe air, a charter'd libertine, is still,\nAnd the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,\nTo steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;\nSo that the art and practic part of life\nMust be the mistress to this theoric:\nWhich is a wonder how his grace should glean it,\nSince his addiction was to courses vain,\nHis companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,\nHis hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,\nAnd never noted in him any study,\nAny retirement, any sequestration\nFrom open haunts and popularity.\nELY\nThe strawberry grows underneath the nettle\nAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen best\nNeighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:\nAnd so the prince obscured his contemplation\nUnder the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,\nGrew like the summer grass, fastest by night,\nUnseen, yet crescive in his faculty.\nCANTERBURY\nIt must be so; for miracles are ceased;\nAnd therefore we must needs admit the means\nHow things are perfected.\nELY\nBut, my good lord,\nHow now for mitigation of this bill\nUrged by the commons?

    "content":"SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.\nEnter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants\nKING HENRY V\nWhere is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?\nEXETER\nNot here in presence.\nKING HENRY V\nSend for him, good uncle.\nWESTMORELAND\nShall we call in the ambassador, my liege?\nKING HENRY V\nNot yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,\nBefore we hear him, of some things of weight\nThat task our thoughts, concerning us and France.\nEnter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY\n\nCANTERBURY\nGod and his angels guard your sacred throne\nAnd make you long become it!\nKING HENRY V\nSure, we thank you.\nMy learned lord, we pray you to proceed\nAnd justly and religiously unfold\nWhy the law Salique that they have in France\nOr should, or should not, bar us in our claim:\nAnd God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,\nThat you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,\nOr nicely charge your understanding soul\nWith opening titles miscreate, whose right\nSuits not in native colours with the truth;\nFor God doth know how many now in health\nShall drop their blood in approbation\nOf what your reverence shall incite us to.\nTherefore take heed how you impawn our person,\nHow you awake our sleeping sword of war:\nWe charge you, in the name of God, take heed;\nFor never two such kingdoms did contend\nWithout much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops\nAre every one a woe, a sore complaint\n'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords\nThat make such waste in brief mortality.\nUnder this conjuration, speak, my lord;\nFor we will hear, note and believe in heart\nThat what you speak is in your conscience wash'd\nAs pure as sin with baptism.\nCANTERBURY\nThen hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,\nThat owe yourselves, your lives and services\nTo this imperial throne. There is no bar\nTo make against your highness' claim to France\nBut this, which they produce from Pharamond,\n'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'\n'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'\nWhich Salique land the French unjustly gloze\nTo be the realm of France, and Pharamond\nThe founder of this law and female bar.\nYet their own authors faithfully affirm\nThat the land Salique is in Germany,\nBetween the floods of Sala and of Elbe;\nWhere Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,\nThere left behind and settled certain French;\nWho, holding in disdain the German women\nFor some dishonest manners of their life,\nEstablish'd then this law; to wit, no female\nShould be inheritrix in Salique land:\nWhich Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,\nIs at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.\nThen doth it well appear that Salique law\nWas not devised for the realm of France:\nNor did the French possess the Salique land\nUntil four hundred one and twenty years\nAfter defunction of King Pharamond,\nIdly supposed the founder of this law;\nWho died within the year of our redemption\nFour hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great\nSubdued the Saxons, and did seat the French\nBeyond the river Sala, in the year\nEight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,\nKing Pepin, which deposed Childeric,\nDid, as heir general, being descended\nOf Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,\nMake claim and title to the crown of France.\nHugh Capet also, who usurped the crown\nOf Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male\nOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great,\nTo find his title with some shows of truth,\n'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,\nConvey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,\nDaughter to Charlemain, who was the son\nTo Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son\nOf Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,\nWho was sole heir to the usurper Capet,\nCould not keep quiet in his conscience,\nWearing the crown of France, till satisfied\nThat fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,\nWas lineal of the Lady Ermengare,\nDaughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:\nBy the which marriage the line of Charles the Great\nWas re-united to the crown of France.\nSo that, as clear as is the summer's sun.\nKing Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,\nKing Lewis his satisfaction, all appear\nTo hold in right and title of the female:\nSo do the kings of France unto this day;\nHowbeit they would hold up this Salique law\nTo bar your highness claiming from the female,\nAnd rather choose to hide them in a net\nThan amply to imbar their crooked titles\nUsurp'd from you and your progenitors.\nKING HENRY V\nMay I with right and conscience make this claim?\nCANTERBURY\nThe sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\nFor in the book of Numbers is it writ,\nWhen the man dies, let the inheritance\nDescend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,\nStand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;\nLook back into your mighty ancestors:\nGo, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,\nFrom whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,\nAnd your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,\nWho on the French ground play'd a tragedy,\nMaking defeat on the full power of France,\nWhiles his most mighty father on a hill\nStood smiling to behold his lion's whelp\nForage in blood of French nobility.\nO noble English. that could entertain\nWith half their forces the full Pride of France\nAnd let another half stand laughing by,\nAll out of work and cold for action!\nELY\nAwake remembrance of these valiant dead\nAnd with your puissant arm renew their feats:\nYou are their heir; you sit upon their throne;\nThe blood and courage that renowned them\nRuns in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege\nIs in the very May-morn of his youth,\nRipe for exploits and mighty enterprises.\nEXETER\nYour brother kings and monarchs of the earth\nDo all expect that you should rouse yourself,\nAs did the former lions of your blood.\nWESTMORELAND\nThey know your grace hath cause and means and might;\nSo hath your highness; never king of England\nHad nobles richer and more loyal subjects,\nWhose hearts have left their bodies here in England\nAnd lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.\nCANTERBURY\nO, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,\nWith blood and sword and fire to win your right;\nIn aid whereof we of the spiritualty\nWill raise your highness such a mighty sum\nAs never did the clergy at one time\nBring in to any of your ancestors.\nKING HENRY V\nWe must not only arm to invade the French,\nBut lay down our proportions to defend\nAgainst the Scot, who will make road upon us\nWith all advantages.\nCANTERBURY\nThey of those marches, gracious sovereign,\nShall be a wall sufficient to defend\nOur inland from the pilfering borderers.\nKING HENRY V\nWe do not mean the coursing snatchers only,\nBut fear the main intendment of the Scot,\nWho hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;\nFor you shall read that my great-grandfather\nNever went with his forces into France\nBut that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom\nCame pouring, like the tide into a breach,\nWith ample and brim fulness of his force,\nGalling the gleaned land with hot assays,\nGirding with grievous siege castles and towns;\nThat England, being empty of defence,\nHath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.\nCANTERBURY\nShe hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;\nFor hear her but exampled by herself:\nWhen all her chivalry hath been in France\nAnd she a mourning widow of her nobles,\nShe hath herself not only well defended\nBut taken and impounded as a stray\nThe King of Scots; whom she did send to France,\nTo fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings\nAnd make her chronicle as rich with praise\nAs is the ooze and bottom of the sea\nWith sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.\nWESTMORELAND\nBut there's a saying very old and true,\n'If that you will France win,\nThen with Scotland first begin:'\nFor once the eagle England being in prey,\nTo her unguarded nest the weasel Scot\nComes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,\nPlaying the mouse in absence of the cat,\nTo tear and havoc more than she can eat.\nEXETER\nIt follows then the cat must stay at home:\nYet that is but a crush'd necessity,\nSince we have locks to safeguard necessaries,\nAnd pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.\nWhile that the armed hand doth fight abroad,\nThe advised head defends itself at home;\nFor government, though high and low and lower,\nPut into parts, doth keep in one consent,\nCongreeing in a full and natural close,\nLike music.\nCANTERBURY\nTherefore doth heaven divide\nThe state of man in divers functions,\nSetting endeavour in continual motion;\nTo which is fixed, as an aim or butt,\nObedience: for so work the honey-bees,\nCreatures that by a rule in nature teach\nThe act of order to a peopled kingdom.\nThey have a king and officers of sorts;\nWhere some, like magistrates, correct at home,\nOthers, like merchants, venture trade abroad,\nOthers, like soldiers, armed in their stings,\nMake boot upon the summer's velvet buds,\nWhich pillage they with merry march bring home\nTo the tent-royal of their emperor;\nWho, busied in his majesty, surveys\nThe singing masons building roofs of gold,\nThe civil citizens kneading up the honey,\nThe poor mechanic porters crowding in\nTheir heavy burdens at his narrow gate,\nThe sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,\nDelivering o'er to executors pale\nThe lazy yawning drone. I this infer,\nThat many things, having full reference\nTo one consent, may work contrariously:\nAs many arrows, loosed several ways,\nCome to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;\nAs many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;\nAs many lines close in the dial's centre;\nSo may a thousand actions, once afoot.\nEnd in one purpose, and be all well borne\nWithout defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.\nDivide your happy England into four;\nWhereof take you one quarter into France,\nAnd you withal shall make all Gallia shake.\nIf we, with thrice such powers left at home,\nCannot defend our own doors from the dog,\nLet us be worried and our nation lose\nThe name of hardiness and policy.\nKING HENRY V\nCall in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.\nExeunt some Attendants\n\nNow are we well resolved; and, by God's help,\nAnd yours, the noble sinews of our power,\nFrance being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,\nOr break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,\nRuling in large and ample empery\nO'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,\nOr lay these bones in an unworthy urn,\nTombless, with no remembrance over them:\nEither our history shall with full mouth\nSpeak freely of our acts, or else our grave,\nLike Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,\nNot worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.\nEnter Ambassadors of France\n\nNow are we well prepared to know the pleasure\nOf our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear\nYour greeting is from him, not from the king.\nFirst Ambassador\nMay't please your majesty to give us leave\nFreely to render what we have in charge;\nOr shall we sparingly show you far off\nThe Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?\nKING HENRY V\nWe are no tyrant, but a Christian king;\nUnto whose grace our passion is as subject\nAs are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:\nTherefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness\nTell us the Dauphin's mind.\nFirst Ambassador\nThus, then, in few.\nYour highness, lately sending into France,\nDid claim some certain dukedoms, in the right\nOf your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.\nIn answer of which claim, the prince our master\nSays that you savour too much of your youth,\nAnd bids you be advised there's nought in France\nThat can be with a nimble galliard won;\nYou cannot revel into dukedoms there.\nHe therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,\nThis tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,\nDesires you let the dukedoms that you claim\nHear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.\nKING HENRY V\nWhat treasure, uncle?\nEXETER\nTennis-balls, my liege.\nKING HENRY V\nWe are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;\nHis present and your pains we thank you for:\nWhen we have march'd our rackets to these balls,\nWe will, in France, by God's grace, play a set\nShall strike his father's crown into the hazard.\nTell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler\nThat all the courts of France will be disturb'd\nWith chaces. And we understand him well,\nHow he comes o'er us with our wilder days,\nNot measuring what use we made of them.\nWe never valued this poor seat of England;\nAnd therefore, living hence, did give ourself\nTo barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common\nThat men are merriest when they are from home.\nBut tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,\nBe like a king and show my sail of greatness\nWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France:\nFor that I have laid by my majesty\nAnd plodded like a man for working-days,\nBut I will rise there with so full a glory\nThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,\nYea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.\nAnd tell the pleasant prince this mock of his\nHath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul\nShall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance\nThat shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows\nShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;\nMock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;\nAnd some are yet ungotten and unborn\nThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.\nBut this lies all within the will of God,\nTo whom I do appeal; and in whose name\nTell you the Dauphin I am coming on,\nTo venge me as I may and to put forth\nMy rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.\nSo get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin\nHis jest will savour but of shallow wit,\nWhen thousands weep more than did laugh at it.\nConvey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.\nExeunt Ambassadors\n\nEXETER\nThis was a merry message.\nKING HENRY V\nWe hope to make the sender blush at it.\nTherefore, my lords, omit no happy hour\nThat may give furtherance to our expedition;\nFor we have now no thought in us but France,\nSave those to God, that run before our business.\nTherefore let our proportions for these wars\nBe soon collected and all things thought upon\nThat may with reasonable swiftness add\nMore feathers to our wings; for, God before,\nWe'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.\nTherefore let every man now task his thought,\nThat this fair action may on foot be brought.\nExeunt.

Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants\n\nKING HENRY V\nNow sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.\nMy Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,\nAnd you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:\nThink you not that the powers we bear with us\nWill cut their passage through the force of France,\nDoing the execution and the act\nFor which we have in head assembled them?\nSCROOP\nNo doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.\nKING HENRY V\nI doubt not that; since we are well persuaded\nWe carry not a heart with us from hence\nThat grows not in a fair consent with ours,\nNor leave not one behind that doth not wish\nSuccess and conquest to attend on us.\nCAMBRIDGE\nNever was monarch better fear'd and loved\nThan is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject\nThat sits in heart-grief and uneasiness\nUnder the sweet shade of your government.\nGREY\nTrue: those that were your father's enemies\nHave steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you\nWith hearts create of duty and of zeal.\nKING HENRY V\nWe therefore have great cause of thankfulness;\nAnd shall forget the office of our hand,\nSooner than quittance of desert and merit\nAccording to the weight and worthiness.\nSCROOP\nSo service shall with steeled sinews toil,\nAnd labour shall refresh itself with hope,\nTo do your grace incessant services.\nKING HENRY V\nWe judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,\nEnlarge the man committed yesterday,\nThat rail'd against our person: we consider\nit was excess of wine that set him on;\nAnd on his more advice we pardon him.\nSCROOP\nThat's mercy, but too much security:\nLet him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example\nBreed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.\nKING HENRY V\nO, let us yet be merciful.\nCAMBRIDGE\nSo may your highness, and yet punish too.\nGREY\nSir,\nYou show great mercy, if you give him life,\nAfter the taste of much correction.\nKING HENRY V\nAlas, your too much love and care of me\nAre heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!\nIf little faults, proceeding on distemper,\nShall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye\nWhen capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,\nAppear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,\nThough Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care\nAnd tender preservation of our person,\nWould have him punished. And now to our French causes:\nWho are the late commissioners?\nCAMBRIDGE\nI one, my lord:\nYour highness bade me ask for it to-day.\nSCROOP\nSo did you me, my liege.\nGREY\nAnd I, my royal sovereign.\nKING HENRY V\nThen, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;\nThere yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,\nGrey of Northumberland, this same is yours:\nRead them; and know, I know your worthiness.\nMy Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,\nWe will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!\nWhat see you in those papers that you lose\nSo much complexion? Look ye, how they change!\nTheir cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there\nThat hath so cowarded and chased your blood\nOut of appearance?\nCAMBRIDGE\nI do confess my fault;\nAnd do submit me to your highness' mercy.\nGREY SCROOP\nTo which we all appeal.\nKING HENRY V\nThe mercy that was quick in us but late,\nBy your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:\nYou must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;\nFor your own reasons turn into your bosoms,\nAs dogs upon their masters, worrying you.\nSee you, my princes, and my noble peers,\nThese English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,\nYou know how apt our love was to accord\nTo furnish him with all appertinents\nBelonging to his honour; and this man\nHath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,\nAnd sworn unto the practises of France,\nTo kill us here in Hampton: to the which\nThis knight, no less for bounty bound to us\nThan Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,\nWhat shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,\nIngrateful, savage and inhuman creature!\nThou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,\nThat knew'st the very bottom of my soul,\nThat almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,\nWouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,\nMay it be possible, that foreign hire\nCould out of thee extract one spark of evil\nThat might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,\nThat, though the truth of it stands off as gross\nAs black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.\nTreason and murder ever kept together,\nAs two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,\nWorking so grossly in a natural cause,\nThat admiration did not whoop at them:\nBut thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in\nWonder to wait on treason and on murder:\nAnd whatsoever cunning fiend it was\nThat wrought upon thee so preposterously\nHath got the voice in hell for excellence:\nAll other devils that suggest by treasons\nDo botch and bungle up damnation\nWith patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd\nFrom glistering semblances of piety;\nBut he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,\nGave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,\nUnless to dub thee with the name of traitor.\nIf that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus\nShould with his lion gait walk the whole world,\nHe might return to vasty Tartar back,\nAnd tell the legions 'I can never win\nA soul so easy as that Englishman's.'\nO, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected\nThe sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?\nWhy, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?\nWhy, so didst thou: come they of noble family?\nWhy, so didst thou: seem they religious?\nWhy, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,\nFree from gross passion or of mirth or anger,\nConstant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,\nGarnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,\nNot working with the eye without the ear,\nAnd but in purged judgment trusting neither?\nSuch and so finely bolted didst thou seem:\nAnd thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,\nTo mark the full-fraught man and best indued\nWith some suspicion. I will weep for thee;\nFor this revolt of thine, methinks, is like\nAnother fall of man. Their faults are open:\nArrest them to the answer of the law;\nAnd God acquit them of their practises!\nEXETER\nI arrest thee of high treason, by the name of\nRichard Earl of Cambridge.\nI arrest thee of high treason, by the name of\nHenry Lord Scroop of Masham.\nI arrest thee of high treason, by the name of\nThomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.\nSCROOP\nOur purposes God justly hath discover'd;\nAnd I repent my fault more than my death;\nWhich I beseech your highness to forgive,\nAlthough my body pay the price of it.\nCAMBRIDGE\nFor me, the gold of France did not seduce;\nAlthough I did admit it as a motive\nThe sooner to effect what I intended:\nBut God be thanked for prevention;\nWhich I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,\nBeseeching God and you to pardon me.\nGREY\nNever did faithful subject more rejoice\nAt the discovery of most dangerous treason\nThan I do at this hour joy o'er myself.\nPrevented from a damned enterprise:\nMy fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.\nKING HENRY V\nGod quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.\nYou have conspired against our royal person,\nJoin'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers\nReceived the golden earnest of our death;\nWherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,\nHis princes and his peers to servitude,\nHis subjects to oppression and contempt\nAnd his whole kingdom into desolation.\nTouching our person seek we no revenge;\nBut we our kingdom's safety must so tender,\nWhose ruin you have sought, that to her laws\nWe do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,\nPoor miserable wretches, to your death:\nThe taste whereof, God of his mercy give\nYou patience to endure, and true repentance\nOf all your dear offences! Bear them hence.\nExeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded\n\nNow, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof\nShall be to you, as us, like glorious.\nWe doubt not of a fair and lucky war,\nSince God so graciously hath brought to light\nThis dangerous treason lurking in our way\nTo hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now\nBut every rub is smoothed on our way.\nThen forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver\nOur puissance into the hand of God,\nPutting it straight in expedition.\nCheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:\nNo king of England, if not king of France.\nExeunt",

They will steal\nany thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a\nlute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for\nthree half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn\nbrothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a\nfire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the\nmen would carry coals.

The\ntown is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the\nbreach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:\n'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to\nstand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is\nthroats to be cut, and works to be done; and there\nish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!\nJAMY\nBy the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves\nto slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'\nthe grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay\n't as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,\nthat is the breff and the long.

Fortune is\npainted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to\nsignify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is\npainted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which\nis the moral of it, that she is turning, and\ninconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her\nfoot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,\nwhich rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,\nthe poet makes a most excellent description of it:\nFortune is an excellent moral.\nPISTOL\nFortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;\nFor he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:\nA damned death!\nLet gallows gape for dog; let man go free\nAnd let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:\nBut Exeter hath given the doom of death\nFor pax of little price.\nTherefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:\nAnd let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut\nWith edge of penny cord and vile reproach:\nSpeak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.\nFLUELLEN\nAunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.\nPISTOL\nWhy then, rejoice therefore.\nFLUELLEN\nCertainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice\nat: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would\ndesire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put\nhim to execution; for discipline ought to be used.\nPISTOL\nDie and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!\nFLUELLEN\nIt is well.\nPISTOL\nThe fig of Spain!\nExit\n\nFLUELLEN\nVery good.\nGOWER\nWhy, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I\nremember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.\nFLUELLEN\nI'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the\nbridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it\nis very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,\nI warrant you, when time is serve.\nGOWER\nWhy, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then\ngoes to the wars, to grace himself at his return\ninto London under the form of a soldier. And such\nfellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:\nand they will learn you by rote where services were\ndone; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,\nat such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was\nshot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;\nand this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,\nwhich they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what\na beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of\nthe camp will do among foaming bottles and\nale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But\nyou must learn to know such slanders of the age, or\nelse you may be marvellously mistook.\nFLUELLEN\nI tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is\nnot the man that he would gladly make show to the\nworld he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will\ntell him my mind.\nDrum heard\n\nHark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with\nhim from the pridge.\nDrum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers\n\nGod pless your majesty!\nKING HENRY V\nHow now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?\nFLUELLEN\nAy, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has\nvery gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is\ngone off, look you; and there is gallant and most\nprave passages; marry, th' athversary was have\npossession of the pridge; but he is enforced to\nretire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the\npridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a\nprave man.\nKING HENRY V\nWhat men have you lost, Fluellen?\nFLUELLEN\nThe perdition of th' athversary hath been very\ngreat, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I\nthink the duke hath lost never a man, but one that\nis like to be executed for robbing a church, one\nBardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is\nall bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'\nfire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like\na coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;\nbut his nose is executed and his fire's out.\nKING HENRY V\nWe would have all such offenders so cut off: and we\ngive express charge, that in our marches through the\ncountry, there be nothing compelled from the\nvillages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the\nFrench upbraided or abused in disdainful language;\nfor when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the\ngentler gamester is the soonest winner.\nTucket. Enter MONTJOY\n\nMONTJOY\nYou know me by my habit.\nKING HENRY V\nWell then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?\nMONTJOY\nMy master's mind.\nKING HENRY V\nUnfold it.\nMONTJOY\nThus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:\nThough we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage\nis a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we\ncould have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we\nthought not good to bruise an injury till it were\nfull ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice\nis imperial: England shall repent his folly, see\nhis weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him\ntherefore consider of his ransom; which must\nproportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we\nhave lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in\nweight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.\nFor our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the\neffusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too\nfaint a number; and for our disgrace, his own\nperson, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and\nworthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and\ntell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his\nfollowers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far\nmy king and master; so much my office.\nKING HENRY V\nWhat is thy name? I know thy quality.\nMONTJOY\nMontjoy.\nKING HENRY V\nThou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.\nAnd tell thy king I do not seek him now;\nBut could be willing to march on to Calais\nWithout impeachment: for, to say the sooth,\nThough 'tis no wisdom to confess so much\nUnto an enemy of craft and vantage,\nMy people are with sickness much enfeebled,\nMy numbers lessened, and those few I have\nAlmost no better than so many French;\nWho when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,\nI thought upon one pair of English legs\nDid march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,\nThat I do brag thus! This your air of France\nHath blown that vice in me: I must repent.\nGo therefore, tell thy master here I am;\nMy ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,\nMy army but a weak and sickly guard;\nYet, God before, tell him we will come on,\nThough France himself and such another neighbour\nStand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.\nGo bid thy master well advise himself:\nIf we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,\nWe shall your tawny ground with your red blood\nDiscolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.\nThe sum of all our answer is but this:\nWe would not seek a battle, as we are;\nNor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:\nSo tell your master.\nMONTJOY\nI shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.\nExit\n\nGLOUCESTER\nI hope they will not come upon us now.\nKING HENRY V\nWe are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.\nMarch to the bridge; it now draws toward night:\nBeyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,\nAnd on to-morrow, bid them march away.\nExeunt",

Would it were\nday! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for\nthe dawning as we do.\nORLEANS\nWhat a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of\nEngland, to mope with his fat-brained followers so\nfar out of his knowledge!\nConstable\nIf the English had any apprehension, they would run away.\nORLEANS\nThat they lack; for if their heads had any\nintellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy\nhead-pieces.\nRAMBURES\nThat island of England breeds very valiant\ncreatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.\nORLEANS\nFoolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a\nRussian bear and have their heads crushed like\nrotten apples! You may as well say, that's a\nvaliant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.\nConstable\nJust, just; and the men do sympathize with the\nmastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving\ntheir wits with their wives: and then give them\ngreat meals of beef and iron and steel, they will\neat like wolves and fight like devils.\nORLEANS\nAy, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.\nConstable\nThen shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs\nto eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:\ncome, shall we about it?\nORLEANS\nIt is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten\nWe shall have each a hundred Englishmen.\nExeunt",

It is\nthe greatest admiration of the universal world, when\nthe true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the\nwars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to\nexamine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall\nfind, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle\nnor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,\nyou shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the\ncares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety\nof it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.\nGOWER\nWhy, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.\nFLUELLEN\nIf the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating\ncoxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,\nlook you, be an ass and a fool and a prating\ncoxcomb? in your own conscience, now?\nGOWER\nI will speak lower.\nFLUELLEN\nI pray you and beseech you that you will.\nExeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN\n\nKING HENRY V\nThough it appear a little out of fashion,\nThere is much care and valour in this Welshman.\nEnter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and MICHAEL WILLIAMS\n\nCOURT\nBrother John Bates, is not that the morning which\nbreaks yonder?\nBATES\nI think it be: but we have no great cause to desire\nthe approach of day.\nWILLIAMS\nWe see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think\nwe shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?\nKING HENRY V\nA friend.\nWILLIAMS\nUnder what captain serve you?\nKING HENRY V\nUnder Sir Thomas Erpingham.\nWILLIAMS\nA good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I\npray you, what thinks he of our estate?\nKING HENRY V\nEven as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be\nwashed off the next tide.\nBATES\nHe hath not told his thought to the king?\nKING HENRY V\nNo; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I\nspeak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I\nam: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the\nelement shows to him as it doth to me; all his\nsenses have but human conditions: his ceremonies\nlaid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and\nthough his affections are higher mounted than ours,\nyet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like\nwing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we\ndo, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish\nas ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess\nhim with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing\nit, should dishearten his army.\nBATES\nHe may show what outward courage he will; but I\nbelieve, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish\nhimself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he\nwere, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.\nKING HENRY V\nBy my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:\nI think he would not wish himself any where but\nwhere he is.\nBATES\nThen I would he were here alone; so should he be\nsure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.\nKING HENRY V\nI dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here\nalone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's\nminds: methinks I could not die any where so\ncontented as in the king's company; his cause being\njust and his quarrel honourable.\nWILLIAMS\nThat's more than we know.\nBATES\nAy, or more than we should seek after; for we know\nenough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if\nhis cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes\nthe crime of it out of us.\nWILLIAMS\nBut if the cause be not good, the king himself hath\na heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and\narms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join\ntogether at the latter day and cry all 'We died at\nsuch a place;' some swearing, some crying for a\nsurgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind\nthem, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their\nchildren rawly left. I am afeard there are few die\nwell that die in a battle; for how can they\ncharitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their\nargument? Now, if these men do not die well, it\nwill be a black matter for the king that led them to\nit; whom to disobey were against all proportion of\nsubjection.\nKING HENRY V\nSo, if a son that is by his father sent about\nmerchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the\nimputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be\nimposed upon his father that sent him: or if a\nservant, under his master's command transporting a\nsum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in\nmany irreconciled iniquities, you may call the\nbusiness of the master the author of the servant's\ndamnation: but this is not so: the king is not\nbound to answer the particular endings of his\nsoldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of\nhis servant; for they purpose not their death, when\nthey purpose their services. Besides, there is no\nking, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to\nthe arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all\nunspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them\nthe guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;\nsome, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of\nperjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that\nhave before gored the gentle bosom of peace with\npillage and robbery. Now, if these men have\ndefeated the law and outrun native punishment,\nthough they can outstrip men, they have no wings to\nfly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;\nso that here men are punished for before-breach of\nthe king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where\nthey feared the death, they have borne life away;\nand where they would be safe, they perish: then if\nthey die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of\ntheir damnation than he was before guilty of those\nimpieties for the which they are now visited. Every\nsubject's duty is the king's; but every subject's\nsoul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in\nthe wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every\nmote out of his conscience: and dying so, death\nis to him advantage; or not dying, the time was\nblessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:\nand in him that escapes, it were not sin to think\nthat, making God so free an offer, He let him\noutlive that day to see His greatness and to teach\nothers how they should prepare.\nWILLIAMS\n'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon\nhis own head, the king is not to answer it.\nBATES\nBut I do not desire he should answer for me; and\nyet I determine to fight lustily for him.\nKING HENRY V\nI myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.\nWILLIAMS\nAy, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but\nwhen our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we\nne'er the wiser.\nKING HENRY V\nIf I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.\nWILLIAMS\nYou pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an\nelder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can\ndo against a monarch! you may as well go about to\nturn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a\npeacock's feather. You'll never trust his word\nafter! come, 'tis a foolish saying.\nKING HENRY V\nYour reproof is something too round: I should be\nangry with you, if the time were convenient.\nWILLIAMS\nLet it be a quarrel between us, if you live.\nKING HENRY V\nI embrace it.\nWILLIAMS\nHow shall I know thee again?\nKING HENRY V\nGive me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my\nbonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I\nwill make it my quarrel.\nWILLIAMS\nHere's my glove: give me another of thine.\nKING HENRY V\nThere.\nWILLIAMS\nThis will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come\nto me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'\nby this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.\nKING HENRY V\nIf ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.\nWILLIAMS\nThou darest as well be hanged.\nKING HENRY V\nWell. I will do it, though I take thee in the\nking's company.\nWILLIAMS\nKeep thy word: fare thee well.\nBATES\nBe friends, you English fools, be friends: we have\nFrench quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.\nKING HENRY V\nIndeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to\none, they will beat us; for they bear them on their\nshoulders: but it is no English treason to cut\nFrench crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will\nbe a clipper.\nExeunt soldiers\n\nUpon the king! let us our lives, our souls,\nOur debts, our careful wives,\nOur children and our sins lay on the king!\nWe must bear all. O hard condition,\nTwin-born with greatness, subject to the breath\nOf every fool, whose sense no more can feel\nBut his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease\nMust kings neglect, that private men enjoy!\nAnd what have kings, that privates have not too,\nSave ceremony, save general ceremony?\nAnd what art thou, thou idle ceremony?\nWhat kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more\nOf mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?\nWhat are thy rents? what are thy comings in?\nO ceremony, show me but thy worth!\nWhat is thy soul of adoration?\nArt thou aught else but place, degree and form,\nCreating awe and fear in other men?\nWherein thou art less happy being fear'd\nThan they in fearing.\nWhat drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,\nBut poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,\nAnd bid thy ceremony give thee cure!\nThink'st thou the fiery fever will go out\nWith titles blown from adulation?\nWill it give place to flexure and low bending?\nCanst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,\nCommand the health of it? No, thou proud dream,\nThat play'st so subtly with a king's repose;\nI am a king that find thee, and I know\n'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,\nThe sword, the mace, the crown imperial,\nThe intertissued robe of gold and pearl,\nThe farced title running 'fore the king,\nThe throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp\nThat beats upon the high shore of this world,\nNo, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,\nNot all these, laid in bed majestical,\nCan sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,\nWho with a body fill'd and vacant mind\nGets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;\nNever sees horrid night, the child of hell,\nBut, like a lackey, from the rise to set\nSweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night\nSleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,\nDoth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,\nAnd follows so the ever-running year,\nWith profitable labour, to his grave:\nAnd, but for ceremony, such a wretch,\nWinding up days with toil and nights with sleep,\nHad the fore-hand and vantage of a king.\nThe slave, a member of the country's peace,\nEnjoys it; but in gross brain little wots\nWhat watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,\nWhose hours the peasant best advantages.\nEnter ERPINGHAM\n\nERPINGHAM\nMy lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,\nSeek through your camp to find you.\nKING HENRY V\nGood old knight,\nCollect them all together at my tent:\nI'll be before thee.\nERPINGHAM\nI shall do't, my lord.\nExit\n\nKING HENRY V\nO God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;\nPossess them not with fear; take from them now\nThe sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers\nPluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,\nO, not to-day, think not upon the fault\nMy father made in compassing the crown!\nI Richard's body have interred anew;\nAnd on it have bestow'd more contrite tears\nThan from it issued forced drops of blood:\nFive hundred poor I have in yearly pay,\nWho twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up\nToward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built\nTwo chantries, where the sad and solemn priests\nSing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;\nThough all that I can do is nothing worth,\nSince that my penitence comes after all,\nImploring pardon.\nEnter GLOUCESTER\n\nGLOUCESTER\nMy liege!\nKING HENRY V\nMy brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;\nI know thy errand, I will go with thee:\nThe day, my friends and all things stay for me.\nExeunt",

That I have labour'd,\nWith all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,\nTo bring your most imperial majesties\nUnto this bar and royal interview,\nYour mightiness on both parts best can witness.\nSince then my office hath so far prevail'd\nThat, face to face and royal eye to eye,\nYou have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,\nIf I demand, before this royal view,\nWhat rub or what impediment there is,\nWhy that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,\nDear nurse of arts and joyful births,\nShould not in this best garden of the world\nOur fertile France, put up her lovely visage?\nAlas, she hath from France too long been chased,\nAnd all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,\nCorrupting in its own fertility.\nHer vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,\nUnpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,\nLike prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,\nPut forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas\nThe darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory\nDoth root upon, while that the coulter rusts\nThat should deracinate such savagery;\nThe even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth\nThe freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,\nWanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,\nConceives by idleness and nothing teems\nBut hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,\nLosing both beauty and utility.\nAnd as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,\nDefective in their natures, grow to wildness,\nEven so our houses and ourselves and children\nHave lost, or do not learn for want of time,\nThe sciences that should become our country;\nBut grow like savages,--as soldiers will\nThat nothing do but meditate on blood,--\nTo swearing and stern looks, diffused attire\nAnd every thing that seems unnatural.\nWhich to reduce into our former favour\nYou are assembled: and my speech entreats\nThat I may know the let, why gentle Peace\nShould not expel these inconveniences\nAnd bless us with her former qualities.\nKING HENRY V\nIf, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,\nWhose want gives growth to the imperfections\nWhich you have cited, you must buy that peace\nWith full accord to all our just demands;\nWhose tenors and particular effects\nYou have enscheduled briefly in your hands.\nBURGUNDY\nThe king hath heard them; to the which as yet\nThere is no answer made.\nKING HENRY V\nWell then the peace,\nWhich you before so urged, lies in his answer.\nKING OF FRANCE\nI have but with a cursorary eye\nO'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace\nTo appoint some of your council presently\nTo sit with us once more, with better heed\nTo re-survey them, we will suddenly\nPass our accept and peremptory answer.\nKING HENRY V\nBrother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,\nAnd brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,\nWarwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;\nAnd take with you free power to ratify,\nAugment, or alter, as your wisdoms best\nShall see advantageable for our dignity,\nAny thing in or out of our demands,\nAnd we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,\nGo with the princes, or stay here with us?\nQUEEN ISABEL\nOur gracious brother, I will go with them:\nHaply a woman's voice may do some good,\nWhen articles too nicely urged be stood on.\nKING HENRY V\nYet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:\nShe is our capital demand, comprised\nWithin the fore-rank of our articles.\nQUEEN ISABEL\nShe hath good leave.\nExeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE\n\nKING HENRY V\nFair Katharine, and most fair,\nWill you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms\nSuch as will enter at a lady's ear\nAnd plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?\nKATHARINE\nYour majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.\nKING HENRY V\nO fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with\nyour French heart, I will be glad to hear you\nconfess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do\nyou like me, Kate?\nKATHARINE\nPardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'\nKING HENRY V\nAn angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.\nKATHARINE\nQue dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?\nALICE\nOui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.\nKING HENRY V\nI said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to\naffirm it.\nKATHARINE\nO bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de\ntromperies.\nKING HENRY V\nWhat says she, fair one? that the tongues of men\nare full of deceits?\nALICE\nOui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of\ndeceits: dat is de princess.\nKING HENRY V\nThe princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,\nKate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am\nglad thou canst speak no better English; for, if\nthou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king\nthat thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my\ncrown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but\ndirectly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me\nfarther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out\nmy suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so\nclap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?\nKATHARINE\nSauf votre honneur, me understand vell.\nKING HENRY V\nMarry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for\nyour sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I\nhave neither words nor measure, and for the other, I\nhave no strength in measure, yet a reasonable\nmeasure in strength. If I could win a lady at\nleap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my\narmour on my back, under the correction of bragging\nbe it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.\nOr if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse\nfor her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and\nsit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,\nKate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my\neloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;\nonly downright oaths, which I never use till urged,\nnor never break for urging. If thou canst love a\nfellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth\nsun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love\nof any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy\ncook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst\nlove me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee\nthat I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the\nLord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou\nlivest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and\nuncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee\nright, because he hath not the gift to woo in other\nplaces: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that\ncan rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do\nalways reason themselves out again. What! a\nspeaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A\ngood leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a\nblack beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow\nbald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax\nhollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the\nmoon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it\nshines bright and never changes, but keeps his\ncourse truly. If thou would have such a one, take\nme; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,\ntake a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?\nspeak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.\nKATHARINE\nIs it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?\nKING HENRY V\nNo; it is not possible you should love the enemy of\nFrance, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love\nthe friend of France; for I love France so well that\nI will not part with a village of it; I will have it\nall mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am\nyours, then yours is France and you are mine.\nKATHARINE\nI cannot tell vat is dat.\nKING HENRY V\nNo, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am\nsure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married\nwife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook\noff. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand\nvous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what\nthen? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est\nFrance et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,\nKate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much\nmore French: I shall never move thee in French,\nunless it be to laugh at me.\nKATHARINE\nSauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il\nest meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.\nKING HENRY V\nNo, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my\ntongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs\nbe granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou\nunderstand thus much English, canst thou love me?\nKATHARINE\nI cannot tell.\nKING HENRY V\nCan any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask\nthem. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,\nwhen you come into your closet, you'll question this\ngentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to\nher dispraise those parts in me that you love with\nyour heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the\nrather, gentle princess, because I love thee\ncruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a\nsaving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get\nthee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs\nprove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,\nbetween Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a\nboy, half French, half English, that shall go to\nConstantinople and take the Turk by the beard?\nshall we not? what sayest thou, my fair\nflower-de-luce?\nKATHARINE\nI do not know dat\nKING HENRY V\nNo; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do\nbut now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your\nFrench part of such a boy; and for my English moiety\ntake the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer\nyou, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher\net devin deesse?\nKATHARINE\nYour majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de\nmost sage demoiselle dat is en France.\nKING HENRY V\nNow, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in\ntrue English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I\ndare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to\nflatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor\nand untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew\nmy father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars\nwhen he got me: therefore was I created with a\nstubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when\nI come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,\nKate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:\nmy comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of\nbeauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou\nhast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou\nshalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:\nand therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you\nhave me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the\nthoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;\ntake me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am\nthine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine\near withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is\nthine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry\nPlantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before\nhis face, if he be not fellow with the best king,\nthou shalt find the best king of good fellows.\nCome, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is\nmusic and thy English broken; therefore, queen of\nall, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken\nEnglish; wilt thou have me?\nKATHARINE\nDat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.\nKING HENRY V\nNay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please\nhim, Kate.\nKATHARINE\nDen it sall also content me.\nKING HENRY V\nUpon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.\nKATHARINE\nLaissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je\nne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en\nbaisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne\nserviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon\ntres-puissant seigneur.\nKING HENRY V\nThen I will kiss your lips, Kate.\nKATHARINE\nLes dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant\nleur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.\nKING HENRY V\nMadam my interpreter, what says she?\nALICE\nDat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of\nFrance,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.\nKING HENRY V\nTo kiss.\nALICE\nYour majesty entendre bettre que moi.\nKING HENRY V\nIt is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss\nbefore they are married, would she say?\nALICE\nOui, vraiment.\nKING HENRY V\nO Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear\nKate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak\nlist of a country's fashion: we are the makers of\nmanners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our\nplaces stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will\ndo yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your\ncountry in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently\nand yielding.\nKissing her\n\nYou have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is\nmore eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the\ntongues of the French council; and they should\nsooner persuade Harry of England than a general\npetition of monarchs. Here comes your father.\nRe-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords\n\nBURGUNDY\nGod save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you\nour princess English?\nKING HENRY V\nI would have her learn, my fair cousin, how\nperfectly I love her; and that is good English.\nBURGUNDY\nIs she not apt?\nKING HENRY V\nOur tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not\nsmooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the\nheart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up\nthe spirit of love in her, that he will appear in\nhis true likeness.\nBURGUNDY\nPardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you\nfor that. If you would conjure in her, you must\nmake a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true\nlikeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you\nblame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the\nvirgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the\nappearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing\nself? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid\nto consign to.\nKING HENRY V\nYet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.\nBURGUNDY\nThey are then excused, my lord, when they see not\nwhat they do.\nKING HENRY V\nThen, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.\nBURGUNDY\nI will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will\nteach her to know my meaning: for maids, well\nsummered and warm kept, are like flies at\nBartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their\neyes; and then they will endure handling, which\nbefore would not abide looking on.\nKING HENRY V\nThis moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;\nand so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the\nlatter end and she must be blind too.\nBURGUNDY\nAs love is, my lord, before it loves.\nKING HENRY V\nIt is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for\nmy blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city\nfor one fair French maid that stands in my way.\nFRENCH KING\nYes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities\nturned into a maid; for they are all girdled with\nmaiden walls that war hath never entered.\nKING HENRY V\nShall Kate be my wife?\nFRENCH KING\nSo please you.\nKING HENRY V\nI am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may\nwait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for\nmy wish shall show me the way to my will.\nFRENCH KING\nWe have consented to all terms of reason.\nKING HENRY V\nIs't so, my lords of England?\nWESTMORELAND\nThe king hath granted every article:\nHis daughter first, and then in sequel all,\nAccording to their firm proposed natures.\nEXETER\nOnly he hath not yet subscribed this:\nWhere your majesty demands, that the King of France,\nhaving any occasion to write for matter of grant,\nshall name your highness in this form and with this\naddition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi\nd'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in\nLatin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex\nAngliae, et Haeres Franciae.\nFRENCH KING\nNor this I have not, brother, so denied,\nBut your request shall make me let it pass.\nKING HENRY V\nI pray you then, in love and dear alliance,\nLet that one article rank with the rest;\nAnd thereupon give me your daughter.\nFRENCH KING\nTake her, fair son, and from her blood raise up\nIssue to me; that the contending kingdoms\nOf France and England, whose very shores look pale\nWith envy of each other's happiness,\nMay cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction\nPlant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord\nIn their sweet bosoms, that never war advance\nHis bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.\nALL\nAmen!\nKING HENRY V\nNow, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,\nThat here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.\nFlourish\n\nQUEEN ISABEL\nGod, the best maker of all marriages,\nCombine your hearts in one, your realms in one!\nAs man and wife, being two, are one in love,\nSo be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,\nThat never may ill office, or fell jealousy,\nWhich troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,\nThrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,\nTo make divorce of their incorporate league;\nThat English may as French, French Englishmen,\nReceive each other. God speak this Amen!\nALL\nAmen!\nKING HENRY V\nPrepare we for our marriage--on which day,\nMy Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,\nAnd all the peers', for surety of our leagues.\nThen shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;\nAnd may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!\nSennet.
