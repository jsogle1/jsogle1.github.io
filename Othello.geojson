    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Venice. A street.\nEnter Roderigo and Iago.\n\nRODERIGO.\nTush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\n\nIAGO.\n’Sblood, but you will not hear me.\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter,\nAbhor me.\n\nRODERIGO.\nThou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.\n\nIAGO.\nDespise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\nOff-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man,\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\nEvades them, with a bombast circumstance,\nHorribly stuff’d with epithets of war:\nAnd in conclusion,\nNonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he,\n“I have already chose my officer.”\nAnd what was he?\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\nA fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife,\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\nNor the division of a battle knows\nMore than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\nAs masterly as he: mere prattle without practice\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,\nChristian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d\nBy debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\nAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.\n\nRODERIGO.\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service,\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\nStood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself\nWhether I in any just term am affin’d\nTo love the Moor.\n\nRODERIGO.\nI would not follow him, then.\n\nIAGO.\nO, sir, content you.\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\nCannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\nWears out his time, much like his master’s ass,\nFor nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.\nWhip me such honest knaves. Others there are\nWho, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty,\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\nAnd throwing but shows of service on their lords,\nDo well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats,\nDo themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\nBut seeming so for my peculiar end.\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\nThe native act and figure of my heart\nIn complement extern, ’tis not long after\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\nFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,\nIf he can carry’t thus!\n\nIAGO.\nCall up her father,\nRouse him, make after him, poison his delight,\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\nAnd though he in a fertile climate dwell,\nPlague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\nYet throw such changes of vexation on’t,\nAs it may lose some color.\n\nRODERIGO.\nHere is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.\n\nIAGO.\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\nIs spied in populous cities.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWhat ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!\n\nIAGO.\nAwake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!\nLook to your house, your daughter, and your bags!\nThieves, thieves!\n\nBrabantio appears above at a window.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?\nWhat is the matter there?\n\nRODERIGO.\nSignior, is all your family within?\n\nIAGO.\nAre your doors locked?\n\nBRABANTIO.\nWhy, wherefore ask you this?\n\nIAGO.\nZounds, sir, you’re robb’d, for shame put on your gown,\nYour heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;\nEven now, now, very now, an old black ram\nIs tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,\nAwake the snorting citizens with the bell,\nOr else the devil will make a grandsire of you:\nArise, I say.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nWhat, have you lost your wits?\n\nRODERIGO.\nMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?\n\nBRABANTIO.\nNot I. What are you?\n\nRODERIGO.\nMy name is Roderigo.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nThe worser welcome.\nI have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors;\nIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say\nMy daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,\nBeing full of supper and distempering draughts,\nUpon malicious bravery, dost thou come\nTo start my quiet.\n\nRODERIGO.\nSir, sir, sir,—\n\nBRABANTIO.\nBut thou must needs be sure\nMy spirit and my place have in them power\nTo make this bitter to thee.\n\nRODERIGO.\nPatience, good sir.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nWhat tell’st thou me of robbing?\nThis is Venice. My house is not a grange.\n\nRODERIGO.\nMost grave Brabantio,\nIn simple and pure soul I come to you.\n\nIAGO.\nZounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse; you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nWhat profane wretch art thou?\n\nIAGO.\nI am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nThou art a villain.\n\nIAGO.\nYou are a senator.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nThis thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.\n\nRODERIGO.\nSir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,\nIf ’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,\n(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,\nTransported with no worse nor better guard,\nBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,\nTo the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:\nIf this be known to you, and your allowance,\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me,\nWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe\nThat from the sense of all civility,\nI thus would play and trifle with your reverence.\nYour daughter (if you have not given her leave)\nI say again, hath made a gross revolt,\nTying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger\nOf here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:\nIf she be in her chamber or your house,\nLet loose on me the justice of the state\nFor thus deluding you.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nStrike on the tinder, ho!\nGive me a taper! Call up all my people!\nThis accident is not unlike my dream,\nBelief of it oppresses me already.\nLight, I say, light!\n\n[Exit from above.]\n\nIAGO.\nFarewell; for I must leave you:\nIt seems not meet nor wholesome to my place\nTo be produc’d, as if I stay I shall,\nAgainst the Moor. For I do know the state,\nHowever this may gall him with some check,\nCannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d\nWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\nWhich even now stand in act, that, for their souls,\nAnother of his fathom they have none\nTo lead their business. In which regard,\nThough I do hate him as I do hell pains,\nYet, for necessity of present life,\nI must show out a flag and sign of love,\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\nLead to the Sagittary the raised search,\nAnd there will I be with him. So, farewell.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Brabantio with Servants and torches.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nIt is too true an evil. Gone she is,\nAnd what’s to come of my despised time,\nIs naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo,\nWhere didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)\nWith the Moor, say’st thou? (Who would be a father!)\nHow didst thou know ’twas she? (O, she deceives me\nPast thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers,\nRaise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?\n\nRODERIGO.\nTruly I think they are.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!\nFathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds\nBy what you see them act. Is there not charms\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\nMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\nOf some such thing?\n\nRODERIGO.\nYes, sir, I have indeed.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nCall up my brother. O, would you had had her!\nSome one way, some another. Do you know\nWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?\n\nRODERIGO.\nI think I can discover him, if you please\nTo get good guard, and go along with me.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nPray you lead on. At every house I’ll call,\nI may command at most. Get weapons, ho!\nAnd raise some special officers of night.\nOn, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Another street.\nEnter Othello, Iago and Attendants with torches.\n\nIAGO.\nThough in the trade of war I have slain men,\nYet do I hold it very stuff o’ the conscience\nTo do no contriv’d murder; I lack iniquity\nSometimes to do me service: nine or ten times\nI had thought to have yerk’d him here under the ribs.\n\nOTHELLO.\n’Tis better as it is.\n\nIAGO.\nNay, but he prated,\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\nAgainst your honour,\nThat with the little godliness I have,\nI did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,\nAre you fast married? Be assur’d of this,\nThat the magnifico is much belov’d\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\nAs double as the duke’s; he will divorce you,\nOr put upon you what restraint and grievance\nThe law (with all his might to enforce it on)\nWill give him cable.\n\nOTHELLO.\nLet him do his spite;\nMy services, which I have done the signiory,\nShall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know,—\nWhich, when I know that boasting is an honour,\nI shall promulgate,—I fetch my life and being\nFrom men of royal siege. And my demerits\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\nAs this that I have reach’d.

But look, what lights come yond?\n\nIAGO.\nThose are the raised father and his friends:\nYou were best go in.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNot I; I must be found.\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul\nShall manifest me rightly.

The galleys\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\nThis very night at one another’s heels;\nAnd many of the consuls, rais’d and met,\nAre at the duke’s already. You have been hotly call’d for,\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found,\nThe senate hath sent about three several quests\nTo search you out.\n\nOTHELLO.\n’Tis well I am found by you.\nI will but spend a word here in the house,\nAnd go with you.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCASSIO.\nAncient, what makes he here?\n\nIAGO.\nFaith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack:\nIf it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.\n\nCASSIO.\nI do not understand.\n\nIAGO.\nHe’s married.\n\nCASSIO.\nTo who?\n\nEnter Othello.\n\nIAGO.\nMarry to—Come, captain, will you go?\n\nOTHELLO.\nHave with you.\n\nCASSIO.\nHere comes another troop to seek for you.\n\nEnter Brabantio, Roderigo and Officers with torches and weapons.\n\nIAGO.\nIt is Brabantio.

I’ll have’t disputed on;\n’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee\nFor an abuser of the world, a practiser\nOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.—\nLay hold upon him, if he do resist,\nSubdue him at his peril.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHold your hands,\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest:\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it\nWithout a prompter.

    "content":"SCENE III. Venice. A council chamber.\nThe Duke and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending.\n\nDUKE.\nThere is no composition in these news\nThat gives them credit.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nIndeed, they are disproportion’d;\nMy letters say a hundred and seven galleys.\n\nDUKE.\nAnd mine a hundred and forty.\n\nSECOND SENATOR\nAnd mine two hundred:\nBut though they jump not on a just account,\n(As in these cases, where the aim reports,\n’Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\n\nDUKE.\nNay, it is possible enough to judgement:\nI do not so secure me in the error,\nBut the main article I do approve\nIn fearful sense.\n\nSAILOR.\n[Within.] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!\n\nOFFICER.\nA messenger from the galleys.\n\nEnter Sailor.\n\nDUKE.\nNow,—what’s the business?\n\nSAILOR.\nThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,\nSo was I bid report here to the state\nBy Signior Angelo.\n\nDUKE.\nHow say you by this change?\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nThis cannot be\nBy no assay of reason. ’Tis a pageant\nTo keep us in false gaze. When we consider\nThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;\nAnd let ourselves again but understand\nThat, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\nSo may he with more facile question bear it,\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace,\nBut altogether lacks the abilities\nThat Rhodes is dress’d in. If we make thought of this,\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskilful\nTo leave that latest which concerns him first,\nNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain,\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless.\n\nDUKE.\nNay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.\n\nOFFICER.\nHere is more news.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe Ottomites, reverend and gracious,\nSteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,\nHave there injointed them with an after fleet.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\n\nMESSENGER.\nOf thirty sail, and now they do re-stem\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\nYour trusty and most valiant servitor,\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\nAnd prays you to believe him.\n\nDUKE.\n’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\nMarcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nHe’s now in Florence.\n\nDUKE.\nWrite from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\n\nEnter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo and Officers.\n\nDUKE.\nValiant Othello, we must straight employ you\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.\n[To Brabantio.] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior,\nWe lack’d your counsel and your help tonight.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nSo did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me.\nNeither my place, nor aught I heard of business\nHath rais’d me from my bed, nor doth the general care\nTake hold on me; for my particular grief\nIs of so flood-gate and o’erbearing nature\nThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows,\nAnd it is still itself.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy, what’s the matter?\n\nBRABANTIO.\nMy daughter! O, my daughter!\n\nDUKE and SENATORS.\nDead?\n\nBRABANTIO.\nAy, to me.\nShe is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted\nBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\nFor nature so preposterously to err,\nBeing not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,\nSans witchcraft could not.\n\nDUKE.\nWhoe’er he be, that in this foul proceeding,\nHath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself,\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\nYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter,\nAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper son\nStood in your action.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nHumbly I thank your grace.\nHere is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems\nYour special mandate for the state affairs\nHath hither brought.\n\nALL.\nWe are very sorry for ’t.\n\nDUKE.\n[To Othello.] What, in your own part, can you say to this?\n\nBRABANTIO.\nNothing, but this is so.\n\nOTHELLO.\nMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\nMy very noble and approv’d good masters:\nThat I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,\nIt is most true; true, I have married her.\nThe very head and front of my offending\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\nAnd little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace;\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d\nTheir dearest action in the tented field,\nAnd little of this great world can I speak,\nMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle,\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause\nIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,\nI will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver\nOf my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,\nWhat conjuration, and what mighty magic,\n(For such proceeding I am charged withal)\nI won his daughter.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nA maiden never bold:\nOf spirit so still and quiet that her motion\nBlush’d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\nTo fall in love with what she fear’d to look on!\nIt is judgement maim’d and most imperfect\nThat will confess perfection so could err\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\nTo find out practices of cunning hell,\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch again,\nThat with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,\nOr with some dram conjur’d to this effect,\nHe wrought upon her.\n\nDUKE.\nTo vouch this is no proof;\nWithout more wider and more overt test\nThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods\nOf modern seeming do prefer against him.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nBut, Othello, speak:\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\nSubdue and poison this young maid’s affections?\nOr came it by request, and such fair question\nAs soul to soul affordeth?\n\nOTHELLO.\nI do beseech you,\nSend for the lady to the Sagittary,\nAnd let her speak of me before her father.\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\nThe trust, the office I do hold of you,\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\nEven fall upon my life.\n\nDUKE.\nFetch Desdemona hither.\n\nOTHELLO.\nAncient, conduct them, you best know the place.\n\n[Exeunt Iago and Attendants.]\n\nAnd till she come, as truly as to heaven\nI do confess the vices of my blood,\nSo justly to your grave ears I’ll present\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,\nAnd she in mine.\n\nDUKE.\nSay it, Othello.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHer father lov’d me, oft invited me,\nStill question’d me the story of my life,\nFrom year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes,\nThat I have pass’d.\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days\nTo the very moment that he bade me tell it,\nWherein I spake of most disastrous chances,\nOf moving accidents by flood and field;\nOf hair-breadth scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach;\nOf being taken by the insolent foe,\nAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,\nAnd portance in my traveler’s history,\nWherein of antres vast and deserts idle,\nRough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,\nIt was my hint to speak,—such was the process;\nAnd of the Cannibals that each other eat,\nThe Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\nDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear\nWould Desdemona seriously incline.\nBut still the house affairs would draw her thence,\nWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch,\nShe’d come again, and with a greedy ear\nDevour up my discourse; which I observing,\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\nThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\nBut not intentively. I did consent,\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears,\nWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke\nThat my youth suffer’d. My story being done,\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs.\nShe swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange;\n’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.\nShe wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d\nThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,\nI should but teach him how to tell my story,\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\nShe lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d,\nAnd I lov’d her that she did pity them.\nThis only is the witchcraft I have us’d.\nHere comes the lady. Let her witness it.\n\nEnter Desdemona, Iago and Attendants.\n\nDUKE.\nI think this tale would win my daughter too.\nGood Brabantio,\nTake up this mangled matter at the best.\nMen do their broken weapons rather use\nThan their bare hands.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nI pray you hear her speak.\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\nDestruction on my head, if my bad blame\nLight on the man!—Come hither, gentle mistress:\nDo you perceive in all this noble company\nWhere most you owe obedience?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nMy noble father,\nI do perceive here a divided duty:\nTo you I am bound for life and education.\nMy life and education both do learn me\nHow to respect you. You are the lord of duty,\nI am hitherto your daughter: but here’s my husband.\nAnd so much duty as my mother show’d\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\nSo much I challenge that I may profess\nDue to the Moor my lord.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nGod be with you! I have done.\nPlease it your grace, on to the state affairs.\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it.—\nCome hither, Moor:\nI here do give thee that with all my heart\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\nI would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel,\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\nTo hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nLet me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers\nInto your favour.\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\nTo mourn a mischief that is past and gone\nIs the next way to draw new mischief on.\nWhat cannot be preserved when fortune takes,\nPatience her injury a mockery makes.\nThe robb’d that smiles steals something from the thief;\nHe robs himself that spends a bootless grief.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile;\nHe bears the sentence well, that nothing bears\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears;\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.\nThese sentences to sugar or to gall,\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal:\nBut words are words; I never yet did hear\nThat the bruis’d heart was pierced through the ear.\nI humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.\n\nDUKE.\nThe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.\n\nOTHELLO.\nThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war\nMy thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize\nA natural and prompt alacrity\nI find in hardness, and do undertake\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\nMost humbly, therefore, bending to your state,\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\nDue reference of place and exhibition,\nWith such accommodation and besort\nAs levels with her breeding.\n\nDUKE.\nIf you please,\nBe’t at her father’s.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nI’ll not have it so.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNor I.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nNor I. I would not there reside,\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts,\nBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,\nTo my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice\nT’ assist my simpleness.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat would you, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nThat I did love the Moor to live with him,\nMy downright violence and storm of fortunes\nMay trumpet to the world: my heart’s subdued\nEven to the very quality of my lord.\nI saw Othello’s visage in his mind,\nAnd to his honours and his valiant parts\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind,\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\nThe rites for which I love him are bereft me,\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support\nBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.\n\nOTHELLO.\nLet her have your voice.\nVouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\nNor to comply with heat, the young affects\nIn me defunct, and proper satisfaction,\nBut to be free and bounteous to her mind.\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\nI will your serious and great business scant\nFor she is with me. No, when light-wing’d toys\nOf feather’d Cupid seel with wanton dullness\nMy speculative and offic’d instruments,\nThat my disports corrupt and taint my business,\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\nAnd all indign and base adversities\nMake head against my estimation.\n\nDUKE.\nBe it as you shall privately determine,\nEither for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,\nAnd speed must answer it.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nYou must away tonight.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWith all my heart.\n\nDUKE.\nAt nine i’ the morning here we’ll meet again.\nOthello, leave some officer behind,\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\nWith such things else of quality and respect\nAs doth import you.\n\nOTHELLO.\nSo please your grace, my ancient,\nA man he is of honesty and trust,\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife,\nWith what else needful your good grace shall think\nTo be sent after me.\n\nDUKE.\nLet it be so.\nGood night to everyone. [To Brabantio.] And, noble signior,\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black.\n\nFIRST SENATOR.\nAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\n\nBRABANTIO.\nLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:\nShe has deceiv’d her father, and may thee.\n\n[Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &c.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nMy life upon her faith! Honest Iago,\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee.\nI prithee, let thy wife attend on her,\nAnd bring them after in the best advantage.—\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction,\nTo spend with thee. We must obey the time.\n\n[Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.]\n\nRODERIGO.\nIago—\n\nIAGO.\nWhat sayst thou, noble heart?\n\nRODERIGO.\nWhat will I do, thinkest thou?\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, go to bed and sleep.\n\nRODERIGO.\nI will incontinently drown myself.\n\nIAGO.\nIf thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!\n\nRODERIGO.\nIt is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.\n\nIAGO.\nO villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWhat should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.\n\nIAGO.\nVirtue! a fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to be a sect, or scion.\n\nRODERIGO.\nIt cannot be.\n\nIAGO.\nIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put money in thy purse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?\n\nIAGO.\nThou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWhere shall we meet i’ the morning?\n\nIAGO.\nAt my lodging.\n\nRODERIGO.\nI’ll be with thee betimes.\n\nIAGO.\nGo to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO.\nWhat say you?\n\nIAGO.\nNo more of drowning, do you hear?\n\nRODERIGO.\nI am changed. I’ll sell all my land.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nIAGO.\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse.\nFor I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe\nBut for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,\nAnd it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets\nHe has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,\nBut I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\nWill do as if for surety. He holds me well,\nThe better shall my purpose work on him.\nCassio’s a proper man. Let me see now,\nTo get his place, and to plume up my will\nIn double knavery. How, how? Let’s see.\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello’s ear\nThat he is too familiar with his wife.\nHe hath a person and a smooth dispose,\nTo be suspected, fram’d to make women false.\nThe Moor is of a free and open nature\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\nAnd will as tenderly be led by the nose\nAs asses are.\nI have’t. It is engender’d. Hell and night\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.\n\n[Exit.]",

A Platform.\nEnter Montano and two Gentlemen.\n\nMONTANO.\nWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nNothing at all, it is a high-wrought flood.\nI cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main\nDescry a sail.\n\nMONTANO.\nMethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.\nA fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements.\nIf it hath ruffian’d so upon the sea,\nWhat ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,\nCan hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nA segregation of the Turkish fleet.\nFor do but stand upon the foaming shore,\nThe chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,\nThe wind-shak’d surge, with high and monstrous main,\nSeems to cast water on the burning Bear,\nAnd quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole;\nI never did like molestation view\nOn the enchafed flood.\n\nMONTANO.\nIf that the Turkish fleet\nBe not enshelter’d, and embay’d, they are drown’d.\nIt is impossible to bear it out.\n\nEnter a third Gentleman.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nNews, lads! Our wars are done.\nThe desperate tempest hath so bang’d the Turks\nThat their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice\nHath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance\nOn most part of their fleet.\n\nMONTANO.\nHow? Is this true?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nThe ship is here put in,\nA Veronessa; Michael Cassio,\nLieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\nIs come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,\nAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.\n\nMONTANO.\nI am glad on’t. ’Tis a worthy governor.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nBut this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort\nTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,\nAnd prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted\nWith foul and violent tempest.\n\nMONTANO.\nPray heavens he be;\nFor I have serv’d him, and the man commands\nLike a full soldier. Let’s to the sea-side, ho!\nAs well to see the vessel that’s come in\nAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\nEven till we make the main and the aerial blue\nAn indistinct regard.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\nCome, let’s do so;\nFor every minute is expectancy\nOf more arrivance.\n\nEnter Cassio.\n\nCASSIO.\nThanks you, the valiant of this warlike isle,\nThat so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens\nGive him defence against the elements,\nFor I have lost him on a dangerous sea.\n\nMONTANO.\nIs he well shipp’d?\n\nCASSIO.\nHis bark is stoutly timber’d, and his pilot\nOf very expert and approv’d allowance;\nTherefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,\nStand in bold cure.\n\n[Within.] A sail, a sail, a sail!\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nCASSIO.\nWhat noise?\n\nMESSENGER.\nThe town is empty; on the brow o’ the sea\nStand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!”\n\nCASSIO.\nMy hopes do shape him for the governor.\n\n[A shot.]\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nThey do discharge their shot of courtesy.\nOur friends at least.\n\nCASSIO.\nI pray you, sir, go forth,\nAnd give us truth who ’tis that is arriv’d.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nI shall.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nMONTANO.\nBut, good lieutenant, is your general wiv’d?\n\nCASSIO.\nMost fortunately: he hath achiev’d a maid\nThat paragons description and wild fame,\nOne that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,\nAnd in the essential vesture of creation\nDoes tire the ingener.\n\nEnter second Gentleman.\n\nHow now? Who has put in?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\n’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.\n\nCASSIO.\nHe has had most favourable and happy speed:\nTempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,\nThe gutter’d rocks, and congregated sands,\nTraitors ensteep’d to clog the guiltless keel,\nAs having sense of beauty, do omit\nTheir mortal natures, letting go safely by\nThe divine Desdemona.\n\nMONTANO.\nWhat is she?\n\nCASSIO.\nShe that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,\nLeft in the conduct of the bold Iago;\nWhose footing here anticipates our thoughts\nA se’nnight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,\nAnd swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,\nThat he may bless this bay with his tall ship,\nMake love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,\nGive renew’d fire to our extincted spirits,\nAnd bring all Cyprus comfort!\n\nEnter Desdemona, Iago, Roderigo, and Emilia.\n\nO, behold,\nThe riches of the ship is come on shore!\nYe men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.\nHail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,\nBefore, behind thee, and on every hand,\nEnwheel thee round!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI thank you, valiant Cassio.\nWhat tidings can you tell me of my lord?\n\nCASSIO.\nHe is not yet arrived, nor know I aught\nBut that he’s well, and will be shortly here.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nO, but I fear—How lost you company?\n\n[Within.] A sail, a sail!\n\nCASSIO.\nThe great contention of the sea and skies\nParted our fellowship. But, hark! a sail.\n\n[Guns within.]\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nThey give their greeting to the citadel.\nThis likewise is a friend.\n\nCASSIO.\nSee for the news.\n\n[Exit Gentleman.]\n\nGood ancient, you are welcome. [To Emilia.] Welcome, mistress.\nLet it not gall your patience, good Iago,\nThat I extend my manners; ’tis my breeding\nThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.\n\n[Kissing her.]\n\nIAGO.\nSir, would she give you so much of her lips\nAs of her tongue she oft bestows on me,\nYou would have enough.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAlas, she has no speech.\n\nIAGO.\nIn faith, too much.\nI find it still when I have list to sleep.\nMarry, before your ladyship, I grant,\nShe puts her tongue a little in her heart,\nAnd chides with thinking.\n\nEMILIA.\nYou have little cause to say so.\n\nIAGO.\nCome on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,\nBells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens,\nSaints in your injuries, devils being offended,\nPlayers in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nO, fie upon thee, slanderer!\n\nIAGO.\nNay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.\nYou rise to play, and go to bed to work.\n\nEMILIA.\nYou shall not write my praise.\n\nIAGO.\nNo, let me not.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhat wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?\n\nIAGO.\nO gentle lady, do not put me to’t,\nFor I am nothing if not critical.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nCome on, assay.—There’s one gone to the harbour?\n\nIAGO.\nAy, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI am not merry, but I do beguile\nThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise.—\nCome, how wouldst thou praise me?\n\nIAGO.\nI am about it, but indeed, my invention\nComes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze,\nIt plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,\nAnd thus she is deliver’d.\nIf she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,\nThe one’s for use, the other useth it.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWell prais’d! How if she be black and witty?\n\nIAGO.\nIf she be black, and thereto have a wit,\nShe’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWorse and worse.\n\nEMILIA.\nHow if fair and foolish?\n\nIAGO.\nShe never yet was foolish that was fair,\nFor even her folly help’d her to an heir.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nThese are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i’ the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish?\n\nIAGO.\nThere’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,\nBut does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nO heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?\n\nIAGO.\nShe that was ever fair and never proud,\nHad tongue at will and yet was never loud,\nNever lack’d gold and yet went never gay,\nFled from her wish, and yet said, “Now I may”;\nShe that, being anger’d, her revenge being nigh,\nBade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;\nShe that in wisdom never was so frail\nTo change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail;\nShe that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,\nSee suitors following and not look behind;\nShe was a wight, if ever such wight were—\n\nDESDEMONA.\nTo do what?\n\nIAGO.\nTo suckle fools and chronicle small beer.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nO most lame and impotent conclusion!—Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband.—How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor?\n\nCASSIO.\nHe speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.\n\nIAGO.\n[Aside.] He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said, whisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do. I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, ’tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed, an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!\n\n[Trumpets within.]\n\nThe Moor! I know his trumpet.\n\nCASSIO.\n’Tis truly so.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nLet’s meet him, and receive him.\n\nCASSIO.\nLo, where he comes!\n\nEnter Othello and Attendants.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO my fair warrior!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nMy dear Othello!\n\nOTHELLO.\nIt gives me wonder great as my content\nTo see you here before me. O my soul’s joy!\nIf after every tempest come such calms,\nMay the winds blow till they have waken’d death!\nAnd let the labouring bark climb hills of seas\nOlympus-high, and duck again as low\nAs hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,\n’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear\nMy soul hath her content so absolute\nThat not another comfort like to this\nSucceeds in unknown fate.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nThe heavens forbid\nBut that our loves and comforts should increase\nEven as our days do grow!\n\nOTHELLO.\nAmen to that, sweet powers!\nI cannot speak enough of this content.\nIt stops me here; it is too much of joy:\nAnd this, and this, the greatest discords be [They kiss.]\nThat e’er our hearts shall make!\n\nIAGO.\n[Aside.] O, you are well tun’d now,\nBut I’ll set down the pegs that make this music,\nAs honest as I am.\n\nOTHELLO.\nCome, let us to the castle.—\nNews, friends, our wars are done, the Turks are drown’d.\nHow does my old acquaintance of this isle?\nHoney, you shall be well desir’d in Cyprus;\nI have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote\nIn mine own comforts.—I prithee, good Iago,\nGo to the bay and disembark my coffers.\nBring thou the master to the citadel;\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\nDoes challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona,\nOnce more well met at Cyprus.\n\n[Exeunt Othello, Desdemona and Attendants.]\n\nIAGO.\nDo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be’st valiant—as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them—list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard: first, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWith him? Why, ’tis not possible.\n\nIAGO.\nLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself: a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.\n\nRODERIGO.\nI cannot believe that in her, she is full of most blessed condition.\n\nIAGO.\nBlest fig’s end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?\n\nRODERIGO.\nYes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.\n\nIAGO.\nLechery, by this hand. An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac’d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight. For the command, I’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favourably minister.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWell.\n\nIAGO.\nSir, he is rash, and very sudden in choler, and haply with his truncheon may strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.\n\nRODERIGO.\nI will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.\n\nIAGO.\nI warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.\n\nRODERIGO.\nAdieu.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nIAGO.\nThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\nThat she loves him, ’tis apt, and of great credit:\nThe Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\nIs of a constant, loving, noble nature;\nAnd, I dare think, he’ll prove to Desdemona\nA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,\nNot out of absolute lust (though peradventure\nI stand accountant for as great a sin)\nBut partly led to diet my revenge,\nFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\nHath leap’d into my seat. The thought whereof\nDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,\nAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\nTill I am even’d with him, wife for wife,\nOr, failing so, yet that I put the Moor\nAt least into a jealousy so strong\nThat judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,\nIf this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,\nI’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,\nAbuse him to the Moor in the rank garb\n(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)\nMake the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me\nFor making him egregiously an ass\nAnd practicing upon his peace and quiet\nEven to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confus’d.\nKnavery’s plain face is never seen till us’d.\n\n[Exit.]",

Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and she is sport for Jove.\n\nCASSIO.\nShe’s a most exquisite lady.\n\nIAGO.\nAnd, I’ll warrant her, full of game.\n\nCASSIO.\nIndeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature.\n\nIAGO.\nWhat an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.\n\nCASSIO.\nAn inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.\n\nIAGO.\nAnd when she speaks, is it not an alarm to love?\n\nCASSIO.\nShe is indeed perfection.\n\nIAGO.\nWell, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.\n\nCASSIO.\nNot tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.\n\nIAGO.\nO, they are our friends; but one cup: I’ll drink for you.\n\nCASSIO.\nI have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.\n\nIAGO.\nWhat, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants desire it.\n\nCASSIO.\nWhere are they?\n\nIAGO.\nHere at the door. I pray you, call them in.\n\nCASSIO.\nI’ll do’t; but it dislikes me.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nIAGO.\nIf I can fasten but one cup upon him,\nWith that which he hath drunk tonight already,\nHe’ll be as full of quarrel and offence\nAs my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,\nWhom love hath turn’d almost the wrong side out,\nTo Desdemona hath tonight carous’d\nPotations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch:\nThree lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,\nThat hold their honours in a wary distance,\nThe very elements of this warlike isle,\nHave I tonight fluster’d with flowing cups,\nAnd they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards,\nAm I to put our Cassio in some action\nThat may offend the isle. But here they come:\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\nMy boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.\n\nEnter Cassio, Montano and Gentlemen; followed by Servant with wine.\n\nCASSIO.\n’Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.\n\nMONTANO.\nGood faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.\n\nIAGO.\nSome wine, ho!\n[Sings.]\n\n    And let me the cannikin clink, clink,\n    And let me the cannikin clink, clink:\n        A soldier’s a man,\n        O, man’s life’s but a span,\n    Why then let a soldier drink.\n\nSome wine, boys!\n\nCASSIO.\n’Fore God, an excellent song.\n\nIAGO.\nI learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander,—drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.\n\nCASSIO.\nIs your Englishman so expert in his drinking?\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.\n\nCASSIO.\nTo the health of our general!\n\nMONTANO.\nI am for it, lieutenant; and I’ll do you justice.\n\nIAGO.\nO sweet England!\n\n[Sings.]\n\n    King Stephen was a worthy peer,\n        His breeches cost him but a crown;\n    He held them sixpence all too dear,\n        With that he call’d the tailor lown.\n    He was a wight of high renown,\n        And thou art but of low degree:\n    ’Tis pride that pulls the country down,\n        Then take thine auld cloak about thee.\n\nSome wine, ho!\n\nCASSIO.\n’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than the other.\n\nIAGO.\nWill you hear ’t again?\n\nCASSIO.\nNo, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, God’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.\n\nIAGO.\nIt’s true, good lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO.\nFor mine own part, no offence to the general, nor any man of quality, I hope to be saved.\n\nIAGO.\nAnd so do I too, lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO.\nAy, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let’s have no more of this; let’s to our affairs. Forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.\n\nALL.\nExcellent well.\n\nCASSIO.\nWhy, very well then. You must not think, then, that I am drunk.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nMONTANO.\nTo the platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch.\n\nIAGO.\nYou see this fellow that is gone before,\nHe is a soldier fit to stand by Cæsar\nAnd give direction: and do but see his vice,\n’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,\nThe one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him.\nI fear the trust Othello puts him in,\nOn some odd time of his infirmity,\nWill shake this island.\n\nMONTANO.\nBut is he often thus?\n\nIAGO.\n’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:\nHe’ll watch the horologe a double set\nIf drink rock not his cradle.\n\nMONTANO.\nIt were well\nThe general were put in mind of it.\nPerhaps he sees it not, or his good nature\nPrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,\nAnd looks not on his evils: is not this true?\n\nEnter Roderigo.\n\nIAGO.\n[Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo?\nI pray you, after the lieutenant; go.\n\n[Exit Roderigo.]\n\nMONTANO.\nAnd ’tis great pity that the noble Moor\nShould hazard such a place as his own second\nWith one of an ingraft infirmity:\nIt were an honest action to say so\nTo the Moor.\n\nIAGO.\nNot I, for this fair island.\nI do love Cassio well and would do much\nTo cure him of this evil. But, hark! What noise?\n\n[Cry within: “Help! help!”]\n\nEnter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.\n\nCASSIO.\nZounds, you rogue, you rascal!\n\nMONTANO.\nWhat’s the matter, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO.\nA knave teach me my duty! I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.\n\nRODERIGO.\nBeat me?\n\nCASSIO.\nDost thou prate, rogue?\n\n[Striking Roderigo.]\n\nMONTANO.\nNay, good lieutenant;\nI pray you, sir, hold your hand.\n\nCASSIO.\nLet me go, sir,\nOr I’ll knock you o’er the mazard.\n\nMONTANO.\nCome, come, you’re drunk.\n\nCASSIO.\nDrunk?\n\n[They fight.]\n\nIAGO.\n[Aside to Roderigo.] Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.\n\n[Exit Roderigo.]\n\nNay, good lieutenant, God’s will, gentlemen.\nHelp, ho!—Lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—sir:—\nHelp, masters! Here’s a goodly watch indeed!\n\n[A bell rings.]\n\nWho’s that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!\nThe town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold,\nYou will be sham’d forever.\n\nEnter Othello and Attendants.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat is the matter here?\n\nMONTANO.\nZounds, I bleed still, I am hurt to the death.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHold, for your lives!\n\nIAGO.\nHold, ho! lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—gentlemen,—\nHave you forgot all place of sense and duty?\nHold! The general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhy, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?\nAre we turn’d Turks, and to ourselves do that\nWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:\nHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage\nHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.\nSilence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,\nSpeak, who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.\n\nIAGO.\nI do not know. Friends all but now, even now,\nIn quarter, and in terms like bride and groom\nDevesting them for bed; and then, but now,\nAs if some planet had unwitted men,\nSwords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\nAny beginning to this peevish odds;\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\nThose legs that brought me to a part of it!\n\nOTHELLO.\nHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?\n\nCASSIO.\nI pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil.\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\nThe world hath noted, and your name is great\nIn mouths of wisest censure: what’s the matter,\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\nAnd spend your rich opinion for the name\nOf a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.\n\nMONTANO.\nWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.\nYour officer, Iago, can inform you,\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends me,\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\nBy me that’s said or done amiss this night,\nUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin\nWhen violence assails us.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNow, by heaven,\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\nAnd passion, having my best judgement collied,\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you\nShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on,\nAnd he that is approv’d in this offence,\nThough he had twinn’d with me, both at a birth,\nShall lose me. What! in a town of war,\nYet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,\nTo manage private and domestic quarrel,\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\n’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began’t?\n\nMONTANO.\nIf partially affin’d, or leagu’d in office,\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\nThou art no soldier.\n\nIAGO.\nTouch me not so near.\nI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\nThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio.\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\nMontano and myself being in speech,\nThere comes a fellow crying out for help,\nAnd Cassio following him with determin’d sword,\nTo execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\nSteps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue,\nLest by his clamour (as it so fell out)\nThe town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,\nOutran my purpose: and I return’d the rather\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,\nAnd Cassio high in oath, which till tonight\nI ne’er might say before. When I came back,\n(For this was brief) I found them close together,\nAt blow and thrust, even as again they were\nWhen you yourself did part them.\nMore of this matter cannot I report.\nBut men are men; the best sometimes forget;\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv’d\nFrom him that fled some strange indignity,\nWhich patience could not pass.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI know, Iago,\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\nMaking it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,\nBut never more be officer of mine.\n\nEnter Desdemona, attended.\n\nLook, if my gentle love be not rais’d up!\nI’ll make thee an example.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nOTHELLO.\nAll’s well now, sweeting; come away to bed.\nSir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.\nLead him off.\n[Montano is led off.]\n\nIago, look with care about the town,\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.\nCome, Desdemona: ’tis the soldiers’ life\nTo have their balmy slumbers wak’d with strife.\n\n[Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio.]\n\nIAGO.\nWhat, are you hurt, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO.\nAy, past all surgery.\n\nIAGO.\nMarry, Heaven forbid!\n\nCASSIO.\nReputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!\n\nIAGO.\nAs I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general again: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he’s yours.\n\nCASSIO.\nI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!\n\nIAGO.\nWhat was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?\n\nCASSIO.\nI know not.\n\nIAGO.\nIs’t possible?\n\nCASSIO.\nI remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered?\n\nCASSIO.\nIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.\n\nIAGO.\nCome, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\n\nCASSIO.\nI will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unbless’d, and the ingredient is a devil.\n\nIAGO.\nCome, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.\n\nCASSIO.\nI have well approved it, sir.—I drunk!\n\nIAGO.\nYou, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general; I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.\n\nCASSIO.\nYou advise me well.\n\nIAGO.\nI protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\n\nCASSIO.\nI think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.\n\nIAGO.\nYou are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\n\nCASSIO.\nGood night, honest Iago.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nIAGO.\nAnd what’s he then, that says I play the villain?\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\nProbal to thinking, and indeed the course\nTo win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy\nThe inclining Desdemona to subdue\nIn any honest suit. She’s fram’d as fruitful\nAs the free elements. And then for her\nTo win the Moor, were’t to renounce his baptism,\nAll seals and symbols of redeemed sin,\nHis soul is so enfetter’d to her love\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\nEven as her appetite shall play the god\nWith his weak function. How am I then, a villain\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\nWhen devils will the blackest sins put on,\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\nAs I do now: for whiles this honest fool\nPlies Desdemona to repair his fortune,\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\nI’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,\nThat she repeals him for her body’s lust;\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor.\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch,\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\nThat shall enmesh them all.\n\nEnter Roderigo.\n\nHow now, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO.\nI do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.\n\nIAGO.\nHow poor are they that have not patience!\nWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees?\nThou know’st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\nDoes’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier’d Cassio;\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\nYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.\nContent thyself awhile. By the mass, ’tis morning;\nPleasure and action make the hours seem short.\nRetire thee; go where thou art billeted.\nAway, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.\nNay, get thee gone.\n\n[Exit Roderigo.]\n\nTwo things are to be done,\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.\nI’ll set her on;\nMyself the while to draw the Moor apart,\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find\nSoliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.\nDull not device by coldness and delay.\n\n[Exit.]",

I warrant it grieves my husband\nAs if the cause were his.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nO, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,\nBut I will have my lord and you again\nAs friendly as you were.\n\nCASSIO.\nBounteous madam,\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\nHe’s never anything but your true servant.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI know’t. I thank you. You do love my lord.\nYou have known him long; and be you well assur’d\nHe shall in strangeness stand no farther off\nThan in a politic distance.\n\nCASSIO.\nAy, but, lady,\nThat policy may either last so long,\nOr feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\nThat, I being absent, and my place supplied,\nMy general will forget my love and service.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nDo not doubt that. Before Emilia here\nI give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,\nIf I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it\nTo the last article. My lord shall never rest,\nI’ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\nI’ll intermingle everything he does\nWith Cassio’s suit.

Good my lord,\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\nHis present reconciliation take;\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\nThat errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\nI have no judgement in an honest face.\nI prithee call him back.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWent he hence now?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAy, sooth; so humbled\nThat he hath left part of his grief with me\nTo suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNot now, sweet Desdemon, some other time.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nBut shall’t be shortly?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThe sooner, sweet, for you.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nShall’t be tonight at supper?\n\nOTHELLO.\nNo, not tonight.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nTomorrow dinner then?\n\nOTHELLO.\nI shall not dine at home;\nI meet the captains at the citadel.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhy then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,\nOn Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn.\nI prithee name the time, but let it not\nExceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;\nAnd yet his trespass, in our common reason,\n(Save that, they say, the wars must make examples\nOut of their best) is not almost a fault\nTo incur a private check. When shall he come?\nTell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,\nWhat you would ask me, that I should deny,\nOr stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\nHath ta’en your part, to have so much to do\nTo bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.\n\nOTHELLO.\nPrithee no more. Let him come when he will;\nI will deny thee nothing.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhy, this is not a boon;\n’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\nOr sue to you to do a peculiar profit\nTo your own person: nay, when I have a suit\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\nIt shall be full of poise and difficult weight,\nAnd fearful to be granted.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI will deny thee nothing.\nWhereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nShall I deny you? No, farewell, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.\nFarewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nEmilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you.\nWhate’er you be, I am obedient.\n\n[Exit with Emilia.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nExcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,\nBut I do love thee! And when I love thee not,\nChaos is come again.\n\nIAGO.\nMy noble lord,—\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat dost thou say, Iago?\n\nIAGO.\nDid Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady,\nKnow of your love?\n\nOTHELLO.\nHe did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?\n\nIAGO.\nBut for a satisfaction of my thought.\nNo further harm.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhy of thy thought, Iago?\n\nIAGO.\nI did not think he had been acquainted with her.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO yes, and went between us very oft.\n\nIAGO.\nIndeed?\n\nOTHELLO.\nIndeed? Ay, indeed. Discern’st thou aught in that?\nIs he not honest?\n\nIAGO.\nHonest, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nHonest? ay, honest.\n\nIAGO.\nMy lord, for aught I know.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat dost thou think?\n\nIAGO.\nThink, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThink, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,\nAs if there were some monster in his thought\nToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.\nI heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,\nWhen Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed?”\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together,\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\nSome horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,\nShow me thy thought.\n\nIAGO.\nMy lord, you know I love you.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI think thou dost;\nAnd for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty\nAnd weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,\nTherefore these stops of thine fright me the more:\nFor such things in a false disloyal knave\nAre tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,\nThey’re close dilations, working from the heart,\nThat passion cannot rule.\n\nIAGO.\nFor Michael Cassio,\nI dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI think so too.\n\nIAGO.\nMen should be what they seem;\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\n\nOTHELLO.\nCertain, men should be what they seem.\n\nIAGO.\nWhy then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNay, yet there’s more in this:\nI prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,\nAs thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts\nThe worst of words.\n\nIAGO.\nGood my lord, pardon me.\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to.\nUtter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false:\nAs where’s that palace whereinto foul things\nSometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure\nBut some uncleanly apprehensions\nKeep leets and law-days, and in session sit\nWith meditations lawful?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\nIf thou but think’st him wrong’d and mak’st his ear\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO.\nI do beseech you,\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess,\nAs, I confess, it is my nature’s plague\nTo spy into abuses, and of my jealousy\nShapes faults that are not,—that your wisdom\nFrom one that so imperfectly conceits,\nWould take no notice; nor build yourself a trouble\nOut of his scattering and unsure observance.\nIt were not for your quiet nor your good,\nNor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,\nTo let you know my thoughts.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat dost thou mean?\n\nIAGO.\nGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls.\nWho steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing;\n’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.\nBut he that filches from me my good name\nRobs me of that which not enriches him\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\n\nOTHELLO.\nBy heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO.\nYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\nNor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHa?\n\nIAGO.\nO, beware, my lord, of jealousy;\nIt is the green-ey’d monster which doth mock\nThe meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\nBut O, what damned minutes tells he o’er\nWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!\n\nOTHELLO.\nO misery!\n\nIAGO.\nPoor and content is rich, and rich enough;\nBut riches fineless is as poor as winter\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\nGood heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend\nFrom jealousy!\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhy, why is this?\nThink’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\nWith fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt\nIs once to be resolv’d: exchange me for a goat\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,\nMatching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous,\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\nIs free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous:\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\nThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\nI’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this:\nAway at once with love or jealousy!\n\nIAGO.\nI am glad of it, for now I shall have reason\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\nWith franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,\nReceive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\nLook to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\nWear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.\nI would not have your free and noble nature,\nOut of self-bounty, be abus’d. Look to’t.\nI know our country disposition well;\nIn Venice they do let heaven see the pranks\nThey dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience\nIs not to leave undone, but keep unknown.\n\nOTHELLO.\nDost thou say so?\n\nIAGO.\nShe did deceive her father, marrying you;\nAnd when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,\nShe loved them most.\n\nOTHELLO.\nAnd so she did.\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, go to then.\nShe that so young could give out such a seeming,\nTo seal her father’s eyes up close as oak,\nHe thought ’twas witchcraft. But I am much to blame.\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon\nFor too much loving you.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI am bound to thee for ever.\n\nIAGO.\nI see this hath a little dash’d your spirits.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNot a jot, not a jot.\n\nIAGO.\nTrust me, I fear it has.\nI hope you will consider what is spoke\nComes from my love. But I do see you’re mov’d.\nI am to pray you not to strain my speech\nTo grosser issues nor to larger reach\nThan to suspicion.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI will not.\n\nIAGO.\nShould you do so, my lord,\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\nWhich my thoughts aim’d not. Cassio’s my worthy friend.\nMy lord, I see you’re mov’d.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNo, not much mov’d.\nI do not think but Desdemona’s honest.\n\nIAGO.\nLong live she so! And long live you to think so!\n\nOTHELLO.\nAnd yet, how nature erring from itself—\n\nIAGO.\nAy, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,\nNot to affect many proposed matches,\nOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends;\nFoh! One may smell in such a will most rank,\nFoul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.\nBut pardon me: I do not in position\nDistinctly speak of her, though I may fear\nHer will, recoiling to her better judgement,\nMay fall to match you with her country forms,\nAnd happily repent.\n\nOTHELLO.\nFarewell, farewell:\nIf more thou dost perceive, let me know more;\nSet on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.\n\nIAGO.\n[Going.] My lord, I take my leave.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\n\nIAGO.\n[Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honour\nTo scan this thing no further. Leave it to time:\nThough it be fit that Cassio have his place,\nFor sure he fills it up with great ability,\nYet if you please to hold him off awhile,\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means.\nNote if your lady strain his entertainment\nWith any strong or vehement importunity,\nMuch will be seen in that. In the meantime,\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears\n(As worthy cause I have to fear I am)\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your honour.\n\nOTHELLO.\nFear not my government.\n\nIAGO.\nI once more take my leave.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nThis fellow’s of exceeding honesty,\nAnd knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,\nOf human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\nThough that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\nI’d whistle her off, and let her down the wind\nTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\nThat chamberers have, or for I am declin’d\nInto the vale of years,—yet that’s not much—\nShe’s gone, I am abus’d, and my relief\nMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours,\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,\nAnd live upon the vapour of a dungeon,\nThan keep a corner in the thing I love\nFor others’ uses. Yet, ’tis the plague of great ones,\nPrerogativ’d are they less than the base,\n’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us\nWhen we do quicken. Desdemona comes.\nIf she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!\nI’ll not believe’t.\n\nEnter Desdemona and Emilia.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nHow now, my dear Othello?\nYour dinner, and the generous islanders\nBy you invited, do attend your presence.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI am to blame.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhy do you speak so faintly?\nAre you not well?\n\nOTHELLO.\nI have a pain upon my forehead here.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nFaith, that’s with watching, ’twill away again;\nLet me but bind it hard, within this hour\nIt will be well.\n\nOTHELLO.\nYour napkin is too little;\n\n[He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it.]\n\nLet it alone. Come, I’ll go in with you.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI am very sorry that you are not well.\n\n[Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.]\n\nEMILIA.\nI am glad I have found this napkin;\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor.\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\nWoo’d me to steal it. But she so loves the token,\nFor he conjur’d her she should ever keep it,\nThat she reserves it evermore about her\nTo kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out,\nAnd give’t Iago. What he will do with it\nHeaven knows, not I,\nI nothing but to please his fantasy.\n\nEnter Iago.\n\nIAGO.\nHow now? What do you here alone?\n\nEMILIA.\nDo not you chide. I have a thing for you.\n\nIAGO.\nA thing for me? It is a common thing—\n\nEMILIA.\nHa?\n\nIAGO.\nTo have a foolish wife.\n\nEMILIA.\nO, is that all? What will you give me now\nFor that same handkerchief?\n\nIAGO.\nWhat handkerchief?\n\nEMILIA.\nWhat handkerchief?\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\n\nIAGO.\nHast stol’n it from her?\n\nEMILIA.\nNo, faith, she let it drop by negligence,\nAnd, to the advantage, I being here, took ’t up.\nLook, here it is.\n\nIAGO.\nA good wench, give it me.\n\nEMILIA.\nWhat will you do with’t, that you have been so earnest\nTo have me filch it?\n\nIAGO.\n[Snatching it.] Why, what’s that to you?\n\nEMILIA.\nIf it be not for some purpose of import,\nGive ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad\nWhen she shall lack it.\n\nIAGO.\nBe not acknown on’t, I have use for it.\nGo, leave me.\n\n[Exit Emilia.]\n\nI will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin,\nAnd let him find it. Trifles light as air\nAre to the jealous confirmations strong\nAs proofs of holy writ. This may do something.\nThe Moor already changes with my poison:\nDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste,\nBut with a little act upon the blood\nBurn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.\n\nEnter Othello.\n\nLook, where he comes. Not poppy, nor mandragora,\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\nWhich thou ow’dst yesterday.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHa! ha! false to me?\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, how now, general? No more of that.\n\nOTHELLO.\nAvaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.\nI swear ’tis better to be much abus’d\nThan but to know’t a little.\n\nIAGO.\nHow now, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?\nI saw’t not, thought it not, it harm’d not me.\nI slept the next night well, was free and merry;\nI found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.\nHe that is robb’d, not wanting what is stol’n,\nLet him not know’t, and he’s not robb’d at all.\n\nIAGO.\nI am sorry to hear this.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI had been happy if the general camp,\nPioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\nSo I had nothing known. O, now, for ever\nFarewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!\nFarewell the plumed troops and the big wars\nThat make ambition virtue! O, farewell,\nFarewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\nThe spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\nPride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!\nAnd, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\nThe immortal Jove’s dread clamours counterfeit,\nFarewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!\n\nIAGO.\nIs’t possible, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;\nBe sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,\nOr, by the worth of man’s eternal soul,\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog\nThan answer my wak’d wrath.\n\nIAGO.\nIs’t come to this?\n\nOTHELLO.\nMake me to see’t, or at the least so prove it,\nThat the probation bear no hinge nor loop\nTo hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!\n\nIAGO.\nMy noble lord,—\n\nOTHELLO.\nIf thou dost slander her and torture me,\nNever pray more. Abandon all remorse;\nOn horror’s head horrors accumulate;\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz’d;\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\nGreater than that.\n\nIAGO.\nO grace! O heaven defend me!\nAre you a man? Have you a soul or sense?\nGod be wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool,\nThat liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!\nO monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,\nTo be direct and honest is not safe.\nI thank you for this profit, and from hence\nI’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.\n\nIAGO.\nI should be wise; for honesty’s a fool,\nAnd loses that it works for.\n\nOTHELLO.\nBy the world,\nI think my wife be honest, and think she is not.\nI think that thou art just, and think thou art not.\nI’ll have some proof: her name, that was as fresh\nAs Dian’s visage, is now begrim’d and black\nAs mine own face. If there be cords or knives,\nPoison or fire, or suffocating streams,\nI’ll not endure ’t. Would I were satisfied!\n\nIAGO.\nI see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.\nI do repent me that I put it to you.\nYou would be satisfied?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWould? Nay, I will.\n\nIAGO.\nAnd may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?\nWould you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,\nBehold her topp’d?\n\nOTHELLO.\nDeath and damnation! O!\n\nIAGO.\nIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,\nTo bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,\nIf ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\nMore than their own! What then? How then?\nWhat shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?\nIt is impossible you should see this,\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\nAs salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\nAs ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,\nIf imputation and strong circumstances,\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth,\nWill give you satisfaction, you may have’t.\n\nOTHELLO.\nGive me a living reason she’s disloyal.\n\nIAGO.\nI do not like the office,\nBut sith I am enter’d in this cause so far,\nPrick’d to ’t by foolish honesty and love,\nI will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth,\nI could not sleep.\nThere are a kind of men so loose of soul,\nThat in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.\nOne of this kind is Cassio:\nIn sleep I heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona,\nLet us be wary, let us hide our loves;”\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\nCry “O sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,\nAs if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,\nThat grew upon my lips, then laid his leg\nOver my thigh, and sigh’d and kiss’d, and then\nCried “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!”\n\nOTHELLO.\nO monstrous! monstrous!\n\nIAGO.\nNay, this was but his dream.\n\nOTHELLO.\nBut this denoted a foregone conclusion.\n’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\n\nIAGO.\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI’ll tear her all to pieces.\n\nIAGO.\nNay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done,\nShe may be honest yet. Tell me but this,\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\nSpotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?\n\nOTHELLO.\nI gave her such a one, ’twas my first gift.\n\nIAGO.\nI know not that: but such a handkerchief\n(I am sure it was your wife’s) did I today\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\n\nOTHELLO.\nIf it be that,—\n\nIAGO.\nIf it be that, or any that was hers,\nIt speaks against her with the other proofs.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge!\nNow do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago;\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\n’Tis gone.\nArise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!\nYield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\nTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\nFor ’tis of aspics’ tongues!\n\nIAGO.\nYet be content.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO, blood, Iago, blood!\n\nIAGO.\nPatience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNever, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,\nWhose icy current and compulsive course\nNe’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\nTo the Propontic and the Hellespont;\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\nShall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\nSwallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow [Kneels.]\nI here engage my words.\n\nIAGO.\nDo not rise yet. [Kneels.]\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above,\nYou elements that clip us round about,\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\nThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,\nTo wrong’d Othello’s service! Let him command,\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse,\nWhat bloody business ever.\n\n[They rise.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nI greet thy love,\nNot with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to ’t.\nWithin these three days let me hear thee say\nThat Cassio’s not alive.\n\nIAGO.\nMy friend is dead. ’Tis done at your request.\nBut let her live.\n\nOTHELLO.\nDamn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!\nCome, go with me apart, I will withdraw\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death\nFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\n\nIAGO.\nI am your own for ever.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE IV. Cyprus. Before the Castle.\nEnter Desdemona, Emilia and Clown.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nDo you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?\n\nCLOWN.\nI dare not say he lies anywhere.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhy, man?\n\nCLOWN.\nHe’s a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nGo to. Where lodges he?\n\nCLOWN.\nTo tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nCan anything be made of this?\n\nCLOWN.\nI know not where he lodges; and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nCan you inquire him out, and be edified by report?\n\nCLOWN.\nI will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions and by them answer.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nSeek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.\n\nCLOWN.\nTo do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhere should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\n\nEMILIA.\nI know not, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nBelieve me, I had rather have lost my purse\nFull of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor\nIs true of mind and made of no such baseness\nAs jealous creatures are, it were enough\nTo put him to ill thinking.\n\nEMILIA.\nIs he not jealous?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWho, he? I think the sun where he was born\nDrew all such humours from him.\n\nEMILIA.\nLook, where he comes.\n\nEnter Othello.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI will not leave him now till Cassio\nBe call’d to him. How is’t with you, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWell, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!\nHow do you, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWell, my good lord.\n\nOTHELLO.\nGive me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIt yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.\n\nOTHELLO.\nThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.\nHot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires\nA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,\nMuch castigation, exercise devout;\nFor here’s a young and sweating devil here\nThat commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,\nA frank one.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nYou may indeed say so,\nFor ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.\n\nOTHELLO.\nA liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands,\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat promise, chuck?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.\nLend me thy handkerchief.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nHere, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.\nThat which I gave you.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI have it not about me.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNot?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nNo, faith, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.\nThat is a fault. That handkerchief\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give.\nShe was a charmer, and could almost read\nThe thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,\n’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father\nEntirely to her love. But if she lost it,\nOr made a gift of it, my father’s eye\nShould hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt\nAfter new fancies: she, dying, gave it me,\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wive,\nTo give it her. I did so; and take heed on’t,\nMake it a darling like your precious eye.\nTo lose’t or give’t away were such perdition\nAs nothing else could match.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIs’t possible?\n\nOTHELLO.\n’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.\nA sibyl, that had number’d in the world\nThe sun to course two hundred compasses,\nIn her prophetic fury sew’d the work;\nThe worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk,\nAnd it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful\nConserv’d of maiden’s hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIndeed? Is’t true?\n\nOTHELLO.\nMost veritable, therefore look to ’t well.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nThen would to God that I had never seen ’t!\n\nOTHELLO.\nHa? wherefore?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?\n\nOTHELLO.\nIs’t lost? is’t gone? speak, is it out of the way?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nHeaven bless us!\n\nOTHELLO.\nSay you?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIt is not lost, but what and if it were?\n\nOTHELLO.\nHow?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI say it is not lost.\n\nOTHELLO.\nFetch’t, let me see ’t.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhy, so I can, sir, but I will not now.\nThis is a trick to put me from my suit.\nPray you, let Cassio be receiv’d again.\n\nOTHELLO.\nFetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nCome, come.\nYou’ll never meet a more sufficient man.\n\nOTHELLO.\nThe handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI pray, talk me of Cassio.\n\nOTHELLO.\nThe handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nA man that all his time\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love,\nShar’d dangers with you,—\n\nOTHELLO.\nThe handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIn sooth, you are to blame.\n\nOTHELLO.\nAway!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEMILIA.\nIs not this man jealous?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI ne’er saw this before.\nSure there’s some wonder in this handkerchief,\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\n\nEMILIA.\n’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:\nThey are all but stomachs and we all but food;\nThey eat us hungerly, and when they are full,\nThey belch us.\n\nEnter Cassio and Iago.\n\nLook you, Cassio and my husband.\n\nIAGO.\nThere is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,\nAnd, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nHow now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?\n\nCASSIO.\nMadam, my former suit: I do beseech you\nThat by your virtuous means I may again\nExist, and be a member of his love,\nWhom I, with all the office of my heart,\nEntirely honour. I would not be delay’d.\nIf my offence be of such mortal kind\nThat nor my service past, nor present sorrows,\nNor purpos’d merit in futurity,\nCan ransom me into his love again,\nBut to know so must be my benefit;\nSo shall I clothe me in a forc’d content,\nAnd shut myself up in some other course\nTo fortune’s alms.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAlas, thrice-gentle Cassio,\nMy advocation is not now in tune;\nMy lord is not my lord; nor should I know him\nWere he in favour as in humour alter’d.\nSo help me every spirit sanctified,\nAs I have spoken for you all my best,\nAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure\nFor my free speech! You must awhile be patient.\nWhat I can do I will; and more I will\nThan for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.\n\nIAGO.\nIs my lord angry?\n\nEMILIA.\nHe went hence but now,\nAnd certainly in strange unquietness.\n\nIAGO.\nCan he be angry? I have seen the cannon,\nWhen it hath blown his ranks into the air\nAnd, like the devil, from his very arm\nPuff’d his own brother, and can he be angry?\nSomething of moment then. I will go meet him.\nThere’s matter in’t indeed if he be angry.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI prithee do so.\n\n[Exit Iago.]\n\nSomething sure of state,\nEither from Venice, or some unhatch’d practice\nMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\nHath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases\nMen’s natures wrangle with inferior things,\nThough great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.\nFor let our finger ache, and it indues\nOur other healthful members even to that sense\nOf pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,\nNor of them look for such observancy\nAs fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,\nI was (unhandsome warrior as I am)\nArraigning his unkindness with my soul;\nBut now I find I had suborn’d the witness,\nAnd he’s indicted falsely.\n\nEMILIA.\nPray heaven it be state matters, as you think,\nAnd no conception nor no jealous toy\nConcerning you.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAlas the day, I never gave him cause!\n\nEMILIA.\nBut jealous souls will not be answer’d so;\nThey are not ever jealous for the cause,\nBut jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monster\nBegot upon itself, born on itself.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nHeaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!\n\nEMILIA.\nLady, amen.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:\nIf I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit,\nAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.\n\nCASSIO.\nI humbly thank your ladyship.\n\n[Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.]\n\nEnter Bianca.\n\nBIANCA.\nSave you, friend Cassio!\n\nCASSIO.\nWhat make you from home?\nHow is it with you, my most fair Bianca?\nI’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\n\nBIANCA.\nAnd I was going to your lodging, Cassio.\nWhat, keep a week away? Seven days and nights?\nEight score eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours,\nMore tedious than the dial eight score times?\nO weary reckoning!\n\nCASSIO.\nPardon me, Bianca.\nI have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d,\nBut I shall in a more continuate time\nStrike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,\n\n[Giving her Desdemona’s handkerchief.]\n\nTake me this work out.\n\nBIANCA.\nO Cassio, whence came this?\nThis is some token from a newer friend.\nTo the felt absence now I feel a cause.\nIs’t come to this? Well, well.\n\nCASSIO.\nGo to, woman!\nThrow your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,\nFrom whence you have them. You are jealous now\nThat this is from some mistress, some remembrance.\nNo, in good troth, Bianca.\n\nBIANCA.\nWhy, whose is it?\n\nCASSIO.\nI know not neither. I found it in my chamber.\nI like the work well. Ere it be demanded,\nAs like enough it will, I’d have it copied.\nTake it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.\n\nBIANCA.\nLeave you, wherefore?\n\nCASSIO.\nI do attend here on the general,\nAnd think it no addition, nor my wish,\nTo have him see me woman’d.\n\nBIANCA.\nWhy, I pray you?\n\nCASSIO.\nNot that I love you not.\n\nBIANCA.\nBut that you do not love me.\nI pray you bring me on the way a little,\nAnd say if I shall see you soon at night.\n\nCASSIO.\n’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,\nFor I attend here. But I’ll see you soon.\n\nBIANCA.\n’Tis very good; I must be circumstanc’d.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT IV\nSCENE I. Cyprus. Before the Castle.\nEnter Othello and Iago.\n\nIAGO.\nWill you think so?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThink so, Iago?\n\nIAGO.\nWhat,\nTo kiss in private?\n\nOTHELLO.\nAn unauthoriz’d kiss.\n\nIAGO.\nOr to be naked with her friend in bed\nAn hour or more, not meaning any harm?\n\nOTHELLO.\nNaked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?\nIt is hypocrisy against the devil:\nThey that mean virtuously and yet do so,\nThe devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.\n\nIAGO.\nSo they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.\nBut if I give my wife a handkerchief—\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat then?\n\nIAGO.\nWhy then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,\nShe may, I think, bestow’t on any man.\n\nOTHELLO.\nShe is protectress of her honour too.\nMay she give that?\n\nIAGO.\nHer honour is an essence that’s not seen;\nThey have it very oft that have it not:\nBut for the handkerchief—\n\nOTHELLO.\nBy heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.\nThou said’st (O, it comes o’er my memory,\nAs doth the raven o’er the infected house,\nBoding to all) he had my handkerchief.\n\nIAGO.\nAy, what of that?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThat’s not so good now.\n\nIAGO.\nWhat\nIf I had said I had seen him do you wrong?\nOr heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,\nWho having, by their own importunate suit,\nOr voluntary dotage of some mistress,\nConvinced or supplied them, cannot choose\nBut they must blab.)\n\nOTHELLO.\nHath he said anything?\n\nIAGO.\nHe hath, my lord, but be you well assur’d,\nNo more than he’ll unswear.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat hath he said?\n\nIAGO.\nFaith, that he did—I know not what he did.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat? What?\n\nIAGO.\nLie.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWith her?\n\nIAGO.\nWith her, on her, what you will.\n\nOTHELLO.\nLie with her! lie on her!—We say lie on her when they belie her.—Lie with her! that’s fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is’t possible?—Confess?—handkerchief?—O devil!—\n\n[Falls in a trance.]\n\nIAGO.\nWork on,\nMy medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,\nAnd many worthy and chaste dames even thus,\nAll guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!\nMy lord, I say! Othello!\n\nEnter Cassio.\n\nHow now, Cassio!\n\nCASSIO.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nIAGO.\nMy lord is fallen into an epilepsy.\nThis is his second fit. He had one yesterday.\n\nCASSIO.\nRub him about the temples.\n\nIAGO.\nNo, forbear;\nThe lethargy must have his quiet course.\nIf not, he foams at mouth, and by and by\nBreaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs:\nDo you withdraw yourself a little while,\nHe will recover straight. When he is gone,\nI would on great occasion speak with you.\n\n[Exit Cassio.]\n\nHow is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?\n\nOTHELLO.\nDost thou mock me?\n\nIAGO.\nI mock you? No, by heaven.\nWould you would bear your fortune like a man!\n\nOTHELLO.\nA horned man’s a monster and a beast.\n\nIAGO.\nThere’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,\nAnd many a civil monster.\n\nOTHELLO.\nDid he confess it?\n\nIAGO.\nGood sir, be a man.\nThink every bearded fellow that’s but yok’d\nMay draw with you. There’s millions now alive\nThat nightly lie in those unproper beds\nWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.\nO, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,\nTo lip a wanton in a secure couch,\nAnd to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,\nAnd knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO, thou art wise, ’tis certain.\n\nIAGO.\nStand you awhile apart,\nConfine yourself but in a patient list.\nWhilst you were here o’erwhelmed with your grief,\n(A passion most unsuiting such a man)\nCassio came hither. I shifted him away,\nAnd laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy,\nBade him anon return, and here speak with me,\nThe which he promis’d. Do but encave yourself,\nAnd mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,\nThat dwell in every region of his face;\nFor I will make him tell the tale anew,\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when\nHe hath, and is again to cope your wife:\nI say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,\nOr I shall say you are all in all in spleen,\nAnd nothing of a man.\n\nOTHELLO.\nDost thou hear, Iago?\nI will be found most cunning in my patience;\nBut,—dost thou hear?—most bloody.\n\nIAGO.\nThat’s not amiss.\nBut yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?\n\n[Othello withdraws.]\n\nNow will I question Cassio of Bianca,\nA housewife that by selling her desires\nBuys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature\nThat dotes on Cassio, (as ’tis the strumpet’s plague\nTo beguile many and be beguil’d by one.)\nHe, when he hears of her, cannot refrain\nFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes.\n\nEnter Cassio.\n\nAs he shall smile Othello shall go mad,\nAnd his unbookish jealousy must construe\nPoor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviour\nQuite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO.\nThe worser that you give me the addition\nWhose want even kills me.\n\nIAGO.\nPly Desdemona well, and you are sure on’t.\n[Speaking lower.] Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,\nHow quickly should you speed!\n\nCASSIO.\nAlas, poor caitiff!\n\nOTHELLO.\n[Aside.] Look how he laughs already!\n\nIAGO.\nI never knew a woman love man so.\n\nCASSIO.\nAlas, poor rogue! I think, i’ faith, she loves me.\n\nOTHELLO.\n[Aside.] Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.\n\nIAGO.\nDo you hear, Cassio?\n\nOTHELLO.\nNow he importunes him\nTo tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.\n\nIAGO.\nShe gives it out that you shall marry her.\nDo you intend it?\n\nCASSIO.\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO.\nDo you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?\n\nCASSIO.\nI marry her? What? A customer? I prithee, bear some charity to my wit, do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO.\nSo, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.\n\nIAGO.\nFaith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.\n\nCASSIO.\nPrithee say true.\n\nIAGO.\nI am a very villain else.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHave you scored me? Well.\n\nCASSIO.\nThis is the monkey’s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.\n\nOTHELLO.\nIago beckons me. Now he begins the story.\n\nCASSIO.\nShe was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble, and falls thus about my neck.\n\nOTHELLO.\nCrying, “O dear Cassio!” as it were: his gesture imports it.\n\nCASSIO.\nSo hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO.\nNow he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.\n\nCASSIO.\nWell, I must leave her company.\n\nIAGO.\nBefore me! look where she comes.\n\nEnter Bianca.\n\nCASSIO.\n’Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum’d one.\nWhat do you mean by this haunting of me?\n\nBIANCA.\nLet the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse. Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on’t.\n\nCASSIO.\nHow now, my sweet Bianca? How now, how now?\n\nOTHELLO.\nBy heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\n\nBIANCA.\nIf you’ll come to supper tonight, you may. If you will not, come when you are next prepared for.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nIAGO.\nAfter her, after her.\n\nCASSIO.\nFaith, I must; she’ll rail in the street else.\n\nIAGO.\nWill you sup there?\n\nCASSIO.\nFaith, I intend so.\n\nIAGO.\nWell, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.\n\nCASSIO.\nPrithee come, will you?\n\nIAGO.\nGo to; say no more.\n\n[Exit Cassio.]\n\nOTHELLO.\n[Coming forward.] How shall I murder him, Iago?\n\nIAGO.\nDid you perceive how he laughed at his vice?\n\nOTHELLO.\nO Iago!\n\nIAGO.\nAnd did you see the handkerchief?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWas that mine?\n\nIAGO.\nYours, by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!\n\nIAGO.\nNay, you must forget that.\n\nOTHELLO.\nAy, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature. She might lie by an emperor’s side, and command him tasks.\n\nIAGO.\nNay, that’s not your way.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHang her, I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear! Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!\n\nIAGO.\nShe’s the worse for all this.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO, a thousand, a thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!\n\nIAGO.\nAy, too gentle.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\n\nIAGO.\nIf you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!\n\nIAGO.\nO, ’tis foul in her.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWith mine officer!\n\nIAGO.\nThat’s fouler.\n\nOTHELLO.\nGet me some poison, Iago; this night. I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.\n\nIAGO.\nDo it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.\n\nOTHELLO.\nGood, good. The justice of it pleases. Very good.\n\nIAGO.\nAnd for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by midnight.\n\nOTHELLO.\nExcellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that same?\n\nEnter Lodovico, Desdemona and Attendant.\n\nIAGO.\nSomething from Venice, sure. ’Tis Lodovico\nCome from the duke. See, your wife is with him.\n\nLODOVICO.\nSave you, worthy general!\n\nOTHELLO.\nWith all my heart, sir.\n\nLODOVICO.\nThe duke and senators of Venice greet you.\n\n[Gives him a packet.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nI kiss the instrument of their pleasures.\n\n[Opens the packet and reads.]\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAnd what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?\n\nIAGO.\nI am very glad to see you, signior.\nWelcome to Cyprus.\n\nLODOVICO.\nI thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?\n\nIAGO.\nLives, sir.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nCousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord\nAn unkind breach, but you shall make all well.\n\nOTHELLO.\nAre you sure of that?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nMy lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\n[Reads.] “This fail you not to do, as you will—”\n\nLODOVICO.\nHe did not call; he’s busy in the paper.\nIs there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nA most unhappy one. I would do much\nTo atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.\n\nOTHELLO.\nFire and brimstone!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nMy lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nAre you wise?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhat, is he angry?\n\nLODOVICO.\nMay be the letter mov’d him;\nFor, as I think, they do command him home,\nDeputing Cassio in his government.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nTrust me, I am glad on’t.\n\nOTHELLO.\nIndeed!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nMy lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nI am glad to see you mad.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhy, sweet Othello?\n\nOTHELLO.\nDevil!\n\n[Striking her.]\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI have not deserv’d this.\n\nLODOVICO.\nMy lord, this would not be believ’d in Venice,\nThough I should swear I saw’t: ’tis very much.\nMake her amends. She weeps.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO devil, devil!\nIf that the earth could teem with woman’s tears,\nEach drop she falls would prove a crocodile.\nOut of my sight!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI will not stay to offend you.\n\n[Going.]\n\nLODOVICO.\nTruly, an obedient lady.\nI do beseech your lordship, call her back.\n\nOTHELLO.\nMistress!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nMy lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat would you with her, sir?\n\nLODOVICO.\nWho, I, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO.\nAy, you did wish that I would make her turn.\nSir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,\nAnd turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep;\nAnd she’s obedient, as you say, obedient,\nVery obedient. Proceed you in your tears.\nConcerning this, sir,—O well-painted passion!\nI am commanded home.—Get you away;\nI’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate,\nAnd will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!\n\n[Exit Desdemona.]\n\nCassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,\nI do entreat that we may sup together.\nYou are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nLODOVICO.\nIs this the noble Moor, whom our full senate\nCall all in all sufficient? Is this the nature\nWhom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue\nThe shot of accident nor dart of chance\nCould neither graze nor pierce?\n\nIAGO.\nHe is much chang’d.\n\nLODOVICO.\nAre his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?\n\nIAGO.\nHe’s that he is. I may not breathe my censure\nWhat he might be. If what he might he is not,\nI would to heaven he were!\n\nLODOVICO.\nWhat, strike his wife?\n\nIAGO.\nFaith, that was not so well; yet would I knew\nThat stroke would prove the worst!\n\nLODOVICO.\nIs it his use?\nOr did the letters work upon his blood,\nAnd new-create this fault?\n\nIAGO.\nAlas, alas!\nIt is not honesty in me to speak\nWhat I have seen and known. You shall observe him,\nAnd his own courses will denote him so\nThat I may save my speech: do but go after,\nAnd mark how he continues.\n\nLODOVICO.\nI am sorry that I am deceiv’d in him.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Cyprus. A Room in the Castle.\nEnter Othello and Emilia.\n\nOTHELLO.\nYou have seen nothing, then?\n\nEMILIA.\nNor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.\n\nOTHELLO.\nYes, you have seen Cassio and she together.\n\nEMILIA.\nBut then I saw no harm, and then I heard\nEach syllable that breath made up between them.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat, did they never whisper?\n\nEMILIA.\nNever, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNor send you out o’ the way?\n\nEMILIA.\nNever.\n\nOTHELLO.\nTo fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?\n\nEMILIA.\nNever, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.\nThat’s strange.\n\nEMILIA.\nI durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,\nLay down my soul at stake: if you think other,\nRemove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom.\nIf any wretch have put this in your head,\nLet heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse,\nFor if she be not honest, chaste, and true,\nThere’s no man happy. The purest of their wives\nIs foul as slander.\n\nOTHELLO.\nBid her come hither. Go.\n\n[Exit Emilia.]\n\nShe says enough. Yet she’s a simple bawd\nThat cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,\nA closet lock and key of villainous secrets.\nAnd yet she’ll kneel and pray. I have seen her do ’t.\n\nEnter Desdemona and Emilia.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nMy lord, what is your will?\n\nOTHELLO.\nPray, chuck, come hither.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhat is your pleasure?\n\nOTHELLO.\nLet me see your eyes.\nLook in my face.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWhat horrible fancy’s this?\n\nOTHELLO.\n[To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,\nLeave procreants alone, and shut the door.\nCough, or cry hem, if anybody come.\nYour mystery, your mystery. Nay, dispatch.\n\n[Exit Emilia.]\n\nDESDEMONA.\nUpon my knees, what doth your speech import?\nI understand a fury in your words,\nBut not the words.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhy, what art thou?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nYour wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.\n\nOTHELLO.\nCome, swear it, damn thyself,\nLest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves\nShould fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn’d.\nSwear thou art honest.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nHeaven doth truly know it.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHeaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nTo whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?\n\nOTHELLO.\nO Desdemona, away! away! away!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAlas the heavy day, why do you weep?\nAm I the motive of these tears, my lord?\nIf haply you my father do suspect\nAn instrument of this your calling back,\nLay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,\nWhy, I have lost him too.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHad it pleas’d heaven\nTo try me with affliction, had they rain’d\nAll kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,\nSteep’d me in poverty to the very lips,\nGiven to captivity me and my utmost hopes,\nI should have found in some place of my soul\nA drop of patience. But, alas, to make me\nA fixed figure for the time of scorn\nTo point his slow unmoving finger at.\nYet could I bear that too, well, very well:\nBut there, where I have garner’d up my heart,\nWhere either I must live or bear no life,\nThe fountain from the which my current runs,\nOr else dries up, to be discarded thence,\nOr keep it as a cistern for foul toads\nTo knot and gender in!—turn thy complexion there,\nPatience, thou young and rose-lipp’d cherubin,\nAy, there, look grim as hell!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI hope my noble lord esteems me honest.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,\nThat quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,\nWho art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet,\nThat the sense aches at thee,\nWould thou hadst ne’er been born!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAlas, what ignorant sin have I committed?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWas this fair paper, this most goodly book,\nMade to write “whore” upon? What committed?\nCommitted! O thou public commoner!\nI should make very forges of my cheeks,\nThat would to cinders burn up modesty,\nDid I but speak thy deeds. What committed!\nHeaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;\nThe bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,\nIs hush’d within the hollow mine of earth,\nAnd will not hear it. What committed!\nImpudent strumpet!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nBy heaven, you do me wrong.\n\nOTHELLO.\nAre not you a strumpet?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nNo, as I am a Christian:\nIf to preserve this vessel for my lord\nFrom any other foul unlawful touch\nBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat, not a whore?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nNo, as I shall be sav’d.\n\nOTHELLO.\nIs’t possible?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nO, heaven forgive us!\n\nOTHELLO.\nI cry you mercy then.\nI took you for that cunning whore of Venice\nThat married with Othello.—You, mistress,\n\nEnter Emilia.\n\nThat have the office opposite to Saint Peter,\nAnd keeps the gate of hell. You, you, ay, you!\nWe have done our course; there’s money for your pains.\nI pray you turn the key, and keep our counsel.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEMILIA.\nAlas, what does this gentleman conceive?\nHow do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nFaith, half asleep.\n\nEMILIA.\nGood madam, what’s the matter with my lord?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWith who?\n\nEMILIA.\nWhy, with my lord, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nWho is thy lord?\n\nEMILIA.\nHe that is yours, sweet lady.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia,\nI cannot weep, nor answer have I none\nBut what should go by water. Prithee, tonight\nLay on my bed my wedding sheets, remember,\nAnd call thy husband hither.\n\nEMILIA.\nHere’s a change indeed!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDESDEMONA.\n’Tis meet I should be us’d so, very meet.\nHow have I been behav’d, that he might stick\nThe small’st opinion on my least misuse?\n\nEnter Iago and Emilia.\n\nIAGO.\nWhat is your pleasure, madam? How is’t with you?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes\nDo it with gentle means and easy tasks.\nHe might have chid me so, for, in good faith,\nI am a child to chiding.\n\nIAGO.\nWhat’s the matter, lady?\n\nEMILIA.\nAlas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhor’d her,\nThrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,\nAs true hearts cannot bear.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAm I that name, Iago?\n\nIAGO.\nWhat name, fair lady?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nSuch as she says my lord did say I was.\n\nEMILIA.\nHe call’d her whore: a beggar in his drink\nCould not have laid such terms upon his callet.\n\nIAGO.\nWhy did he so?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI do not know. I am sure I am none such.\n\nIAGO.\nDo not weep, do not weep: alas the day!\n\nEMILIA.\nHath she forsook so many noble matches,\nHer father, and her country, and her friends,\nTo be call’d whore? would it not make one weep?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIt is my wretched fortune.\n\nIAGO.\nBeshrew him for’t!\nHow comes this trick upon him?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nNay, heaven doth know.\n\nEMILIA.\nI will be hang’d, if some eternal villain,\nSome busy and insinuating rogue,\nSome cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,\nHave not devis’d this slander. I’ll be hang’d else.\n\nIAGO.\nFie, there is no such man. It is impossible.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIf any such there be, heaven pardon him!\n\nEMILIA.\nA halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!\nWhy should he call her whore? who keeps her company?\nWhat place? what time? what form? what likelihood?\nThe Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,\nSome base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.\nO heaven, that such companions thou’dst unfold,\nAnd put in every honest hand a whip\nTo lash the rascals naked through the world\nEven from the east to the west!\n\nIAGO.\nSpeak within door.\n\nEMILIA.\nO, fie upon them! Some such squire he was\nThat turn’d your wit the seamy side without,\nAnd made you to suspect me with the Moor.\n\nIAGO.\nYou are a fool. Go to.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAlas, Iago,\nWhat shall I do to win my lord again?\nGood friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,\nI know not how I lost him. Here I kneel.\nIf e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,\nEither in discourse of thought or actual deed,\nOr that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,\nDelighted them in any other form,\nOr that I do not yet, and ever did,\nAnd ever will, (though he do shake me off\nTo beggarly divorcement) love him dearly,\nComfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;\nAnd his unkindness may defeat my life,\nBut never taint my love. I cannot say “whore,”\nIt does abhor me now I speak the word;\nTo do the act that might the addition earn\nNot the world’s mass of vanity could make me.\n\nIAGO.\nI pray you, be content. ’Tis but his humour.\nThe business of the state does him offence,\nAnd he does chide with you.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIf ’twere no other,—\n\nIAGO.\n’Tis but so, I warrant.\n\n[Trumpets within.]\n\nHark, how these instruments summon to supper.\nThe messengers of Venice stay the meat.\nGo in, and weep not. All things shall be well.\n\n[Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.]\n\nEnter Roderigo.\n\nHow now, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO.\nI do not find that thou dealest justly with me.\n\nIAGO.\nWhat in the contrary?\n\nRODERIGO.\nEvery day thou daffest me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.\n\nIAGO.\nWill you hear me, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO.\nFaith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together.\n\nIAGO.\nYou charge me most unjustly.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWith naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist: you have told me she hath received them, and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.\n\nIAGO.\nWell, go to, very well.\n\nRODERIGO.\nVery well, go to, I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well. Nay, I say ’tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.\n\nIAGO.\nVery well.\n\nRODERIGO.\nI tell you ’tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.\n\nIAGO.\nYou have said now.\n\nRODERIGO.\nAy, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.\n\nRODERIGO.\nIt hath not appeared.\n\nIAGO.\nI grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever,—I mean purpose, courage, and valour,—this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.\n\nRODERIGO.\nWell, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?\n\nIAGO.\nSir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.\n\nRODERIGO.\nIs that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.\n\nIAGO.\nO, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\n\nRODERIGO.\nHow do you mean “removing” of him?\n\nIAGO.\nWhy, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.\n\nRODERIGO.\nAnd that you would have me to do?\n\nIAGO.\nAy, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste. About it.\n\nRODERIGO.\nI will hear further reason for this.\n\nIAGO.\nAnd you shall be satisfied.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Therefore, good Emilia,\nGive me my nightly wearing, and adieu.\nWe must not now displease him.\n\nEMILIA.\nI would you had never seen him!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nSo would not I. My love doth so approve him,\nThat even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,—\nPrithee, unpin me,—have grace and favour in them.\n\nEMILIA.\nI have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nAll’s one.

It is a great price\nFor a small vice.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nIn troth, I think thou wouldst not.\n\nEMILIA.\nIn troth, I think I should, and undo’t when I had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole world—why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nBeshrew me, if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.\n\nEMILIA.\nWhy, the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world; and having the world for your labour, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nI do not think there is any such woman.\n\nEMILIA.\nYes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for.\nBut I do think it is their husbands’ faults\nIf wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,\nAnd pour our treasures into foreign laps;\nOr else break out in peevish jealousies,\nThrowing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,\nOr scant our former having in despite.\nWhy, we have galls; and though we have some grace,\nYet have we some revenge. Let husbands know\nTheir wives have sense like them: they see, and smell\nAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\nI think it is. And doth affection breed it?\nI think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs?\nIt is so too. And have not we affections,\nDesires for sport, and frailty, as men have?\nThen let them use us well: else let them know,\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nGood night, good night. Heaven me such usage send,\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!\n\n[Exeunt.]",

What’s best to do?\nIf she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.\nMy wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.\nO, insupportable! O heavy hour!\nMethinks it should be now a huge eclipse\nOf sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe\nShould yawn at alteration.\n\nEMILIA.\n[Within.] I do beseech you\nThat I may speak with you, O, good my lord!\n\nOTHELLO.\nI had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia.\nSoft, by and by; let me the curtains draw.\nWhere art thou?\n\n[Unlocks the door.]\n\nEnter Emilia.\n\nWhat’s the matter with thee now?\n\nEMILIA.\nO, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done!\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat, now?\n\nEMILIA.\nBut now, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.\nIt is the very error of the moon,\nShe comes more nearer earth than she was wont\nAnd makes men mad.\n\nEMILIA.\nCassio, my lord, hath kill’d a young Venetian\nCall’d Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO.\nRoderigo kill’d?\nAnd Cassio kill’d?\n\nEMILIA.\nNo, Cassio is not kill’d.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNot Cassio kill’d! Then murder’s out of tune,\nAnd sweet revenge grows harsh.\n\nDESDEMONA.\nO, falsely, falsely murder’d!\n\nEMILIA.\nAlas, what cry is that?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThat? What?\n\nEMILIA.\nOut, and alas! That was my lady’s voice.\nHelp! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again,\nSweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!\n\nDESDEMONA.\nA guiltless death I die.\n\nEMILIA.\nO, who hath done this deed?\n\nDESDEMONA.\nNobody; I myself. Farewell.\nCommend me to my kind lord. O, farewell!\n\n[She dies.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhy, how should she be murder’d?\n\nEMILIA.\nAlas, who knows?\n\nOTHELLO.\nYou heard her say herself, it was not I.\n\nEMILIA.\nShe said so. I must needs report the truth.\n\nOTHELLO.\nShe’s like a liar, gone to burning hell.\n’Twas I that kill’d her.\n\nEMILIA.\nO, the more angel she,\nAnd you the blacker devil!\n\nOTHELLO.\nShe turn’d to folly, and she was a whore.\n\nEMILIA.\nThou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.\n\nOTHELLO.\nShe was false as water.\n\nEMILIA.\nThou art rash as fire, to say\nThat she was false: O, she was heavenly true!\n\nOTHELLO.\nCassio did top her; ask thy husband else.\nO, I were damn’d beneath all depth in hell,\nBut that I did proceed upon just grounds\nTo this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.\n\nEMILIA.\nMy husband?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThy husband.\n\nEMILIA.\nThat she was false to wedlock?\n\nOTHELLO.\nAy, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,\nIf heaven would make me such another world\nOf one entire and perfect chrysolite,\nI’d not have sold her for it.\n\nEMILIA.\nMy husband?\n\nOTHELLO.\nAy, ’twas he that told me first.\nAn honest man he is, and hates the slime\nThat sticks on filthy deeds.\n\nEMILIA.\nMy husband?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhat needs this iterance, woman? I say thy husband.\n\nEMILIA.\nO mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!\nMy husband say that she was false?\n\nOTHELLO.\nHe, woman;\nI say thy husband: dost understand the word?\nMy friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.\n\nEMILIA.\nIf he say so, may his pernicious soul\nRot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart.\nShe was too fond of her most filthy bargain.\n\nOTHELLO.\nHa!\n\nEMILIA.\nDo thy worst:\nThis deed of thine is no more worthy heaven\nThan thou wast worthy her.\n\nOTHELLO.\nPeace, you were best.\n\nEMILIA.\nThou hast not half that power to do me harm\nAs I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!\nAs ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed\n(I care not for thy sword) I’ll make thee known,\nThough I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!\nThe Moor hath kill’d my mistress! Murder, murder!\n\nEnter Montano, Gratiano and Iago.\n\nMONTANO.\nWhat is the matter? How now, general?\n\nEMILIA.\nO, are you come, Iago? You have done well,\nThat men must lay their murders on your neck.\n\nGRATIANO.\nWhat is the matter?\n\nEMILIA.\nDisprove this villain, if thou be’st a man.\nHe says thou told’st him that his wife was false.\nI know thou didst not, thou’rt not such a villain.\nSpeak, for my heart is full.\n\nIAGO.\nI told him what I thought, and told no more\nThan what he found himself was apt and true.\n\nEMILIA.\nBut did you ever tell him she was false?\n\nIAGO.\nI did.\n\nEMILIA.\nYou told a lie, an odious, damned lie;\nUpon my soul, a lie; a wicked lie.\nShe false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?\n\nIAGO.\nWith Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.\n\nEMILIA.\nI will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.\nMy mistress here lies murder’d in her bed.\n\nALL.\nO heavens forfend!\n\nEMILIA.\nAnd your reports have set the murder on.\n\nOTHELLO.\nNay, stare not, masters, it is true indeed.\n\nGRATIANO.\n’Tis a strange truth.\n\nMONTANO.\nO monstrous act!\n\nEMILIA.\nVillany, villany, villany!\nI think upon’t, I think I smell’t; O villany!\nI thought so then. I’ll kill myself for grief.\nO villany, villany!\n\nIAGO.\nWhat, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.\n\nEMILIA.\nGood gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.\n’Tis proper I obey him, but not now.\nPerchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO! O! O!\n\n[Hanging over his wife.]\n\nEMILIA.\nNay, lay thee down and roar;\nFor thou hast kill’d the sweetest innocent\nThat e’er did lift up eye.\n\nOTHELLO.\n[Rising.] O, she was foul!\nI scarce did know you, uncle, there lies your niece,\nWhose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp’d.\nI know this act shows horrible and grim.\n\nGRATIANO.\nPoor Desdemona! I am glad thy father’s dead.\nThy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\nShore his old thread in twain: did he live now,\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turn,\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\nAnd fall to reprobance.\n\nOTHELLO.\n’Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows\nThat she with Cassio hath the act of shame\nA thousand times committed; Cassio confess’d it,\nAnd she did gratify his amorous works\nWith that recognizance and pledge of love\nWhich I first gave her; I saw it in his hand.\nIt was a handkerchief, an antique token\nMy father gave my mother.\n\nEMILIA.\nO heaven! O heavenly powers!\n\nIAGO.\nCome, hold your peace.\n\nEMILIA.\n’Twill out, ’twill out. I peace?\nNo, I will speak as liberal as the north.\nLet heaven and men and devils, let them all,\nAll, all, cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.\n\nIAGO.\nBe wise, and get you home.\n\nEMILIA.\nI will not.\n\n[Iago offers to stab his wife.]\n\nGRATIANO.\nFie!\nYour sword upon a woman?\n\nEMILIA.\nO thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st of\nI found by fortune and did give my husband;\nFor often with a solemn earnestness,\nMore than indeed belong’d to such a trifle,\nHe begg’d of me to steal it.\n\nIAGO.\nVillanous whore!\n\nEMILIA.\nShe give it Cassio! no, alas, I found it,\nAnd I did give’t my husband.\n\nIAGO.\nFilth, thou liest!\n\nEMILIA.\nBy heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.\nO murderous coxcomb! What should such a fool\nDo with so good a wife?\n\nOTHELLO\nAre there not stones in heaven\nBut what serve for thunder? Precious villain!\n\n[Iago stabs Emilia and then runs out.]\n\nGRATIANO.\nThe woman falls. Sure, he hath kill’d his wife.\n\nEMILIA.\nAy, ay. O, lay me by my mistress’ side.\n\nGRATIANO.\nHe’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.\n\nMONTANO.\n’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,\nWhich I have here recover’d from the Moor.\nCome, guard the door without, let him not pass,\nBut kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,\nFor ’tis a damned slave.\n\n[Exit Montano and Gratiano.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nI am not valiant neither,\nBut every puny whipster gets my sword.\nBut why should honour outlive honesty?\nLet it go all.\n\nEMILIA.\nWhat did thy song bode, lady?\nHark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,\nAnd die in music.\n[Sings.] Willow, willow, willow.\nMoor, she was chaste. She lov’d thee, cruel Moor,\nSo come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;\nSo speaking as I think, I die, I die.\n\n[She dies.]\n\nOTHELLO.\nI have another weapon in this chamber,\nIt is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook’s temper.\nO, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.\n\nGRATIANO.\n[Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;\nThou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.\n\nOTHELLO.\nLook in upon me then, and speak with me,\nOr, naked as I am, I will assault thee.\n\nEnter Gratiano.\n\nGRATIANO.\nWhat is the matter?\n\nOTHELLO.\nBehold, I have a weapon.\nA better never did itself sustain\nUpon a soldier’s thigh: I have seen the day\nThat with this little arm and this good sword\nI have made my way through more impediments\nThan twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!\nWho can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.\nBe not afraid, though you do see me weapon’d.\nHere is my journey’s end, here is my butt,\nAnd very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\nDo you go back dismay’d? ’Tis a lost fear.\nMan but a rush against Othello’s breast,\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\nNow, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr’d wench,\nPale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,\nThis look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,\nAnd fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!\nEven like thy chastity.\nO cursed, cursed slave! Whip me, ye devils,\nFrom the possession of this heavenly sight!\nBlow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur,\nWash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!\nO Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! dead! Oh, oh!\n\nEnter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair, and Officers with Iago prisoner.\n\nLODOVICO.\nWhere is this rash and most unfortunate man?\n\nOTHELLO.\nThat’s he that was Othello. Here I am.\n\nLODOVICO.\nWhere is that viper? Bring the villain forth.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.\nIf that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\n\n[Wounds Iago.]\n\nLODOVICO.\nWrench his sword from him.\n\nIAGO.\nI bleed, sir, but not kill’d.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI am not sorry neither. I’d have thee live,\nFor in my sense ’tis happiness to die.\n\nLODOVICO.\nO thou Othello, that wert once so good,\nFall’n in the practice of a damned slave,\nWhat shall be said to thee?\n\nOTHELLO.\nWhy, anything;\nAn honourable murderer, if you will.\nFor naught did I in hate, but all in honour.\n\nLODOVICO.\nThis wretch hath part confess’d his villany.\nDid you and he consent in Cassio’s death?\n\nOTHELLO.\nAy.\n\nCASSIO.\nDear general, I never gave you cause.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI do believe it, and I ask your pardon.\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\nWhy he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body?\n\nIAGO.\nDemand me nothing. What you know, you know.\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word.\n\nLODOVICO.\nWhat, not to pray?\n\nGRATIANO.\nTorments will ope your lips.\n\nOTHELLO.\nWell, thou dost best.\n\nLODOVICO.\nSir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,\nWhich, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,\nAnd here another. The one of them imports\nThe death of Cassio, to be undertook\nBy Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO villain!\n\nCASSIO.\nMost heathenish and most gross!\n\nLODOVICO.\nNow here’s another discontented paper,\nFound in his pocket too; and this, it seems,\nRoderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,\nBut that, belike, Iago in the interim\nCame in and satisfied him.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO the pernicious caitiff!\nHow came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief\nThat was my wife’s?\n\nCASSIO.\nI found it in my chamber.\nAnd he himself confess’d but even now,\nThat there he dropp’d it for a special purpose\nWhich wrought to his desire.\n\nOTHELLO.\nO fool! fool! fool!\n\nCASSIO.\nThere is besides in Roderigo’s letter,\nHow he upbraids Iago, that he made him\nBrave me upon the watch, whereon it came\nThat I was cast. And even but now he spake,\nAfter long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,\nIago set him on.\n\nLODOVICO.\nYou must forsake this room, and go with us.\nYour power and your command is taken off,\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,\nIf there be any cunning cruelty\nThat can torment him much and hold him long,\nIt shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\nTo the Venetian state. Come, bring away.\n\nOTHELLO.\nSoft you; a word or two before you go.\nI have done the state some service, and they know’t.\nNo more of that. I pray you, in your letters,\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate,\nSpeak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,\nNor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak\nOf one that loved not wisely, but too well;\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought,\nPerplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,\nLike the base Judean, threw a pearl away\nRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdu’d eyes,\nAlbeit unused to the melting mood,\nDrop tears as fast as the Arabian trees\nTheir medicinal gum. Set you down this.\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\nWhere a malignant and a turban’d Turk\nBeat a Venetian and traduc’d the state,\nI took by the throat the circumcised dog,\nAnd smote him, thus.\n\n[Stabs himself.]\n\nLODOVICO.\nO bloody period!\n\nGRATIANO.\nAll that’s spoke is marr’d.\n\nOTHELLO.\nI kiss’d thee ere I kill’d thee. No way but this,\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss.\n\n[Falling upon Desdemona.]\n\nCASSIO.\nThis did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,\nFor he was great of heart.\n\nLODOVICO.\n[To Iago.] O Spartan dog,\nMore fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,\nLook on the tragic loading of this bed.\nThis is thy work. The object poisons sight,\nLet it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\nFor they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain.\nThe time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!\nMyself will straight aboard, and to the state\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
