An apartment in the Duke’s palace.\nEnter Duke, Escalus, Lords and Attendants.\n\nDUKE.\nEscalus.\n\nESCALUS.\nMy lord.\n\nDUKE.\nOf government the properties to unfold\nWould seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse,\nSince I am put to know that your own science\nExceeds, in that, the lists of all advice\nMy strength can give you. Then no more remains\nBut that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,\nAnd let them work. The nature of our people,\nOur city’s institutions, and the terms\nFor common justice, you’re as pregnant in\nAs art and practice hath enriched any\nThat we remember. There is our commission,\nFrom which we would not have you warp.—Call hither,\nI say, bid come before us, Angelo.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nWhat figure of us think you he will bear?\nFor you must know we have with special soul\nElected him our absence to supply;\nLent him our terror, drest him with our love,\nAnd given his deputation all the organs\nOf our own power. What think you of it?\n\nESCALUS.\nIf any in Vienna be of worth\nTo undergo such ample grace and honour,\nIt is Lord Angelo.\n\nEnter Angelo.\n\nDUKE.\nLook where he comes.\n\nANGELO.\nAlways obedient to your Grace’s will,\nI come to know your pleasure.\n\nDUKE.\nAngelo,\nThere is a kind of character in thy life\nThat to th’ observer doth thy history\nFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings\nAre not thine own so proper as to waste\nThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.\nHeaven doth with us as we with torches do,\nNot light them for themselves; for if our virtues\nDid not go forth of us, ’twere all alike\nAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched\nBut to fine issues; nor nature never lends\nThe smallest scruple of her excellence\nBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determines\nHerself the glory of a creditor,\nBoth thanks and use. But I do bend my speech\nTo one that can my part in him advertise.\nHold, therefore, Angelo.\nIn our remove be thou at full ourself.\nMortality and mercy in Vienna\nLive in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,\nThough first in question, is thy secondary.\nTake thy commission.\n\nANGELO.\nNow, good my lord,\nLet there be some more test made of my metal,\nBefore so noble and so great a figure\nBe stamped upon it.\n\nDUKE.\nNo more evasion.\nWe have with a leavened and prepared choice\nProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.\nOur haste from hence is of so quick condition\nThat it prefers itself, and leaves unquestioned\nMatters of needful value. We shall write to you,\nAs time and our concernings shall importune,\nHow it goes with us; and do look to know\nWhat doth befall you here. So, fare you well.\nTo th’ hopeful execution do I leave you\nOf your commissions.\n\nANGELO.\nYet give leave, my lord,\nThat we may bring you something on the way.\n\nDUKE.\nMy haste may not admit it;\nNor need you, on mine honour, have to do\nWith any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,\nSo to enforce or qualify the laws\nAs to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;\nI’ll privily away. I love the people,\nBut do not like to stage me to their eyes.\nThough it do well, I do not relish well\nTheir loud applause and Aves vehement;\nNor do I think the man of safe discretion\nThat does affect it. Once more, fare you well.\n\nANGELO.\nThe heavens give safety to your purposes!\n\nESCALUS.\nLead forth and bring you back in happiness.\n\nDUKE.\nI thank you. Fare you well.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nESCALUS.\nI shall desire you, sir, to give me leave\nTo have free speech with you; and it concerns me\nTo look into the bottom of my place.\nA power I have, but of what strength and nature\nI am not yet instructed.\n\nANGELO.\n’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,\nAnd we may soon our satisfaction have\nTouching that point.\n\nESCALUS.\nI’ll wait upon your honour.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. A street.\nEnter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.\n\nLUCIO.\nIf the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the King.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHeaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary’s!\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nAmen.\n\nLUCIO.\nThou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments, but scraped one out of the table.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\n“Thou shalt not steal”?\n\nLUCIO.\nAy, that he razed.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWhy, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions! They put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nI never heard any soldier dislike it.\n\nLUCIO.\nI believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nNo? A dozen times at least.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWhat? In metre?\n\nLUCIO.\nIn any proportion or in any language.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI think, or in any religion.\n\nLUCIO.\nAy, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWell, there went but a pair of shears between us.\n\nLUCIO.\nI grant, as there may between the lists and the velvet. Thou art the list.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nAnd thou the velvet. Thou art good velvet; thou’rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?\n\nLUCIO.\nI think thou dost, and indeed, with most painful feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI think I have done myself wrong, have I not?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nYes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.\n\nEnter Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.\n\nLUCIO.\nBehold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to—\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nTo what, I pray?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nJudge.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nTo three thousand dolours a year.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nAy, and more.\n\nLUCIO.\nA French crown more.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nThou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou art full of error; I am sound.\n\nLUCIO.\nNay, not, as one would say, healthy, but so sound as things that are hollow. Thy bones are hollow. Impiety has made a feast of thee.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHow now, which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?\n\nBAWD.\nWell, well! There’s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWho’s that, I pray thee?\n\nBAWD.\nMarry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nClaudio to prison? ’Tis not so.\n\nBAWD.\nNay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw him carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his head to be chopped off.\n\nLUCIO.\nBut, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of this?\n\nBAWD.\nI am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.\n\nLUCIO.\nBelieve me, this may be. He promised to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nBesides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nBut most of all agreeing with the proclamation.\n\nLUCIO.\nAway! Let’s go learn the truth of it.\n\n[Exeunt Lucio and Gentlemen.]\n\nBAWD.\nThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.\n\nEnter Pompey.\n\nHow now? What’s the news with you?\n\nPOMPEY.\nYonder man is carried to prison.\n\nBAWD.\nWell, what has he done?\n\nPOMPEY.\nA woman.\n\nBAWD.\nBut what’s his offence?\n\nPOMPEY.\nGroping for trouts in a peculiar river.\n\nBAWD.\nWhat? Is there a maid with child by him?\n\nPOMPEY.\nNo, but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?\n\nBAWD.\nWhat proclamation, man?\n\nPOMPEY.\nAll houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.\n\nBAWD.\nAnd what shall become of those in the city?\n\nPOMPEY.\nThey shall stand for seed. They had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.\n\nBAWD.\nBut shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down?\n\nPOMPEY.\nTo the ground, mistress.\n\nBAWD.\nWhy, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth! What shall become of me?\n\nPOMPEY.\nCome, fear not you. Good counsellors lack no clients. Though you change your place, you need not change your trade. I’ll be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered.\n\nEnter Provost, Claudio, Juliet and Officers.\n\nBAWD.\nWhat’s to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let’s withdraw.\n\nPOMPEY.\nHere comes Signior Claudio, led by the Provost to prison. And there’s Madam Juliet.\n\n[Exeunt Bawd and Pompey.]\n\nCLAUDIO.\nFellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?\nBear me to prison, where I am committed.\n\nPROVOST.\nI do it not in evil disposition,\nBut from Lord Angelo by special charge.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThus can the demi-god Authority\nMake us pay down for our offence by weight.\nThe words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;\nOn whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.\n\nEnter Lucio and two Gentlemen.\n\nLUCIO.\nWhy, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nFrom too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty.\nAs surfeit is the father of much fast,\nSo every scope by the immoderate use\nTurns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,\nLike rats that ravin down their proper bane,\nA thirsty evil; and when we drink, we die.\n\nLUCIO.\nIf I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment. What’s thy offence, Claudio?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWhat but to speak of would offend again.\n\nLUCIO.\nWhat, is’t murder?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNo.\n\nLUCIO.\nLechery?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nCall it so.\n\nPROVOST.\nAway, sir; you must go.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nOne word, good friend.—Lucio, a word with you.\n\nLUCIO.\nA hundred, if they’ll do you any good. Is lechery so looked after?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThus stands it with me: upon a true contract\nI got possession of Julietta’s bed.\nYou know the lady; she is fast my wife,\nSave that we do the denunciation lack\nOf outward order. This we came not to\nOnly for propagation of a dower\nRemaining in the coffer of her friends,\nFrom whom we thought it meet to hide our love\nTill time had made them for us. But it chances\nThe stealth of our most mutual entertainment\nWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.\n\nLUCIO.\nWith child, perhaps?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nUnhappily, even so.\nAnd the new deputy now for the Duke—\nWhether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,\nOr whether that the body public be\nA horse whereon the governor doth ride,\nWho, newly in the seat, that it may know\nHe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;\nWhether the tyranny be in his place,\nOr in his eminence that fills it up,\nI stagger in—but this new governor\nAwakes me all the enrolled penalties\nWhich have, like unscoured armour, hung by th’ wall\nSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,\nAnd none of them been worn; and for a name\nNow puts the drowsy and neglected act\nFreshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.\n\nLUCIO.\nI warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI have done so, but he’s not to be found.\nI prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:\nThis day my sister should the cloister enter,\nAnd there receive her approbation.\nAcquaint her with the danger of my state;\nImplore her, in my voice, that she make friends\nTo the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.\nI have great hope in that. For in her youth\nThere is a prone and speechless dialect\nSuch as moves men; beside, she hath prosperous art\nWhen she will play with reason and discourse,\nAnd well she can persuade.\n\nLUCIO.\nI pray she may, as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I’ll to her.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI thank you, good friend Lucio.\n\nLUCIO.\nWithin two hours.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nCome, officer, away.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Why I desire thee\nTo give me secret harbour hath a purpose\nMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends\nOf burning youth.\n\nFRIAR THOMAS.\nMay your Grace speak of it?\n\nDUKE.\nMy holy sir, none better knows than you\nHow I have ever loved the life removed,\nAnd held in idle price to haunt assemblies\nWhere youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps.\nI have delivered to Lord Angelo,\nA man of stricture and firm abstinence,\nMy absolute power and place here in Vienna,\nAnd he supposes me travelled to Poland;\nFor so I have strewed it in the common ear,\nAnd so it is received. Now, pious sir,\nYou will demand of me why I do this?\n\nFRIAR THOMAS.\nGladly, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nWe have strict statutes and most biting laws,\nThe needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,\nWhich for this fourteen years we have let slip,\nEven like an o’ergrown lion in a cave\nThat goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,\nHaving bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch,\nOnly to stick it in their children’s sight\nFor terror, not to use, in time the rod\nBecomes more mocked than feared: so our decrees,\nDead to infliction, to themselves are dead,\nAnd liberty plucks justice by the nose,\nThe baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart\nGoes all decorum.\n\nFRIAR THOMAS.\nIt rested in your Grace\nTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased;\nAnd it in you more dreadful would have seemed\nThan in Lord Angelo.\n\nDUKE.\nI do fear, too dreadful.\nSith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,\n’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them\nFor what I bid them do; for we bid this be done\nWhen evil deeds have their permissive pass\nAnd not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,\nI have on Angelo imposed the office;\nWho may in th’ ambush of my name strike home,\nAnd yet my nature never in the fight\nTo do in slander. And to behold his sway,\nI will, as ’twere a brother of your order,\nVisit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,\nSupply me with the habit, and instruct me\nHow I may formally in person bear\nLike a true friar. Moe reasons for this action\nAt our more leisure shall I render you;\nOnly, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;\nStands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses\nThat his blood flows or that his appetite\nIs more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,\nIf power change purpose, what our seemers be.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Upon his place,\nAnd with full line of his authority,\nGoverns Lord Angelo; a man whose blood\nIs very snow-broth; one who never feels\nThe wanton stings and motions of the sense;\nBut doth rebate and blunt his natural edge\nWith profits of the mind, study and fast.\nHe, to give fear to use and liberty,\nWhich have for long run by the hideous law\nAs mice by lions, hath picked out an act,\nUnder whose heavy sense your brother’s life\nFalls into forfeit.

And that’s my pith of business\n’Twixt you and your poor brother.\n\nISABELLA.\nDoth he so\nSeek his life?\n\nLUCIO.\nHas censured him already;\nAnd, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant\nFor’s execution.\n\nISABELLA.\nAlas, what poor ability’s in me\nTo do him good?\n\nLUCIO.\nAssay the power you have.\n\nISABELLA.\nMy power? Alas, I doubt.\n\nLUCIO.\nOur doubts are traitors,\nAnd make us lose the good we oft might win\nBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,\nAnd let him learn to know, when maidens sue,\nMen give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,\nAll their petitions are as freely theirs\nAs they themselves would owe them.\n\nISABELLA.\nI’ll see what I can do.\n\nLUCIO.\nBut speedily.\n\nISABELLA.\nI will about it straight;\nNo longer staying but to give the Mother\nNotice of my affair.

Thy wife?\n\nELBOW.\nAy, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest woman—\n\nESCALUS.\nDost thou detest her therefore?\n\nELBOW.\nI say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.\n\nESCALUS.\nHow dost thou know that, constable?\n\nELBOW.\nMarry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a woman cardinally given, might have been accused in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.\n\nESCALUS.\nBy the woman’s means?\n\nELBOW.\nAy, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as she spit in his face, so she defied him.\n\nPOMPEY.\nSir, if it please your honour, this is not so.\n\nELBOW.\nProve it before these varlets here, thou honourable man, prove it.\n\nESCALUS.\n[To Angelo.] Do you hear how he misplaces?\n\nPOMPEY.\nSir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your honour’s reverence, for stewed prunes; sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish of some threepence; your honours have seen such dishes; they are not china dishes, but very good dishes—\n\nESCALUS.\nGo to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir.\n\nPOMPEY.\nNo, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the right. But to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could not give you threepence again—\n\nFROTH.\nNo, indeed.\n\nPOMPEY.\nVery well. You being then, if you be remembered, cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes—\n\nFROTH.\nAy, so I did indeed.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhy, very well. I telling you then, if you be remembered, that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you—\n\nFROTH.\nAll this is true.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhy, very well then—\n\nESCALUS.\nCome, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose. What was done to Elbow’s wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me to what was done to her.\n\nPOMPEY.\nSir, your honour cannot come to that yet.\n\nESCALUS.\nNo, sir, nor I mean it not.\n\nPOMPEY.\nSir, but you shall come to it, by your honour’s leave. And I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas—was’t not at Hallowmas, Master Froth?\n\nFROTH.\nAll-hallond Eve.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhy, very well. I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir—’twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?\n\nFROTH.\nI have so, because it is an open room, and good for winter.\n\nPOMPEY.\nWhy, very well then. I hope here be truths.\n\nANGELO.\nThis will last out a night in Russia\nWhen nights are longest there. I’ll take my leave,\nAnd leave you to the hearing of the cause;\nHoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all.\n\nESCALUS.\nI think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.\n\n[Exit Angelo.]\n\nNow, sir, come on. What was done to Elbow’s wife, once more?\n\nPOMPEY.\nOnce, sir? There was nothing done to her once.\n\nELBOW.\nI beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI beseech your honour, ask me.\n\nESCALUS.\nWell, sir, what did this gentleman to her?\n\nPOMPEY.\nI beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face. Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; ’tis for a good purpose.—Doth your honour mark his face?\n\nESCALUS.\nAy, sir, very well.\n\nPOMPEY.\nNay, I beseech you, mark it well.\n\nESCALUS.\nWell, I do so.\n\nPOMPEY.\nDoth your honour see any harm in his face?\n\nESCALUS.\nWhy, no.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst thing about him. Good, then, if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the constable’s wife any harm? I would know that of your honour.\n\nESCALUS.\nHe’s in the right. Constable. What say you to it?\n\nELBOW.\nFirst, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected woman.\n\nPOMPEY.\nBy this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us all.\n\nELBOW.\nVarlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The time is yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or child.\n\nPOMPEY.\nSir, she was respected with him before he married with her.\n\nESCALUS.\nWhich is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this true?\n\nELBOW.\nO thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married to her? If ever I was respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me the poor Duke’s officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I’ll have mine action of battery on thee.\n\nESCALUS.\nIf he took you a box o’ th’ ear, you might have your action of slander too.\n\nELBOW.\nMarry, I thank your good worship for it. What is’t your worship’s pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?\n\nESCALUS.\nTruly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou know’st what they are.\n\nELBOW.\nMarry, I thank your worship for it.—Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what’s come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou varlet, thou art to continue.\n\nESCALUS.\n[To Froth.] Where were you born, friend?\n\nFROTH.\nHere in Vienna, sir.\n\nESCALUS.\nAre you of fourscore pounds a year?\n\nFROTH.\nYes, an’t please you, sir.\n\nESCALUS.\nSo. [To Pompey.] What trade are you of, sir?\n\nPOMPEY.\nA tapster, a poor widow’s tapster.\n\nESCALUS.\nYour mistress’ name?\n\nPOMPEY.\nMistress Overdone.\n\nESCALUS.\nHath she had any more than one husband?\n\nPOMPEY.\nNine, sir; Overdone by the last.\n\nESCALUS.\nNine?—Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.\n\nFROTH.\nI thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.\n\nESCALUS.\nWell, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell.\n\n[Exit Froth.]\n\nCome you hither to me, Master tapster. What’s your name, Master tapster?\n\nPOMPEY.\nPompey.\n\nESCALUS.\nWhat else?\n\nPOMPEY.\nBum, sir.\n\nESCALUS.\nTroth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not? Come, tell me true, it shall be the better for you.\n\nPOMPEY.\nTruly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.\n\nESCALUS.\nHow would you live, Pompey? By being a bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?\n\nPOMPEY.\nIf the law would allow it, sir.\n\nESCALUS.\nBut the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna.\n\nPOMPEY.\nDoes your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city?\n\nESCALUS.\nNo, Pompey.\n\nPOMPEY.\nTruly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to’t then. If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.\n\nESCALUS.\nThere is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you. It is but heading and hanging.\n\nPOMPEY.\nIf you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together, you’ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads. If this law hold in Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to pass, say Pompey told you so.\n\nESCALUS.\nThank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipped. So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI thank your worship for your good counsel. [Aside.] But I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.\nWhip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;\nThe valiant heart’s not whipped out of his trade.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nESCALUS.\nCome hither to me, Master Elbow. Come hither, Master Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?\n\nELBOW.\nSeven year and a half, sir.\n\nESCALUS.\nI thought, by the readiness in the office, you had continued in it sometime. You say seven years together?\n\nELBOW.\nAnd a half, sir.\n\nESCALUS.\nAlas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you wrong to put you so oft upon’t. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?\n\nELBOW.\nFaith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some piece of money, and go through with all.\n\nESCALUS.\nLook you bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most sufficient of your parish.\n\nELBOW.\nTo your worship’s house, sir?\n\nESCALUS.\nTo my house. Fare you well.\n\n[Exit Elbow.]\n\nWhat’s o’clock, think you?\n\nJUSTICE.\nEleven, sir.\n\nESCALUS.\nI pray you home to dinner with me.\n\nJUSTICE.\nI humbly thank you.\n\nESCALUS.\nIt grieves me for the death of Claudio,\nBut there’s no remedy.\n\nJUSTICE.\nLord Angelo is severe.\n\nESCALUS.\nIt is but needful.\nMercy is not itself that oft looks so;\nPardon is still the nurse of second woe.\nBut yet, Poor Claudio! There’s no remedy.\nCome, sir.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Alas,\nHe hath but as offended in a dream;\nAll sects, all ages, smack of this vice, and he\nTo die for ’t!\n\nEnter Angelo.\n\nANGELO.\nNow, what’s the matter, Provost?\n\nPROVOST.\nIs it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?\n\nANGELO.\nDid not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?\nWhy dost thou ask again?\n\nPROVOST.\nLest I might be too rash.\nUnder your good correction, I have seen\nWhen, after execution, judgement hath\nRepented o’er his doom.\n\nANGELO.\nGo to; let that be mine.\nDo you your office, or give up your place,\nAnd you shall well be spared.\n\nPROVOST.\nI crave your honour’s pardon.\nWhat shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?\nShe’s very near her hour.\n\nANGELO.\nDispose of her\nTo some more fitter place; and that with speed.\n\nEnter Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nHere is the sister of the man condemned\nDesires access to you.\n\nANGELO.\nHath he a sister?\n\nPROVOST.\nAy, my good lord, a very virtuous maid,\nAnd to be shortly of a sisterhood,\nIf not already.\n\nANGELO.\nWell, let her be admitted.\n\n[Exit Servant.]\n\nSee you the fornicatress be removed;\nLet her have needful but not lavish means;\nThere shall be order for it.\n\nEnter Lucio and Isabella.\n\nPROVOST.\n[Offering to retire.] Save your honour!\n\nANGELO.\nStay a little while. [To Isabella.] You are welcome. What’s your will?\n\nISABELLA.\nI am a woeful suitor to your honour,\nPlease but your honour hear me.\n\nANGELO.\nWell, what’s your suit?\n\nISABELLA.\nThere is a vice that most I do abhor,\nAnd most desire should meet the blow of justice;\nFor which I would not plead, but that I must;\nFor which I must not plead, but that I am\nAt war ’twixt will and will not.\n\nANGELO.\nWell, the matter?\n\nISABELLA.\nI have a brother is condemned to die;\nI do beseech you, let it be his fault,\nAnd not my brother.\n\nPROVOST.\nHeaven give thee moving graces.\n\nANGELO.\nCondemn the fault, and not the actor of it?\nWhy, every fault’s condemned ere it be done.\nMine were the very cipher of a function\nTo find the faults whose fine stands in record,\nAnd let go by the actor.\n\nISABELLA.\nO just but severe law!\nI had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!\n\n[Going.]\n\nLUCIO.\n[To Isabella.] Give’t not o’er so. To him again, entreat him,\nKneel down before him, hang upon his gown;\nYou are too cold. If you should need a pin,\nYou could not with more tame a tongue desire it.\nTo him, I say.\n\nISABELLA.\nMust he needs die?\n\nANGELO.\nMaiden, no remedy.\n\nISABELLA.\nYes, I do think that you might pardon him,\nAnd neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.\n\nANGELO.\nI will not do’t.\n\nISABELLA.\nBut can you if you would?\n\nANGELO.\nLook, what I will not, that I cannot do.\n\nISABELLA.\nBut might you do’t, and do the world no wrong,\nIf so your heart were touched with that remorse\nAs mine is to him?\n\nANGELO.\nHe’s sentenced, ’tis too late.\n\nLUCIO.\n[To Isabella.] You are too cold.\n\nISABELLA.\nToo late? Why, no. I that do speak a word\nMay call it back again. Well, believe this:\nNo ceremony that to great ones longs,\nNot the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,\nThe marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe,\nBecome them with one half so good a grace\nAs mercy does.\nIf he had been as you, and you as he,\nYou would have slipped like him, but he like you\nWould not have been so stern.\n\nANGELO.\nPray you be gone.\n\nISABELLA.\nI would to heaven I had your potency,\nAnd you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?\nNo; I would tell what ’twere to be a judge\nAnd what a prisoner.\n\nLUCIO.\n[Aside.] Ay, touch him; there’s the vein.\n\nANGELO.\nYour brother is a forfeit of the law,\nAnd you but waste your words.\n\nISABELLA.\nAlas, alas!\nWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit once,\nAnd He that might the vantage best have took\nFound out the remedy. How would you be\nIf He, which is the top of judgement, should\nBut judge you as you are? O, think on that,\nAnd mercy then will breathe within your lips,\nLike man new made.\n\nANGELO.\nBe you content, fair maid.\nIt is the law, not I, condemns your brother.\nWere he my kinsman, brother, or my son,\nIt should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.\n\nISABELLA.\nTomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him!\nHe’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens\nWe kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven\nWith less respect than we do minister\nTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.\nWho is it that hath died for this offence?\nThere’s many have committed it.\n\nLUCIO.\nAy, well said.\n\nANGELO.\nThe law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.\nThose many had not dared to do that evil\nIf the first that did th’ edict infringe\nHad answered for his deed. Now ’tis awake,\nTakes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,\nLooks in a glass that shows what future evils,\nEither now, or by remissness new conceived,\nAnd so in progress to be hatched and born,\nAre now to have no successive degrees,\nBut, where they live, to end.\n\nISABELLA.\nYet show some pity.\n\nANGELO.\nI show it most of all when I show justice;\nFor then I pity those I do not know,\nWhich a dismissed offence would after gall,\nAnd do him right that, answering one foul wrong,\nLives not to act another. Be satisfied;\nYour brother dies tomorrow; be content.\n\nISABELLA.\nSo you must be the first that gives this sentence,\nAnd he that suffers. O, it is excellent\nTo have a giant’s strength; but it is tyrannous\nTo use it like a giant.\n\nLUCIO.\nThat’s well said.\n\nISABELLA.\nCould great men thunder\nAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne’er be quiet,\nFor every pelting petty officer\nWould use his heaven for thunder.\nNothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,\nThou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\nSplits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,\nThan the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,\nDressed in a little brief authority,\nMost ignorant of what he’s most assured,\nHis glassy essence, like an angry ape\nPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\nAs makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens,\nWould all themselves laugh mortal.\n\nLUCIO.\nO, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;\nHe’s coming. I perceive ’t.\n\nPROVOST.\nPray heaven she win him.\n\nISABELLA.\nWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself.\nGreat men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,\nBut in the less, foul profanation.\n\nLUCIO.\nThou’rt i’ th’ right, girl; more o’ that.\n\nISABELLA.\nThat in the captain’s but a choleric word\nWhich in the soldier is flat blasphemy.\n\nLUCIO.\nArt advised o’ that? More on’t.\n\nANGELO.\nWhy do you put these sayings upon me?\n\nISABELLA.\nBecause authority, though it err like others,\nHath yet a kind of medicine in itself\nThat skins the vice o’ th’ top. Go to your bosom,\nKnock there, and ask your heart what it doth know\nThat’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess\nA natural guiltiness such as is his,\nLet it not sound a thought upon your tongue\nAgainst my brother’s life.\n\nANGELO.\nShe speaks, and ’tis such sense\nThat my sense breeds with it. [Going.]\nFare you well.\n\nISABELLA.\nGentle my lord, turn back.\n\nANGELO.\nI will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.\n\nISABELLA.\nHark how I’ll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.\n\nANGELO.\nHow? Bribe me?\n\nISABELLA.\nAy, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.\n\nLUCIO.\nYou had marred all else.\n\nISABELLA.\nNot with fond shekels of the tested gold,\nOr stones, whose rates are either rich or poor\nAs fancy values them, but with true prayers,\nThat shall be up at heaven and enter there\nEre sunrise, prayers from preserved souls,\nFrom fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate\nTo nothing temporal.\n\nANGELO.\nWell; come to me tomorrow.\n\nLUCIO.\n[Aside to Isabella.] Go to, ’tis well; away.\n\nISABELLA.\nHeaven keep your honour safe.\n\nANGELO.\n[Aside.] Amen.\nFor I am that way going to temptation,\nWhere prayers cross.\n\nISABELLA.\nAt what hour tomorrow\nShall I attend your lordship?\n\nANGELO.\nAt any time ’fore noon.\n\nISABELLA.\nSave your honour.\n\n[Exeunt Isabella, Lucio and Provost.]\n\nANGELO.\nFrom thee, even from thy virtue!\nWhat’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault or mine?\nThe tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha?\nNot she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I\nThat, lying by the violet in the sun,\nDo as the carrion does, not as the flower,\nCorrupt with virtuous season. Can it be\nThat modesty may more betray our sense\nThan woman’s lightness? Having waste ground enough,\nShall we desire to raze the sanctuary\nAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!\nWhat dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?\nDost thou desire her foully for those things\nThat make her good? O, let her brother live.\nThieves for their robbery have authority\nWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,\nThat I desire to hear her speak again\nAnd feast upon her eyes? What is’t I dream on?\nO cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,\nWith saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous\nIs that temptation that doth goad us on\nTo sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet\nWith all her double vigour, art, and nature,\nOnce stir my temper, but this virtuous maid\nSubdues me quite. Ever till now\nWhen men were fond, I smiled and wondered how.\n\n[Exit.]",

The state whereon I studied\nIs, like a good thing being often read,\nGrown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,\nWherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,\nCould I with boot change for an idle plume\nWhich the air beats for vain. O place, O form,\nHow often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,\nWrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls\nTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.\nLet’s write good angel on the devil’s horn.\n’Tis not the devil’s crest.\n\n[Knock within.]\n\nHow now, who’s there?\n\nEnter Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nOne Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.\n\nANGELO.\nTeach her the way.\n\n[Exit Servant.]\n\nO heavens,\nWhy does my blood thus muster to my heart,\nMaking both it unable for itself\nAnd dispossessing all my other parts\nOf necessary fitness?\nSo play the foolish throngs with one that swoons,\nCome all to help him, and so stop the air\nBy which he should revive.

Then I shall pose you quickly.\nWhich had you rather, that the most just law\nNow took your brother’s life; or, to redeem him,\nGive up your body to such sweet uncleanness\nAs she that he hath stained?\n\nISABELLA.\nSir, believe this:\nI had rather give my body than my soul.\n\nANGELO.\nI talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins\nStand more for number than for accompt.\n\nISABELLA.\nHow say you?\n\nANGELO.\nNay, I’ll not warrant that, for I can speak\nAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:\nI, now the voice of the recorded law,\nPronounce a sentence on your brother’s life.\nMight there not be a charity in sin\nTo save this brother’s life?\n\nISABELLA.\nPlease you to do’t,\nI’ll take it as a peril to my soul;\nIt is no sin at all, but charity.\n\nANGELO.\nPleased you to do’t at peril of your soul,\nWere equal poise of sin and charity.\n\nISABELLA.\nThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,\nHeaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,\nIf that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer\nTo have it added to the faults of mine,\nAnd nothing of your answer.\n\nANGELO.\nNay, but hear me.\nYour sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant,\nOr seem so, crafty; and that’s not good.\n\nISABELLA.\nLet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,\nBut graciously to know I am no better.\n\nANGELO.\nThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright\nWhen it doth tax itself, as these black masks\nProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder\nThan beauty could, displayed. But mark me;\nTo be received plain, I’ll speak more gross.\nYour brother is to die.\n\nISABELLA.\nSo.\n\nANGELO.\nAnd his offence is so, as it appears,\nAccountant to the law upon that pain.\n\nISABELLA.\nTrue.\n\nANGELO.\nAdmit no other way to save his life—\nAs I subscribe not that, nor any other,\nBut, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,\nFinding yourself desired of such a person\nWhose credit with the judge, or own great place,\nCould fetch your brother from the manacles\nOf the all-binding law; and that there were\nNo earthly mean to save him but that either\nYou must lay down the treasures of your body\nTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer,\nWhat would you do?\n\nISABELLA.\nAs much for my poor brother as myself.\nThat is, were I under the terms of death,\nTh’ impression of keen whips I’d wear as rubies,\nAnd strip myself to death as to a bed\nThat longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield\nMy body up to shame.\n\nANGELO.\nThen must your brother die.\n\nISABELLA.\nAnd ’twere the cheaper way.\nBetter it were a brother died at once\nThan that a sister, by redeeming him,\nShould die for ever.\n\nANGELO.\nWere not you then as cruel as the sentence\nThat you have slandered so?\n\nISABELLA.\nIgnominy in ransom and free pardon\nAre of two houses. Lawful mercy\nIs nothing kin to foul redemption.\n\nANGELO.\nYou seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,\nAnd rather proved the sliding of your brother\nA merriment than a vice.\n\nISABELLA.\nO, pardon me, my lord. It oft falls out,\nTo have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.\nI something do excuse the thing I hate\nFor his advantage that I dearly love.\n\nANGELO.\nWe are all frail.\n\nISABELLA.\nElse let my brother die,\nIf not a feodary but only he\nOwe and succeed by weakness.\n\nANGELO.\nNay, women are frail too.\n\nISABELLA.\nAy, as the glasses where they view themselves,\nWhich are as easy broke as they make forms.\nWomen?—Help, heaven! Men their creation mar\nIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;\nFor we are soft as our complexions are,\nAnd credulous to false prints.\n\nANGELO.\nI think it well.\nAnd from this testimony of your own sex,\nSince I suppose we are made to be no stronger\nThan faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.\nI do arrest your words. Be that you are,\nThat is, a woman. If you be more, you’re none.\nIf you be one, as you are well expressed\nBy all external warrants, show it now\nBy putting on the destined livery.\n\nISABELLA.\nI have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord,\nLet me intreat you speak the former language.\n\nANGELO.\nPlainly conceive, I love you.\n\nISABELLA.\nMy brother did love Juliet,\nAnd you tell me that he shall die for ’t.\n\nANGELO.\nHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.\n\nISABELLA.\nI know your virtue hath a license in’t,\nWhich seems a little fouler than it is,\nTo pluck on others.\n\nANGELO.\nBelieve me, on mine honour,\nMy words express my purpose.\n\nISABELLA.\nHa! Little honour to be much believed,\nAnd most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!\nI will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for’t.\nSign me a present pardon for my brother\nOr with an outstretched throat I’ll tell the world aloud\nWhat man thou art.\n\nANGELO.\nWho will believe thee, Isabel?\nMy unsoiled name, th’ austereness of my life,\nMy vouch against you, and my place i’ th’ state\nWill so your accusation overweigh\nThat you shall stifle in your own report,\nAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,\nAnd now I give my sensual race the rein.\nFit thy consent to my sharp appetite;\nLay by all nicety and prolixious blushes\nThat banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother\nBy yielding up thy body to my will;\nOr else he must not only die the death,\nBut thy unkindness shall his death draw out\nTo ling’ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow,\nOr, by the affection that now guides me most,\nI’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,\nSay what you can, my false o’erweighs your true.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nISABELLA.\nTo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,\nWho would believe me? O perilous mouths,\nThat bear in them one and the self-same tongue\nEither of condemnation or approof,\nBidding the law make curtsy to their will,\nHooking both right and wrong to th’ appetite,\nTo follow as it draws! I’ll to my brother.\nThough he hath fall’n by prompture of the blood,\nYet hath he in him such a mind of honour\nThat, had he twenty heads to tender down\nOn twenty bloody blocks, he’d yield them up\nBefore his sister should her body stoop\nTo such abhorred pollution.\nThen, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die.\nMore than our brother is our chastity.\nI’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,\nAnd fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"ACT III\nSCENE I. A room in the prison.\nEnter Duke, Claudio and Provost.\n\nDUKE.\nSo then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThe miserable have no other medicine\nBut only hope.\nI have hope to live, and am prepared to die.\n\nDUKE.\nBe absolute for death. Either death or life\nShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:\nIf I do lose thee, I do lose a thing\nThat none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,\nServile to all the skyey influences\nThat dost this habitation where thou keep’st\nHourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool;\nFor him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun,\nAnd yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble;\nFor all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st\nAre nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant;\nFor thou dost fear the soft and tender fork\nOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,\nAnd that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st\nThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;\nFor thou exists on many a thousand grains\nThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;\nFor what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,\nAnd what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain;\nFor thy complexion shifts to strange effects\nAfter the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor;\nFor, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,\nThou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,\nAnd death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;\nFor thine own bowels which do call thee sire,\nThe mere effusion of thy proper loins,\nDo curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum\nFor ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,\nBut as it were an after-dinner’s sleep\nDreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth\nBecomes as aged, and doth beg the alms\nOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,\nThou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty\nTo make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this\nThat bears the name of life? Yet in this life\nLie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,\nThat makes these odds all even.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI humbly thank you.\nTo sue to live, I find I seek to die,\nAnd seeking death, find life. Let it come on.\n\nISABELLA.\n[Within.] What ho! Peace here; grace and good company!\n\nPROVOST.\nWho’s there? Come in. The wish deserves a welcome.\n\nDUKE.\nDear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nMost holy sir, I thank you.\n\nEnter Isabella.\n\nISABELLA.\nMy business is a word or two with Claudio.\n\nPROVOST.\nAnd very welcome. Look, signior, here’s your sister.\n\nDUKE.\nProvost, a word with you.\n\nPROVOST.\nAs many as you please.\n\nDUKE.\nBring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.\n\n[Exeunt Duke and Provost.]\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNow, sister, what’s the comfort?\n\nISABELLA.\nWhy,\nAs all comforts are, most good, most good indeed.\nLord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,\nIntends you for his swift ambassador,\nWhere you shall be an everlasting leiger.\nTherefore your best appointment make with speed;\nTomorrow you set on.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIs there no remedy?\n\nISABELLA.\nNone, but such remedy as, to save a head,\nTo cleave a heart in twain.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nBut is there any?\n\nISABELLA.\nYes, brother, you may live.\nThere is a devilish mercy in the judge,\nIf you’ll implore it, that will free your life,\nBut fetter you till death.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nPerpetual durance?\n\nISABELLA.\nAy, just; perpetual durance; a restraint,\nThough all the world’s vastidity you had,\nTo a determined scope.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nBut in what nature?\n\nISABELLA.\nIn such a one as, you consenting to’t,\nWould bark your honour from that trunk you bear,\nAnd leave you naked.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nLet me know the point.\n\nISABELLA.\nO, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake,\nLest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,\nAnd six or seven winters more respect\nThan a perpetual honour. Dar’st thou die?\nThe sense of death is most in apprehension;\nAnd the poor beetle that we tread upon\nIn corporal sufferance finds a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWhy give you me this shame?\nThink you I can a resolution fetch\nFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,\nI will encounter darkness as a bride\nAnd hug it in mine arms.\n\nISABELLA.\nThere spake my brother! There my father’s grave\nDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.\nThou art too noble to conserve a life\nIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,\nWhose settled visage and deliberate word\nNips youth i’ th’ head, and follies doth enew\nAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil.\nHis filth within being cast, he would appear\nA pond as deep as hell.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThe precise Angelo?\n\nISABELLA.\nO, ’tis the cunning livery of hell\nThe damned’st body to invest and cover\nIn precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,\nIf I would yield him my virginity\nThou mightst be freed?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO heavens, it cannot be.\n\nISABELLA.\nYes, he would give it thee, from this rank offence,\nSo to offend him still. This night’s the time\nThat I should do what I abhor to name,\nOr else thou diest tomorrow.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThou shalt not do’t.\n\nISABELLA.\nO, were it but my life,\nI’d throw it down for your deliverance\nAs frankly as a pin.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThanks, dear Isabel.\n\nISABELLA.\nBe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYes. Has he affections in him\nThat thus can make him bite the law by th’ nose\nWhen he would force it? Sure it is no sin;\nOr of the deadly seven it is the least.\n\nISABELLA.\nWhich is the least?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf it were damnable, he being so wise,\nWhy would he for the momentary trick\nBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!\n\nISABELLA.\nWhat says my brother?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nDeath is a fearful thing.\n\nISABELLA.\nAnd shamed life a hateful.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAy, but to die, and go we know not where;\nTo lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;\nThis sensible warm motion to become\nA kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\nTo bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\nIn thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;\nTo be imprisoned in the viewless winds\nAnd blown with restless violence round about\nThe pendent world; or to be worse than worst\nOf those that lawless and incertain thought\nImagine howling—’tis too horrible.\nThe weariest and most loathed worldly life\nThat age, ache, penury, and imprisonment\nCan lay on nature is a paradise\nTo what we fear of death.\n\nISABELLA.\nAlas, alas!\n\nCLAUDIO.\nSweet sister, let me live.\nWhat sin you do to save a brother’s life,\nNature dispenses with the deed so far\nThat it becomes a virtue.\n\nISABELLA.\nO, you beast!\nO faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!\nWilt thou be made a man out of my vice?\nIs’t not a kind of incest to take life\nFrom thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?\nHeaven shield my mother played my father fair,\nFor such a warped slip of wilderness\nNe’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance,\nDie, perish! Might but my bending down\nReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.\nI’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,\nNo word to save thee.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNay, hear me, Isabel.\n\nISABELLA.\nO fie, fie, fie!\nThy sin’s not accidental, but a trade.\nMercy to thee would prove itself a bawd.\n’Tis best that thou diest quickly.\n\n[Going.]\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO, hear me, Isabella.\n\nEnter Duke as a Friar.\n\nDUKE.\nVouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.\n\nISABELLA.\nWhat is your will?\n\nDUKE.\nMight you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have some speech with you. The satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefit.\n\nISABELLA.\nI have no superfluous leisure, my stay must be stolen out of other affairs, but I will attend you a while.\n\nDUKE.\n[To Claudio aside.] Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practise his judgement with the disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her, hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible. Tomorrow you must die; go to your knees and make ready.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nLet me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.\n\nDUKE.\nHold you there. Farewell.\n\n[Exit Claudio.]\n\nEnter Provost.\n\nProvost, a word with you.\n\nPROVOST.\nWhat’s your will, father?\n\nDUKE.\nThat, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company.\n\nPROVOST.\nIn good time.\n\n[Exit Provost.]\n\nDUKE.\nThe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good. The goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?\n\nISABELLA.\nI am now going to resolve him. I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good Duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government.\n\nDUKE.\nThat shall not be much amiss. Yet, as the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings, to the love I have in doing good, a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business.\n\nISABELLA.\nLet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\n\nDUKE.\nVirtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at sea?\n\nISABELLA.\nI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\n\nDUKE.\nShe should this Angelo have married, was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed. Between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.\n\nISABELLA.\nCan this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?\n\nDUKE.\nLeft her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour; in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but relents not.\n\nISABELLA.\nWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world! What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?\n\nDUKE.\nIt is a rupture that you may easily heal, and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.\n\nISABELLA.\nShow me how, good father.\n\nDUKE.\nThis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection. His unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to the point. Only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. This being granted in course, and now follows all. We shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?\n\nISABELLA.\nThe image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.\n\nDUKE.\nIt lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke’s; there at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana. At that place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be quickly.\n\nISABELLA.\nI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.\n\n[Exit Isabella.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. The street before the prison.\nEnter Elbow, Pompey and Officers.\n\nELBOW.\nNay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.\n\nDUKE.\nO heavens, what stuff is here?\n\nPOMPEY.\n’Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and furred with fox on lambskins too, to signify that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.\n\nELBOW.\nCome your way, sir.—Bless you, good father friar.\n\nDUKE.\nAnd you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made you, sir?\n\nELBOW.\nMarry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.\n\nDUKE.\nFie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd;\nThe evil that thou causest to be done,\nThat is thy means to live. Do thou but think\nWhat ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back\nFrom such a filthy vice. Say to thyself,\nFrom their abominable and beastly touches\nI drink, I eat, array myself, and live.\nCanst thou believe thy living is a life,\nSo stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.\n\nPOMPEY.\nIndeed, it does stink in some sort, sir. But yet, sir, I would prove—\n\nDUKE.\nNay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,\nThou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer.\nCorrection and instruction must both work\nEre this rude beast will profit.\n\nELBOW.\nHe must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning. The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster. If he be a whoremonger and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.\n\nDUKE.\nThat we were all, as some would seem to be,\nFree from our faults, as faults from seeming, free!\n\nELBOW.\nHis neck will come to your waist—a cord, sir.\n\nEnter Lucio.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI spy comfort, I cry bail! Here’s a gentleman, and a friend of mine.\n\nLUCIO.\nHow now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion’s images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutched? What reply, ha? What say’st thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is’t not drowned i’ th’ last rain, ha? What say’st thou, trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad and few words? Or how? The trick of it?\n\nDUKE.\nStill thus, and thus; still worse!\n\nLUCIO.\nHow doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still, ha?\n\nPOMPEY.\nTroth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub.\n\nLUCIO.\nWhy, ’tis good. It is the right of it. It must be so. Ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd; an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?\n\nPOMPEY.\nYes, faith, sir.\n\nLUCIO.\nWhy, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go, say I sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? Or how?\n\nELBOW.\nFor being a bawd, for being a bawd.\n\nLUCIO.\nWell, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a bawd, why, ’tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of antiquity, too. Bawd born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you will keep the house.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.\n\nLUCIO.\nNo, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.—Bless you, friar.\n\nDUKE.\nAnd you.\n\nLUCIO.\nDoes Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?\n\nELBOW.\nCome your ways, sir, come.\n\nPOMPEY.\nYou will not bail me then, sir?\n\nLUCIO.\nThen, Pompey, nor now.—What news abroad, friar? What news?\n\nELBOW.\nCome your ways, sir, come.\n\nLUCIO.\nGo to kennel, Pompey, go.\n\n[Exeunt Elbow, Pompey and Officers.]\n\nWhat news, friar, of the Duke?\n\nDUKE.\nI know none. Can you tell me of any?\n\nLUCIO.\nSome say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome. But where is he, think you?\n\nDUKE.\nI know not where, but wheresoever, I wish him well.\n\nLUCIO.\nIt was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence. He puts transgression to’t.\n\nDUKE.\nHe does well in’t.\n\nLUCIO.\nA little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.\n\nDUKE.\nIt is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.\n\nLUCIO.\nYes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?\n\nDUKE.\nHow should he be made, then?\n\nLUCIO.\nSome report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he was begot between two stockfishes. But it is certain that when he makes water, his urine is congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a motion ungenerative; that’s infallible.\n\nDUKE.\nYou are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.\n\nLUCIO.\nWhy, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.\n\nDUKE.\nI never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was not inclined that way.\n\nLUCIO.\nO, sir, you are deceived.\n\nDUKE.\n’Tis not possible.\n\nLUCIO.\nWho, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too, that let me inform you.\n\nDUKE.\nYou do him wrong, surely.\n\nLUCIO.\nSir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat, I prithee, might be the cause?\n\nLUCIO.\nNo, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise.\n\nDUKE.\nWise? Why, no question but he was.\n\nLUCIO.\nA very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.\n\nDUKE.\nEither this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking. The very stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully. Or, if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice.\n\nLUCIO.\nSir, I know him, and I love him.\n\nDUKE.\nLove talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.\n\nLUCIO.\nCome, sir, I know what I know.\n\nDUKE.\nI can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you, and I pray you your name?\n\nLUCIO.\nSir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.\n\nDUKE.\nHe shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.\n\nLUCIO.\nI fear you not.\n\nDUKE.\nO, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed, I can do you little harm. You’ll forswear this again.\n\nLUCIO.\nI’ll be hanged first! Thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no?\n\nDUKE.\nWhy should he die, sir?\n\nLUCIO.\nWhy? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke we talk of were returned again. This ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency. Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered. He would never bring them to light. Would he were returned! Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. Farewell, good friar, I prithee pray for me. The Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He’s now past it; yet, and, I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDUKE.\nNo might nor greatness in mortality\nCan censure ’scape. Back-wounding calumny\nThe whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong\nCan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?\nBut who comes here?\n\nEnter Escalus, Provost and Officers with Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.\n\nESCALUS.\nGo, away with her to prison.\n\nBAWD.\nGood my lord, be good to me. Your honour is accounted a merciful man, good my lord.\n\nESCALUS.\nDouble and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind? This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.\n\nPROVOST.\nA bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it please your honour.\n\nBAWD.\nMy lord, this is one Lucio’s information against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke’s time; he promised her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob. I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me.\n\nESCALUS.\nThat fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be called before us. Away with her to prison. Go to, no more words.\n\n[Exeunt Officers with Bawd.]\n\nProvost, my brother Angelo will not be altered; Claudio must die tomorrow. Let him be furnished with divines, and have all charitable preparation. If my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.\n\nPROVOST.\nSo please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him for th’ entertainment of death.\n\nESCALUS.\nGood even, good father.\n\nDUKE.\nBliss and goodness on you!\n\nESCALUS.\nOf whence are you?\n\nDUKE.\nNot of this country, though my chance is now\nTo use it for my time. I am a brother\nOf gracious order, late come from the See\nIn special business from his Holiness.\n\nESCALUS.\nWhat news abroad i’ th’ world?\n\nDUKE.\nNone, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request, and as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?\n\nESCALUS.\nOne that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat pleasure was he given to?\n\nESCALUS.\nRather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at anything which professed to make him rejoice. A gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared. I am made to understand that you have lent him visitation.\n\nDUKE.\nHe professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolved to die.\n\nESCALUS.\nYou have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice.\n\nDUKE.\nIf his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.\n\nESCALUS.\nI am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.\n\nDUKE.\nPeace be with you.\n\n[Exeunt Escalus and Provost.]\n\nHe who the sword of heaven will bear\nShould be as holy as severe,\nPattern in himself to know,\nGrace to stand, and virtue go;\nMore nor less to others paying\nThan by self-offences weighing.\nShame to him whose cruel striking\nKills for faults of his own liking!\nTwice treble shame on Angelo,\nTo weed my vice, and let his grow!\nO, what may man within him hide,\nThough angel on the outward side!\nHow may likeness, made in crimes,\nMake practice on the times,\nTo draw with idle spiders’ strings\nMost ponderous and substantial things!\nCraft against vice I must apply.\nWith Angelo tonight shall lie\nHis old betrothed but despised.\nSo disguise shall, by th’ disguised,\nPay with falsehood false exacting,\nAnd perform an old contracting.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. A room in the prison.\nEnter Provost and Pompey.\n\nPROVOST.\nCome hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man’s head?\n\nPOMPEY.\nIf the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a married man, he’s his wife’s head, and I can never cut off a woman’s head.\n\nPROVOST.\nCome, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a direct answer. Tomorrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a helper; if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have your full time of imprisonment, and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping; for you have been a notorious bawd.\n\nPOMPEY.\nSir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind, but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow-partner.\n\nPROVOST.\nWhat ho, Abhorson! Where’s Abhorson, there?\n\nEnter Abhorson.\n\nABHORSON.\nDo you call, sir?\n\nPROVOST.\nSirrah, here’s a fellow will help you tomorrow in your execution. If you think it meet, compound with him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if not, use him for the present, and dismiss him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.\n\nABHORSON.\nA bawd, sir? Fie upon him, he will discredit our mystery.\n\nPROVOST.\nGo to, sir; you weigh equally. A feather will turn the scale.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPOMPEY.\nPray, sir, by your good favour—for surely, sir, a good favour you have, but that you have a hanging look—do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?\n\nABHORSON.\nAy, sir, a mystery.\n\nPOMPEY.\nPainting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery. But what mystery there should be in hanging, if I should be hanged, I cannot imagine.\n\nABHORSON.\nSir, it is a mystery.\n\nPOMPEY.\nProof.\n\nABHORSON.\nEvery true man’s apparel fits your thief. If it be too little for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it little enough. So every true man’s apparel fits your thief.\n\nEnter Provost.\n\nPROVOST.\nAre you agreed?\n\nPOMPEY.\nSir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd. He doth oftener ask forgiveness.\n\nPROVOST.\nYou, sirrah, provide your block and your axe tomorrow four o’clock.\n\nABHORSON.\nCome on, bawd. I will instruct thee in my trade. Follow.\n\nPOMPEY.\nI do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find me yare. For truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you a good turn.\n\nPROVOST.\nCall hither Barnardine and Claudio.\n\n[Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey.]\n\nTh’ one has my pity; not a jot the other,\nBeing a murderer, though he were my brother.\n\nEnter Claudio.\n\nLook, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death.\n’Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow\nThou must be made immortal. Where’s Barnardine?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAs fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labour\nWhen it lies starkly in the traveller’s bones.\nHe will not wake.\n\nPROVOST.\nWho can do good on him?\nWell, go, prepare yourself. [Knocking within.] But hark, what noise?\nHeaven give your spirits comfort!\n\n[Exit Claudio. Knock within.]\n\nBy and by!—\nI hope it is some pardon or reprieve\nFor the most gentle Claudio.\n\nEnter Duke.\n\nWelcome, father.\n\nDUKE.\nThe best and wholesom’st spirits of the night\nEnvelop you, good Provost! Who called here of late?\n\nPROVOST.\nNone, since the curfew rung.\n\nDUKE.\nNot Isabel?\n\nPROVOST.\nNo.\n\nDUKE.\nThey will then, ere’t be long.\n\nPROVOST.\nWhat comfort is for Claudio?\n\nDUKE.\nThere’s some in hope.\n\nPROVOST.\nIt is a bitter deputy.\n\nDUKE.\nNot so, not so. His life is paralleled\nEven with the stroke and line of his great justice.\nHe doth with holy abstinence subdue\nThat in himself which he spurs on his power\nTo qualify in others. Were he mealed with that\nWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;\nBut this being so, he’s just.\n\n[Knocking within. Provost goes to the door.]\n\nNow are they come.\nThis is a gentle provost. Seldom when\nThe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.\n\n[Knocking within.]\n\nHow now? What noise? That spirit’s possessed with haste\nThat wounds th’ unsisting postern with these strokes.\n\nProvost returns.\n\nPROVOST.\nThere he must stay until the officer\nArise to let him in. He is called up.\n\nDUKE.\nHave you no countermand for Claudio yet,\nBut he must die tomorrow?\n\nPROVOST.\nNone, sir, none.\n\nDUKE.\nAs near the dawning, Provost, as it is,\nYou shall hear more ere morning.\n\nPROVOST.\nHappily\nYou something know, yet I believe there comes\nNo countermand. No such example have we.\nBesides, upon the very siege of justice\nLord Angelo hath to the public ear\nProfessed the contrary.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nThis is his Lordship’s man.\n\nDUKE.\nAnd here comes Claudio’s pardon.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMy lord hath sent you this note, and by me this further charge: that you swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is almost day.\n\nPROVOST.\nI shall obey him.\n\n[Exit Messenger.]\n\nDUKE.\n[Aside.] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin\nFor which the pardoner himself is in.\nHence hath offence his quick celerity,\nWhen it is borne in high authority.\nWhen vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended\nThat for the fault’s love is th’ offender friended.\nNow, sir, what news?\n\nPROVOST.\nI told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.\n\nDUKE.\nPray you, let’s hear.\n\nPROVOST.\n[Reads.] Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and in the afternoon, Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.\nWhat say you to this, sir?\n\nDUKE.\nWhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th’ afternoon?\n\nPROVOST.\nA Bohemian born, but here nursed up and bred; one that is a prisoner nine years old.\n\nDUKE.\nHow came it that the absent Duke had not either delivered him to his liberty, or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.\n\nPROVOST.\nHis friends still wrought reprieves for him; and indeed, his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.\n\nDUKE.\nIt is now apparent?\n\nPROVOST.\nMost manifest, and not denied by himself.\n\nDUKE.\nHath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be touched?\n\nPROVOST.\nA man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless of what’s past, present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately mortal.\n\nDUKE.\nHe wants advice.\n\nPROVOST.\nHe will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming warrant for it. It hath not moved him at all.\n\nDUKE.\nMore of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty and constancy; if I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenced him. To make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite, for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy.\n\nPROVOST.\nPray, sir, in what?\n\nDUKE.\nIn the delaying death.\n\nPROVOST.\nAlack, how may I do it? Having the hour limited, and an express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio’s, to cross this in the smallest.\n\nDUKE.\nBy the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne to Angelo.\n\nPROVOST.\nAngelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.\n\nDUKE.\nO, death’s a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the head and tie the beard, and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death. You know the course is common. If anything fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against it with my life.\n\nPROVOST.\nPardon me, good father; it is against my oath.\n\nDUKE.\nWere you sworn to the Duke, or to the Deputy?\n\nPROVOST.\nTo him and to his substitutes.\n\nDUKE.\nYou will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice of your dealing?\n\nPROVOST.\nBut what likelihood is in that?\n\nDUKE.\nNot a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange to you.\n\nPROVOST.\nI know them both.\n\nDUKE.\nThe contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour, perchance of the Duke’s death, perchance entering into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be. All difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Most damned Angelo!\n\nDUKE.\nThis nor hurts him nor profits you a jot.\nForbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.\nMark what I say, which you shall find\nBy every syllable a faithful verity.\nThe Duke comes home tomorrow;—nay, dry your eyes.\nOne of our convent, and his confessor,\nGives me this instance. Already he hath carried\nNotice to Escalus and Angelo,\nWho do prepare to meet him at the gates,\nThere to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom\nIn that good path that I would wish it go,\nAnd you shall have your bosom on this wretch,\nGrace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,\nAnd general honour.\n\nISABELLA.\nI am directed by you.\n\nDUKE.\nThis letter, then, to Friar Peter give;\n’Tis that he sent me of the Duke’s return.\nSay, by this token, I desire his company\nAt Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours\nI’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you\nBefore the Duke; and to the head of Angelo\nAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,\nI am combined by a sacred vow,\nAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.\nCommand these fretting waters from your eyes\nWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,\nIf I pervert your course.—Who’s here?\n\nEnter Lucio.\n\nLUCIO.\nGood even. Friar, where is the Provost?\n\nDUKE.\nNot within, sir.\n\nLUCIO.\nO pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran. I dare not for my head fill my belly. One fruitful meal would set me to’t. But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother. If the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home, he had lived.\n\n[Exit Isabella.]\n\nDUKE.\nSir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.\n\nLUCIO.\nFriar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do. He’s a better woodman than thou tak’st him for.\n\nDUKE.\nWell, you’ll answer this one day. Fare ye well.\n\nLUCIO.\nNay, tarry, I’ll go along with thee. I can tell thee pretty tales of the Duke.\n\nDUKE.\nYou have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be true; if not true, none were enough.\n\nLUCIO.\nI was once before him for getting a wench with child.\n\nDUKE.\nDid you such a thing?\n\nLUCIO.\nYes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it. They would else have married me to the rotten medlar.\n\nDUKE.\nSir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.\n\nLUCIO.\nBy my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If bawdy talk offend you, we’ll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A public place near the city gate.\nEnter at several doors Duke, Varrius, Lords; Angelo, Escalus, Lucio, Provost, Officers and Citizens.\n\nDUKE.\nMy very worthy cousin, fairly met.\nOur old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.\n\nANGELO and ESCALUS.\nHappy return be to your royal grace!\n\nDUKE.\nMany and hearty thankings to you both.\nWe have made inquiry of you, and we hear\nSuch goodness of your justice that our soul\nCannot but yield you forth to public thanks,\nForerunning more requital.\n\nANGELO.\nYou make my bonds still greater.\n\nDUKE.\nO, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it\nTo lock it in the wards of covert bosom,\nWhen it deserves with characters of brass\nA forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time\nAnd rasure of oblivion. Give me your hand\nAnd let the subject see, to make them know\nThat outward courtesies would fain proclaim\nFavours that keep within.—Come, Escalus,\nYou must walk by us on our other hand.\nAnd good supporters are you.\n\nEnter Friar Peter and Isabella.\n\nFRIAR PETER.\nNow is your time. Speak loud, and kneel before him.\n\nISABELLA.\nJustice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard\nUpon a wronged—I would fain have said, a maid.\nO worthy prince, dishonour not your eye\nBy throwing it on any other object\nTill you have heard me in my true complaint,\nAnd given me justice, justice, justice, justice!\n\nDUKE.\nRelate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.\nHere is Lord Angelo shall give you justice.\nReveal yourself to him.\n\nISABELLA.\nO worthy Duke,\nYou bid me seek redemption of the devil.\nHear me yourself, for that which I must speak\nMust either punish me, not being believed,\nOr wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!\n\nANGELO.\nMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm.\nShe hath been a suitor to me for her brother,\nCut off by course of justice.\n\nISABELLA.\nBy course of justice!\n\nANGELO.\nAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.\n\nISABELLA.\nMost strange, but yet most truly will I speak.\nThat Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange?\nThat Angelo’s a murderer, is’t not strange?\nThat Angelo is an adulterous thief,\nAn hypocrite, a virgin-violator,\nIs it not strange and strange?\n\nDUKE.\nNay, it is ten times strange.\n\nISABELLA.\nIt is not truer he is Angelo\nThan this is all as true as it is strange.\nNay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth\nTo th’ end of reckoning.\n\nDUKE.\nAway with her. Poor soul,\nShe speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense.\n\nISABELLA.\nO Prince, I conjure thee, as thou believ’st\nThere is another comfort than this world,\nThat thou neglect me not with that opinion\nThat I am touched with madness. Make not impossible\nThat which but seems unlike. ’Tis not impossible\nBut one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground,\nMay seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute,\nAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,\nIn all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,\nBe an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince,\nIf he be less, he’s nothing; but he’s more,\nHad I more name for badness.\n\nDUKE.\nBy mine honesty,\nIf she be mad, as I believe no other,\nHer madness hath the oddest frame of sense,\nSuch a dependency of thing on thing,\nAs e’er I heard in madness.\n\nISABELLA.\nO gracious Duke,\nHarp not on that; nor do not banish reason\nFor inequality; but let your reason serve\nTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,\nAnd hide the false seems true.\n\nDUKE.\nMany that are not mad\nHave, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?\n\nISABELLA.\nI am the sister of one Claudio,\nCondemned upon the act of fornication\nTo lose his head; condemned by Angelo.\nI, in probation of a sisterhood,\nWas sent to by my brother; one Lucio\nAs then the messenger.\n\nLUCIO.\nThat’s I, an’t like your Grace.\nI came to her from Claudio and desired her\nTo try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo\nFor her poor brother’s pardon.\n\nISABELLA.\nThat’s he, indeed.\n\nDUKE.\nYou were not bid to speak.\n\nLUCIO.\nNo, my good lord,\nNor wished to hold my peace.\n\nDUKE.\nI wish you now, then;\nPray you take note of it; and when you have\nA business for yourself, pray heaven you then\nBe perfect.\n\nLUCIO.\nI warrant your honour.\n\nDUKE.\nThe warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to it.\n\nISABELLA.\nThis gentleman told somewhat of my tale.\n\nLUCIO.\nRight.\n\nDUKE.\nIt may be right, but you are i’ the wrong\nTo speak before your time.—Proceed.\n\nISABELLA.\nI went\nTo this pernicious caitiff deputy.\n\nDUKE.\nThat’s somewhat madly spoken.\n\nISABELLA.\nPardon it;\nThe phrase is to the matter.\n\nDUKE.\nMended again. The matter; proceed.\n\nISABELLA.\nIn brief, to set the needless process by:\nHow I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled,\nHow he refelled me, and how I replied—\nFor this was of much length—the vile conclusion\nI now begin with grief and shame to utter.\nHe would not, but by gift of my chaste body\nTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,\nRelease my brother; and after much debatement,\nMy sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,\nAnd I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,\nHis purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant\nFor my poor brother’s head.\n\nDUKE.\nThis is most likely!\n\nISABELLA.\nO, that it were as like as it is true!\n\nDUKE.\nBy heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what thou speak’st,\nOr else thou art suborned against his honour\nIn hateful practice. First, his integrity\nStands without blemish; next, it imports no reason\nThat with such vehemency he should pursue\nFaults proper to himself. If he had so offended,\nHe would have weighed thy brother by himself,\nAnd not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on.\nConfess the truth, and say by whose advice\nThou cam’st here to complain.\n\nISABELLA.\nAnd is this all?\nThen, O you blessed ministers above,\nKeep me in patience, and with ripened time\nUnfold the evil which is here wrapt up\nIn countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,\nAs I, thus wronged, hence unbelieved go.\n\nDUKE.\nI know you’d fain be gone. An officer!\nTo prison with her! Shall we thus permit\nA blasting and a scandalous breath to fall\nOn him so near us? This needs must be a practice.\nWho knew of your intent and coming hither?\n\nISABELLA.\nOne that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.\n\n[Exeunt Officer with Isabella.]\n\nDUKE.\nA ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?\n\nLUCIO.\nMy lord, I know him. ’Tis a meddling friar.\nI do not like the man. Had he been lay, my lord,\nFor certain words he spake against your Grace\nIn your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.\n\nDUKE.\nWords against me? This’s a good friar, belike.\nAnd to set on this wretched woman here\nAgainst our substitute! Let this friar be found.\n\nLUCIO.\nBut yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,\nI saw them at the prison. A saucy friar,\nA very scurvy fellow.\n\nFRIAR PETER.\nBlessed be your royal Grace!\nI have stood by, my lord, and I have heard\nYour royal ear abused. First hath this woman\nMost wrongfully accused your substitute,\nWho is as free from touch or soil with her\nAs she from one ungot.\n\nDUKE.\nWe did believe no less.\nKnow you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?\n\nFRIAR PETER.\nI know him for a man divine and holy,\nNot scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,\nAs he’s reported by this gentleman;\nAnd, on my trust, a man that never yet\nDid, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.\n\nLUCIO.\nMy lord, most villainously; believe it.\n\nFRIAR PETER.\nWell, he in time may come to clear himself;\nBut at this instant he is sick, my lord,\nOf a strange fever. Upon his mere request,\nBeing come to knowledge that there was complaint\nIntended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither\nTo speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know\nIs true and false; and what he with his oath\nAnd all probation will make up full clear\nWhensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman,\nTo justify this worthy nobleman,\nSo vulgarly and personally accused,\nHer shall you hear disproved to her eyes,\nTill she herself confess it.\n\nDUKE.\nGood friar, let’s hear it.\nDo you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?\nO heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!\nGive us some seats.—Come, cousin Angelo,\nIn this I’ll be impartial. Be you judge\nOf your own cause.\n\nEnter Mariana, veiled.\n\nIs this the witness, friar?\nFirst let her show her face, and after speak.\n\nMARIANA.\nPardon, my lord; I will not show my face\nUntil my husband bid me.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat, are you married?\n\nMARIANA.\nNo, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nAre you a maid?\n\nMARIANA.\nNo, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nA widow, then?\n\nMARIANA.\nNeither, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy, you are nothing then, neither maid, widow, nor wife?\n\nLUCIO.\nMy lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither maid, widow, nor wife.\n\nDUKE.\nSilence that fellow. I would he had some cause to prattle for himself.\n\nLUCIO.\nWell, my lord.\n\nMARIANA.\nMy lord, I do confess I ne’er was married,\nAnd I confess besides, I am no maid.\nI have known my husband; yet my husband\nKnows not that ever he knew me.\n\nLUCIO.\nHe was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.\n\nDUKE.\nFor the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too.\n\nLUCIO.\nWell, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nThis is no witness for Lord Angelo.\n\nMARIANA.\nNow I come to’t, my lord.\nShe that accuses him of fornication\nIn self-same manner doth accuse my husband,\nAnd charges him, my lord, with such a time\nWhen I’ll depose I had him in mine arms\nWith all th’ effect of love.\n\nANGELO.\nCharges she more than me?\n\nMARIANA.\nNot that I know.\n\nDUKE.\nNo? You say your husband.\n\nMARIANA.\nWhy, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,\nWho thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body,\nBut knows, he thinks, that he knows Isabel’s.\n\nANGELO.\nThis is a strange abuse. Let’s see thy face.\n\nMARIANA.\nMy husband bids me; now I will unmask. [Unveiling.]\nThis is that face, thou cruel Angelo,\nWhich once thou swor’st was worth the looking on.\nThis is the hand which, with a vowed contract,\nWas fast belocked in thine. This is the body\nThat took away the match from Isabel\nAnd did supply thee at thy garden-house\nIn her imagined person.\n\nDUKE.\nKnow you this woman?\n\nLUCIO.\nCarnally, she says.\n\nDUKE.\nSirrah, no more.\n\nLUCIO.\nEnough, my lord.\n\nANGELO.\nMy lord, I must confess I know this woman;\nAnd five years since there was some speech of marriage\nBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,\nPartly for that her promised proportions\nCame short of composition; but in chief\nFor that her reputation was disvalued\nIn levity. Since which time of five years\nI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,\nUpon my faith and honour.\n\nMARIANA.\nNoble Prince,\nAs there comes light from heaven and words from breath,\nAs there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,\nI am affianced this man’s wife as strongly\nAs words could make up vows. And, my good lord,\nBut Tuesday night last gone, in’s garden-house,\nHe knew me as a wife. As this is true,\nLet me in safety raise me from my knees,\nOr else for ever be confixed here,\nA marble monument!\n\nANGELO.\nI did but smile till now.\nNow, good my lord, give me the scope of justice.\nMy patience here is touched. I do perceive\nThese poor informal women are no more\nBut instruments of some more mightier member\nThat sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,\nTo find this practice out.\n\nDUKE.\nAy, with my heart;\nAnd punish them to your height of pleasure.\nThou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,\nCompact with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy oaths,\nThough they would swear down each particular saint,\nWere testimonies against his worth and credit,\nThat’s sealed in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,\nSit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains\nTo find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived.\nThere is another friar that set them on;\nLet him be sent for.\n\nFRIAR PETER.\nWould he were here, my lord; for he indeed\nHath set the women on to this complaint.\nYour Provost knows the place where he abides,\nAnd he may fetch him.\n\nDUKE.\nGo, do it instantly.\n\n[Exit Provost.]\n\nAnd you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,\nWhom it concerns to hear this matter forth,\nDo with your injuries as seems you best\nIn any chastisement. I for a while\nWill leave you; but stir not you till you have\nWell determined upon these slanderers.\n\nESCALUS.\nMy lord, we’ll do it throughly.\n\n[Exit Duke.]\n\nSignior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?\n\nLUCIO.\nCucullus non facit monachum, honest in nothing but in his clothes, and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the Duke.\n\nESCALUS.\nWe shall entreat you to abide here till he come, and enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable fellow.\n\nLUCIO.\nAs any in Vienna, on my word.\n\nESCALUS.\nCall that same Isabel here once again. I would speak with her.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nPray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you shall see how I’ll handle her.\n\nLUCIO.\nNot better than he, by her own report.\n\nESCALUS.\nSay you?\n\nLUCIO.\nMarry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she’ll be ashamed.\n\nEnter at several doors Duke as a friar, Provost and Isabella with Officers.\n\nESCALUS.\nI will go darkly to work with her.\n\nLUCIO.\nThat’s the way; for women are light at midnight.\n\nESCALUS.\n[To Isabella.] Come on, mistress, here’s a gentlewoman denies all that you have said.\n\nLUCIO.\nMy lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the Provost.\n\nESCALUS.\nIn very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon you.\n\nLUCIO.\nMum.\n\nESCALUS.\nCome, sir, did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have confessed you did.\n\nDUKE.\n’Tis false.\n\nESCALUS.\nHow! Know you where you are?\n\nDUKE.\nRespect to your great place; and let the devil\nBe sometime honoured for his burning throne.\nWhere is the Duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak.\n\nESCALUS.\nThe Duke’s in us; and we will hear you speak.\nLook you speak justly.\n\nDUKE.\nBoldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,\nCome you to seek the lamb here of the fox,\nGood night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?\nThen is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust\nThus to retort your manifest appeal,\nAnd put your trial in the villain’s mouth\nWhich here you come to accuse.\n\nLUCIO.\nThis is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.\n\nESCALUS.\nWhy, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,\nIs’t not enough thou hast suborned these women\nTo accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,\nAnd in the witness of his proper ear,\nTo call him villain? And then to glance from him\nTo th’ Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?\nTake him hence! To th’ rack with him! We’ll touse you\nJoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.\nWhat! Unjust?\n\nDUKE.\nBe not so hot. The Duke\nDare no more stretch this finger of mine than he\nDare rack his own. His subject am I not,\nNor here provincial. My business in this state\nMade me a looker-on here in Vienna,\nWhere I have seen corruption boil and bubble\nTill it o’errun the stew. Laws for all faults,\nBut faults so countenanced that the strong statutes\nStand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop,\nAs much in mock as mark.\n\nESCALUS.\nSlander to the state! Away with him to prison!\n\nANGELO.\nWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?\nIs this the man that you did tell us of?\n\nLUCIO.\n’Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman Baldpate.\nDo you know me?\n\nDUKE.\nI remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the prison, in the absence of the Duke.\n\nLUCIO.\nO did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?\n\nDUKE.\nMost notedly, sir.\n\nLUCIO.\nDo you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?\n\nDUKE.\nYou must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report. You indeed spoke so of him, and much more, much worse.\n\nLUCIO.\nO thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches?\n\nDUKE.\nI protest I love the Duke as I love myself.\n\nANGELO.\nHark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable abuses!\n\nESCALUS.\nSuch a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts enough upon him. Let him speak no more. Away with those giglets too, and with the other confederate companion!\n\n[The Provost lays hands on the Duke.]\n\nDUKE.\nStay, sir, stay a while.\n\nANGELO.\nWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.\n\nLUCIO.\nCome, sir, come, sir, come, sir. Foh, sir! Why, you bald-pated lying rascal! You must be hooded, must you? Show your knave’s visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! Will’t not off?\n\n[Pulls off the friar’s hood and discovers the Duke.]\n\nDUKE.\nThou art the first knave that e’er mad’st a duke.\nFirst, Provost, let me bail these gentle three.\n[To Lucio.] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you\nMust have a word anon.—Lay hold on him.\n\nLUCIO.\nThis may prove worse than hanging.\n\nDUKE.\n[To Escalus.] What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down.\nWe’ll borrow place of him. [To Angelo.] Sir, by your leave.\nHast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,\nThat yet can do thee office? If thou hast,\nRely upon it till my tale be heard,\nAnd hold no longer out.\n\nANGELO.\nO my dread lord,\nI should be guiltier than my guiltiness\nTo think I can be undiscernible,\nWhen I perceive your Grace, like power divine,\nHath looked upon my passes. Then, good Prince,\nNo longer session hold upon my shame,\nBut let my trial be mine own confession.\nImmediate sentence then, and sequent death\nIs all the grace I beg.\n\nDUKE.\nCome hither, Mariana.\nSay, wast thou e’er contracted to this woman?\n\nANGELO.\nI was, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nGo, take her hence and marry her instantly.\nDo you the office, friar; which consummate,\nReturn him here again.—Go with him, Provost.\n\n[Exeunt Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost.]\n\nESCALUS.\nMy lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour\nThan at the strangeness of it.\n\nDUKE.\nCome hither, Isabel.\nYour friar is now your prince. As I was then\nAdvertising and holy to your business,\nNot changing heart with habit, I am still\nAttorneyed at your service.\n\nISABELLA.\nO, give me pardon,\nThat I, your vassal, have employed and pained\nYour unknown sovereignty.\n\nDUKE.\nYou are pardoned, Isabel.\nAnd now, dear maid, be you as free to us.\nYour brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart,\nAnd you may marvel why I obscured myself,\nLabouring to save his life, and would not rather\nMake rash remonstrance of my hidden power\nThan let him so be lost. O most kind maid,\nIt was the swift celerity of his death,\nWhich I did think with slower foot came on,\nThat brained my purpose. But peace be with him.\nThat life is better life, past fearing death,\nThan that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,\nSo happy is your brother.\n\nISABELLA.\nI do, my lord.\n\nEnter Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost.\n\nDUKE.\nFor this new-married man approaching here,\nWhose salt imagination yet hath wronged\nYour well-defended honour, you must pardon\nFor Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your brother,\nBeing criminal in double violation\nOf sacred chastity and of promise-breach\nThereon dependent, for your brother’s life,\nThe very mercy of the law cries out\nMost audible, even from his proper tongue,\n“An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.”\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;\nLike doth quit like, and measure still for measure.\nThen, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested,\nWhich, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.\nWe do condemn thee to the very block\nWhere Claudio stooped to death, and with like haste.\nAway with him.\n\nMARIANA.\nO my most gracious lord,\nI hope you will not mock me with a husband.\n\nDUKE.\nIt is your husband mocked you with a husband.\nConsenting to the safeguard of your honour,\nI thought your marriage fit. Else imputation,\nFor that he knew you, might reproach your life,\nAnd choke your good to come. For his possessions,\nAlthough by confiscation they are ours,\nWe do instate and widow you with all\nTo buy you a better husband.\n\nMARIANA.\nO my dear lord,\nI crave no other, nor no better man.\n\nDUKE.\nNever crave him; we are definitive.\n\nMARIANA.\n[Kneeling.] Gentle my liege—\n\nDUKE.\nYou do but lose your labour.\nAway with him to death. [To Lucio.] Now, sir, to you.\n\nMARIANA.\nO my good lord.—Sweet Isabel, take my part;\nLend me your knees, and all my life to come\nI’ll lend you all my life to do you service.\n\nDUKE.\nAgainst all sense you do importune her.\nShould she kneel down in mercy of this fact,\nHer brother’s ghost his paved bed would break,\nAnd take her hence in horror.\n\nMARIANA.\nIsabel,\nSweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;\nHold up your hands, say nothing. I’ll speak all.\nThey say best men are moulded out of faults,\nAnd, for the most, become much more the better\nFor being a little bad. So may my husband.\nO Isabel, will you not lend a knee?\n\nDUKE.\nHe dies for Claudio’s death.\n\nISABELLA.\n[Kneeling.] Most bounteous sir,\nLook, if it please you, on this man condemned\nAs if my brother lived. I partly think\nA due sincerity governed his deeds\nTill he did look on me. Since it is so,\nLet him not die. My brother had but justice,\nIn that he did the thing for which he died.\nFor Angelo,\nHis act did not o’ertake his bad intent,\nAnd must be buried but as an intent\nThat perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;\nIntents but merely thoughts.\n\nMARIANA.\nMerely, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nYour suit’s unprofitable. Stand up, I say.\nI have bethought me of another fault.\nProvost, how came it Claudio was beheaded\nAt an unusual hour?\n\nPROVOST.\nIt was commanded so.\n\nDUKE.\nHad you a special warrant for the deed?\n\nPROVOST.\nNo, my good lord, it was by private message.\n\nDUKE.\nFor which I do discharge you of your office.\nGive up your keys.\n\nPROVOST.\nPardon me, noble lord.\nI thought it was a fault, but knew it not;\nYet did repent me after more advice.\nFor testimony whereof, one in the prison\nThat should by private order else have died,\nI have reserved alive.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat’s he?\n\nPROVOST.\nHis name is Barnardine.\n\nDUKE.\nI would thou hadst done so by Claudio.\nGo fetch him hither, let me look upon him.\n\n[Exit Provost.]\n\nESCALUS.\nI am sorry one so learned and so wise\nAs you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared,\nShould slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood\nAnd lack of tempered judgement afterward.\n\nANGELO.\nI am sorry that such sorrow I procure,\nAnd so deep sticks it in my penitent heart\nThat I crave death more willingly than mercy;\n’Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.\n\nEnter Provost with Barnardine, Claudio (muffled) and Juliet.\n\nDUKE.\nWhich is that Barnardine?\n\nPROVOST.\nThis, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nThere was a friar told me of this man.\nSirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul\nThat apprehends no further than this world,\nAnd squar’st thy life according. Thou’rt condemned;\nBut, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,\nAnd pray thee take this mercy to provide\nFor better times to come. Friar, advise him;\nI leave him to your hand.—What muffled fellow’s that?\n\nPROVOST.\nThis is another prisoner that I saved,\nWho should have died when Claudio lost his head;\nAs like almost to Claudio as himself.\n\n[Unmuffles Claudio.]\n\nDUKE.\n[To Isabella.] If he be like your brother, for his sake\nIs he pardoned; and for your lovely sake,\nGive me your hand and say you will be mine.\nHe is my brother too. But fitter time for that.\nBy this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe;\nMethinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.\nWell, Angelo, your evil quits you well.\nLook that you love your wife, her worth worth yours.\nI find an apt remission in myself.\nAnd yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon.\n[To Lucio.] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,\nOne all of luxury, an ass, a madman.\nWherein have I so deserved of you\nThat you extol me thus?\n\nLUCIO.\nFaith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. If you will hang me for it, you may, but I had rather it would please you I might be whipped.\n\nDUKE.\nWhipped first, sir, and hanged after.\nProclaim it, Provost, round about the city,\nIf any woman wronged by this lewd fellow,\nAs I have heard him swear himself there’s one\nWhom he begot with child—let her appear,\nAnd he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,\nLet him be whipped and hanged.\n\nLUCIO.\nI beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your highness said even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.\n\nDUKE.\nUpon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.\nThy slanders I forgive, and therewithal\nRemit thy other forfeits.—Take him to prison,\nAnd see our pleasure herein executed.\n\nLUCIO.\nMarrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.\n\nDUKE.\nSlandering a prince deserves it.\n\n[Exeunt Officers with Lucio.]\n\nShe, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore.\nJoy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo.\nI have confessed her, and I know her virtue.\nThanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness;\nThere’s more behind that is more gratulate.\nThanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy;\nWe shall employ thee in a worthier place.\nForgive him, Angelo, that brought you home\nThe head of Ragozine for Claudio’s.\nTh’ offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,\nI have a motion much imports your good;\nWhereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,\nWhat’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.\nSo, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show\nWhat’s yet behind that’s meet you all should know.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
