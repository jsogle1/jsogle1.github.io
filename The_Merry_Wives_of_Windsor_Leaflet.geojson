    "content":"SCENE: Windsor, and the neighbourhood\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor\n\nACT I. SCENE 1.\nWindsor. Before PAGE'S house\n\nEnter JUSTICE SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n\n  SHALLOW. Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star\n    Chamber matter of it; if he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs,\n    he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.\n  SLENDER. In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace, and\n    Coram.\n  SHALLOW. Ay, cousin Slender, and Custalorum.\n  SLENDER. Ay, and Ratolorum too; and a gentleman born,\n    Master Parson, who writes himself 'Armigero' in any bill,\n    warrant, quittance, or obligation-'Armigero.'\n  SHALLOW. Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three\n    hundred years.\n  SLENDER. All his successors, gone before him, hath done't;\n    and all his ancestors, that come after him, may: they may\n    give the dozen white luces in their coat.\n  SHALLOW. It is an old coat.\n  EVANS. The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;\n    it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and\n    signifies love.\n  SHALLOW. The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old\n    coat.\n  SLENDER. I may quarter, coz.\n  SHALLOW. You may, by marrying.\n  EVANS. It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.\n  SHALLOW. Not a whit.\n  EVANS. Yes, py'r lady! If he has a quarter of your coat, there\n    is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures;\n    but that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed\n    disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and will be\n    glad to do my benevolence, to make atonements and\n    compremises between you.\n  SHALLOW. The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.\n  EVANS. It is not meet the Council hear a riot; there is no\n    fear of Got in a riot; the Council, look you, shall desire\n    to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot; take your\n    vizaments in that.\n  SHALLOW. Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword\n    should end it.\n  EVANS. It is petter that friends is the sword and end it;\n    and there is also another device in my prain, which\n    peradventure prings goot discretions with it. There is Anne\n    Page, which is daughter to Master George Page, which is\n    pretty virginity.\n  SLENDER. Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and\n    speaks small like a woman.\n  EVANS. It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as you\n    will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and\n    gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon his death's-bed-Got\n    deliver to a joyful resurrections!-give, when she is able to\n    overtake seventeen years old. It were a goot motion if we\n    leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage\n    between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.\n  SHALLOW. Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?\n  EVANS. Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.\n  SHALLOW. I know the young gentlewoman; she has good\n    gifts.\n  EVANS. Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is goot gifts.\n  SHALLOW. Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff\n    there?\n  EVANS. Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do\n    despise one that is false; or as I despise one that is not\n    true. The knight Sir John is there; and, I beseech you, be\n    ruled by your well-willers. I will peat the door for Master\n    Page.\n    [Knocks] What, hoa! Got pless your house here!\n  PAGE. [Within] Who's there?\nEnter PAGE\n\n  EVANS. Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice\n  Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that peradventures\n    shall tell you another tale, if matters grow to your\n    likings.\n  PAGE. I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for\n    my venison, Master Shallow.\n  SHALLOW. Master Page, I am glad to see you; much good do\n    it your good heart! I wish'd your venison better; it was ill\n    kill'd. How doth good Mistress Page?-and I thank you\n    always with my heart, la! with my heart.\n  PAGE. Sir, I thank you.\n  SHALLOW. Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.\n  PAGE. I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.\n  SLENDER. How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say\n    he was outrun on Cotsall.\n  PAGE. It could not be judg'd, sir.\n  SLENDER. You'll not confess, you'll not confess.\n  SHALLOW. That he will not. 'Tis your fault; 'tis your fault;\n    'tis a good dog.\n  PAGE. A cur, sir.\n  SHALLOW. Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog. Can there be\n    more said? He is good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?\n  PAGE. Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office\n    between you.\n  EVANS. It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.\n  SHALLOW. He hath wrong'd me, Master Page.\n  PAGE. Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.\n  SHALLOW. If it be confessed, it is not redressed; is not that\n    so, Master Page? He hath wrong'd me; indeed he hath; at a\n    word, he hath, believe me; Robert Shallow, esquire, saith\n    he is wronged.\n  PAGE. Here comes Sir John.\nEnter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL\n\n  FALSTAFF. Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to\n    the King?\n  SHALLOW. Knight, you have beaten my men, kill'd my deer,\n    and broke open my lodge.\n  FALSTAFF. But not kiss'd your keeper's daughter.\n  SHALLOW. Tut, a pin! this shall be answer'd.\n  FALSTAFF. I will answer it straight: I have done all this.\n    That is now answer'd.\n  SHALLOW. The Council shall know this.\n  FALSTAFF. 'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:\n    you'll be laugh'd at.\n  EVANS. Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.\n  FALSTAFF. Good worts! good cabbage! Slender, I broke your\n    head; what matter have you against me?\n  SLENDER. Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;\n    and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym,\n    and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern, and made me\n    drunk, and afterwards pick'd my pocket.\n  BARDOLPH. You Banbury cheese!\n  SLENDER. Ay, it is no matter.\n  PISTOL. How now, Mephostophilus!\n  SLENDER. Ay, it is no matter.\n  NYM. Slice, I say! pauca, pauca; slice! That's my humour.\n  SLENDER. Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?\n  EVANS. Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is\n    three umpires in this matter, as I understand: that is,\n    Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is myself,\n    fidelicet myself; and the three party is, lastly and\n    finally, mine host of the Garter.\n  PAGE. We three to hear it and end it between them.\n  EVANS. Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my note-book;\n    and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with as great\n    discreetly as we can.\n  FALSTAFF. Pistol!\n  PISTOL. He hears with ears.\n  EVANS. The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, 'He hears\n    with ear'? Why, it is affectations.\n  FALSTAFF. Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?\n  SLENDER. Ay, by these gloves, did he-or I would I might\n    never come in mine own great chamber again else!-of\n    seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward\n    shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence apiece\n    of Yead Miller, by these gloves.\n  FALSTAFF. Is this true, Pistol?\n  EVANS. No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.\n  PISTOL. Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and master\n    mine,\n    I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.\n    Word of denial in thy labras here!\n    Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.\n  SLENDER. By these gloves, then, 'twas he.\n  NYM. Be avis'd, sir, and pass good humours; I will say\n    'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's humour on\n    me; that is the very note of it.\n  SLENDER. By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for\n    though I cannot remember what I did when you made me\n    drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.\n  FALSTAFF. What say you, Scarlet and John?\n  BARDOLPH. Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had\n    drunk himself out of his five sentences.\n  EVANS. It is his five senses; fie, what the ignorance is!\n  BARDOLPH. And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd;\n    and so conclusions pass'd the careers.\n  SLENDER. Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no matter;\n    I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest,\n    civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be drunk, I'll be\n    drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with\n    drunken knaves.\n  EVANS. So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.\n  FALSTAFF. You hear all these matters deni'd, gentlemen; you\n    hear it.\n          Enter MISTRESS ANNE PAGE with wine; MISTRESS\n               FORD and MISTRESS PAGE, following\n  PAGE. Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.\n                                                  Exit ANNE PAGE\n  SLENDER. O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.\n  PAGE. How now, Mistress Ford!\n  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well\n    met; by your leave, good mistress. [Kisses her]\n  PAGE. Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a\n    hot venison pasty to dinner; come, gentlemen, I hope we\n    shall drink down all unkindness.\n                      Exeunt all but SHALLOW, SLENDER, and EVANS\n  SLENDER. I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of\n    Songs and Sonnets here.\nEnter SIMPLE\n\n    How, Simple! Where have you been? I must wait on\n    myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles about you,\n    have you?\n  SIMPLE. Book of Riddles! Why, did you not lend it to Alice\n    Shortcake upon Allhallowmas last, a fortnight afore\n    Michaelmas?\n  SHALLOW. Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word\n    with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a\n    tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do\n    you understand me?\n  SLENDER. Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so, I\n    shall do that that is reason.\n  SHALLOW. Nay, but understand me.\n  SLENDER. So I do, sir.\n  EVANS. Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I will\n    description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.\n  SLENDER. Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says; I pray\n    you pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country,\n    simple though I stand here.\n  EVANS. But that is not the question. The question is\n    concerning your marriage.\n  SHALLOW. Ay, there's the point, sir.\n  EVANS. Marry is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne\n    Page.\n  SLENDER. Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any\n    reasonable demands.\n  EVANS. But can you affection the oman? Let us command to\n    know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers\nphilosophers\n    hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore,\n    precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?\n  SHALLOW. Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?\n  SLENDER. I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that\n    would do reason.\n  EVANS. Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak\npossitable,\n    if you can carry her your desires towards her.\n  SHALLOW. That you must. Will you, upon good dowry,\n    marry her?\n  SLENDER. I will do a greater thing than that upon your request,\n    cousin, in any reason.\n  SHALLOW. Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what\n    I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?\n  SLENDER. I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there\n    be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease\n    it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and\n    have more occasion to know one another. I hope upon\n    familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say\n    'marry her,' I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved,\n    and dissolutely.\n  EVANS. It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the\n    ord 'dissolutely': the ort is, according to our meaning,\n    'resolutely'; his meaning is good.\n  SHALLOW. Ay, I think my cousin meant well.\n  SLENDER. Ay, or else I would I might be hang'd, la!\nRe-enter ANNE PAGE\n\n  SHALLOW. Here comes fair Mistress Anne. Would I were\n    young for your sake, Mistress Anne!\n  ANNE. The dinner is on the table; my father desires your\n    worships' company.\n  SHALLOW. I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne!\n  EVANS. Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.\n                                        Exeunt SHALLOW and EVANS\n  ANNE. Will't please your worship to come in, sir?\n  SLENDER. No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very\n    well.\n  ANNE. The dinner attends you, sir.\n  SLENDER. I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,\n    sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin\n  Shallow. [Exit SIMPLE] A justice of peace sometime may\n    be beholding to his friend for a man. I keep but three men\n    and a boy yet, till my mother be dead. But what though?\n    Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.\n  ANNE. I may not go in without your worship; they will not\n    sit till you come.\n  SLENDER. I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as\n    though I did.\n  ANNE. I pray you, sir, walk in.\n  SLENDER. I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruis'd my\n    shin th' other day with playing at sword and dagger with\n    a master of fence-three veneys for a dish of stew'd prunes\n    -and, I with my ward defending my head, he hot my shin,\n    and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat\n    since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i' th'\n    town?\n  ANNE. I think there are, sir; I heard them talk'd of.\n  SLENDER. I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at\n    it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see the\n    bear loose, are you not?\n  ANNE. Ay, indeed, sir.\n  SLENDER. That's meat and drink to me now. I have seen\n    Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the\n    chain; but I warrant you, the women have so cried and\n    shriek'd at it that it pass'd; but women, indeed, cannot\n    abide 'em; they are very ill-favour'd rough things.\nRe-enter PAGE\n\n  PAGE. Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.\n  SLENDER. I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.\n  PAGE. By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come,\n    come.\n  SLENDER. Nay, pray you lead the way.\n  PAGE. Come on, sir.\n  SLENDER. Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.\n  ANNE. Not I, sir; pray you keep on.\n  SLENDER. Truly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do\n    you that wrong.\n  ANNE. I pray you, sir.\n  SLENDER. I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You\n    do yourself wrong indeed, la! Exeunt",

O base Hungarian wight! Wilt thou the spigot\n    wield? Exit BARDOLPH\n  NYM. He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?\n  FALSTAFF. I am glad I am so acquit of this tinder-box: his\n    thefts were too open; his filching was like an unskilful\n    singer-he kept not time.\n  NYM.

I ken the wight; he is of substance good.\n  FALSTAFF. My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.\n  PISTOL. Two yards, and more.\n  FALSTAFF. No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the waist\n    two yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about\n    thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's wife; I\n    spy entertainment in her; she discourses, she carves, she\n    gives the leer of invitation; I can construe the action of\nher\n    familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be\n    English'd rightly, is 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'\n    PISTOL. He hath studied her well, and translated her will out\n    of honesty into English.\n  NYM. The anchor is deep; will that humour pass?\n  FALSTAFF. Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her\n    husband's purse; he hath a legion of angels.\n  PISTOL. As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.\n  NYM. The humour rises; it is good; humour me the angels.\n  FALSTAFF. I have writ me here a letter to her; and here\n    another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good eyes\n    too, examin'd my parts with most judicious oeillades;\n    sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes my\n    portly belly.\n  PISTOL.

O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such\n    a greedy intention that the appetite of her eye did seem to\n    scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's another letter to\n    her. She bears the purse too; she is a region in Guiana, all\n    gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them both, and they\n    shall be exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West\n    Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear thou this\n    letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress Ford. We\n    will thrive, lads, we will thrive.\n  PISTOL. Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,\n    And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!\n  NYM. I will run no base humour.

With both the humours, I.\n    I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.\n  PISTOL. And I to Ford shall eke unfold\n    How Falstaff, varlet vile,\n    His dove will prove, his gold will hold,\n    And his soft couch defile.\n  NYM.

Does he not wear a great round beard, like a\n    glover's paring-knife?\n  SIMPLE. No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a\n    little yellow beard, a Cain-colour'd beard.\n  QUICKLY. A softly-sprighted man, is he not?\n  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as\n    any is between this and his head; he hath fought with a\n    warrener.\n  QUICKLY. How say you? O, I should remember him. Does\n    he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?\n  SIMPLE. Yes, indeed, does he.\n  QUICKLY.

Ay, forsooth, I'll fetch it you. [Aside] I am glad\n    he went not in himself; if he had found the young man,\n    he would have been horn-mad.\n  CAIUS. Fe, fe, fe fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud.

O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villainy! larron!\n    [Pulling SIMPLE out] Rugby, my rapier!\n  QUICKLY. Good master, be content.\n  CAIUS. Wherefore shall I be content-a?\n  QUICKLY. The young man is an honest man.\n  CAIUS. What shall de honest man do in my closet? Dere is\n    no honest man dat shall come in my closet.\n  QUICKLY. I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic; hear the\n    truth of it. He came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.\n  CAIUS. Vell?\n  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth, to desire her to-\n  QUICKLY. Peace, I pray you.\n  CAIUS. Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.\n  SIMPLE. To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to\n    speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master,\n    in the way of marriage.\n  QUICKLY. This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my finger\n    in the fire, and need not.\n  CAIUS. Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baillez me some paper.\n    Tarry you a little-a-while. [Writes]\n  QUICKLY. [Aside to SIMPLE] I am glad he is so quiet; if he\n    had been throughly moved, you should have heard him\n    so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man, I'll\n    do you your master what good I can; and the very yea and\n    the no is, the French doctor, my master-I may call him\n    my master, look you, for I keep his house; and I wash,\n    wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink, make the\n    beds, and do all myself-\n  SIMPLE. [Aside to QUICKLY] 'Tis a great charge to come\n    under one body's hand.\n  QUICKLY. [Aside to SIMPLE] Are you avis'd o' that? You\n    shall find it a great charge; and to be up early and down\n    late; but notwithstanding-to tell you in your ear, I would\n    have no words of it-my master himself is in love with\n    Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know\n    Anne's mind-that's neither here nor there.\n  CAIUS. You jack'nape; give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by gar,\n    it is a shallenge; I will cut his troat in de park; and I\nwill\n    teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make. You\n    may be gone; it is not good you tarry here. By gar, I will\n    cut all his two stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone\n    to throw at his dog. Exit SIMPLE\n  QUICKLY. Alas, he speaks but for his friend.\n  CAIUS. It is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a me dat I\n    shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack\n    priest; and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer to\n    measure our weapon. By gar, I will myself have Anne\n    Page.\n  QUICKLY. Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We\n    must give folks leave to prate. What the good-year!\n  CAIUS. Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have\n    not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door.\n    Follow my heels, Rugby. Exeunt CAIUS and RUGBY\n  QUICKLY. You shall have-An fool's-head of your own. No,\n    I know Anne's mind for that; never a woman in Windsor\n    knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more\n    than I do with her, I thank heaven.\n  FENTON. [Within] Who's within there? ho!\n  QUICKLY. Who's there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray\n    you.\nEnter FENTON\n\n  FENTON. How now, good woman, how dost thou?\n  QUICKLY. The better that it pleases your good worship to\n    ask.\n  FENTON. What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?\n  QUICKLY. In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and\n    gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by\n    the way; I praise heaven for it.\n  FENTON. Shall I do any good, think'st thou? Shall I not lose\n    my suit?\n  QUICKLY. Troth, sir, all is in His hands above; but\n    notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book\n    she loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?\n  FENTON. Yes, marry, have I; what of that?\n  QUICKLY. Well, thereby hangs a tale; good faith, it is such\n    another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever broke\n    bread. We had an hour's talk of that wart; I shall never\n    laugh but in that maid's company! But, indeed, she is\n    given too much to allicholy and musing; but for you-well,\n    go to.\n  FENTON. Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money\n    for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf. If thou seest\n    her before me, commend me.\n  QUICKLY. Will I? I' faith, that we will; and I will tell your\n    worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence;\n    and of other wooers.\n  FENTON. Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.\n  QUICKLY. Farewell to your worship. [Exit FENTON] Truly,\n    an honest gentleman; but Anne loves him not; for I know\n    Anne's mind as well as another does. Out upon 't, what\n    have I forgot? Exit",

What! have I scap'd love-letters in the holiday-time\n    of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let\n    me see. [Reads]\n    'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though Love use\n    Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for his\ncounsellor.\n    You are not young, no more am I; go to, then, there's\n    sympathy. You are merry, so am I; ha! ha! then there's\n    more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I; would you\n    desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page\n    at the least, if the love of soldier can suffice-that I love\n    thee. I will not say, Pity me: 'tis not a soldier-like\nphrase;\n    but I say, Love me. By me,\n    Thine own true knight,\n    By day or night,\n    Or any kind of light,\n    With all his might,\n    For thee to fight,\n    JOHN FALSTAFF.'\n    What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world!\n    One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show\n    himself a young gallant! What an unweighed behaviour\n    hath this Flemish drunkard pick'd-with the devil's name!\n    -out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner\n    assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!\n    What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth.\n    Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill in the parliament\n    for the putting down of men. How shall I be\n    reveng'd on him? for reveng'd I will be, as sure as his guts\n    are made of puddings.\nEnter MISTRESS FORD\n\n  MRS. FORD. Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your\n    house.\n  MRS. PAGE. And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look\n    very ill.\n  MRS. FORD. Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to\n    the contrary.\n  MRS. PAGE. Faith, but you do, in my mind.\n  MRS. FORD. Well, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show you to\n    the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel.\n  MRS. PAGE. What's the matter, woman?\n  MRS. FORD. O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect,\n    I could come to such honour!\n  MRS. PAGE. Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What\n    is it? Dispense with trifles; what is it?\n  MRS. FORD. If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment\n    or so, I could be knighted.\n  MRS. PAGE. What? Thou liest. Sir Alice Ford! These knights\n    will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy\n    gentry.\n  MRS. FORD. We burn daylight. Here, read, read; perceive\n    how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat\n    men as long as I have an eye to make difference of men's\n    liking. And yet he would not swear; prais'd women's\n    modesty, and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof\n    to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition\n    would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no\n    more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth\n    Psalm to the tune of 'Greensleeves.' What tempest, I trow,\n    threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly,\n    ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I\n    think the best way were to entertain him with hope, till\n    the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease.\n    Did you ever hear the like?\n  MRS. PAGE. Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and\n    Ford differs. To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill\n    opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy letter; but let\nthine\n    inherit first, for, I protest, mine never shall. I warrant he\n    hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for\n    different names-sure, more!-and these are of the second\n    edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not\n    what he puts into the press when he would put us two. I\n    had rather be a giantess and lie under Mount Pelion. Well,\n    I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste\n    man.\n  MRS. FORD. Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the\n    very words. What doth he think of us?\n  MRS. PAGE. Nay, I know not; it makes me almost ready to\n    wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain myself like\n    one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he\n    know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would\n    never have boarded me in this fury.\n  MRS. FORD. 'Boarding' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him\n    above deck.\n  MRS. PAGE. So will I; if he come under my hatches, I'll never\n    to sea again. Let's be reveng'd on him; let's appoint him a\n    meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead\n    him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawn'd his\n    horses to mine host of the Garter.\n  MRS. FORD. Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against\n    him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O\n    that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food\n    to his jealousy.\n  MRS. PAGE. Why, look where he comes; and my good man\n    too; he's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him\n    cause; and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance.\n  MRS. FORD. You are the happier woman.\n  MRS. PAGE. Let's consult together against this greasy knight.\n    Come hither. [They retire]\nEnter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with Nym\n\n  FORD. Well, I hope it be not so.\n  PISTOL. Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs.\n    Sir John affects thy wife.\n  FORD. Why, sir, my wife is not young.\n  PISTOL. He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,\n    Both young and old, one with another, Ford;\n    He loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend.\n  FORD. Love my wife!\n  PISTOL. With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,\n    Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels.\n    O, odious is the name!\n  FORD. What name, sir?\n  PISTOL. The horn, I say. Farewell.\n    Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night;\n    Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing.\n    Away, Sir Corporal Nym.\n    Believe it, Page; he speaks sense. Exit PISTOL\n  FORD. [Aside] I will be patient; I will find out this.\n  NYM. [To PAGE] And this is true; I like not the humour of\n    lying. He hath wronged me in some humours; I should\n    have borne the humour'd letter to her; but I have a sword,\n    and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves your wife;\n    there's the short and the long.\n    My name is Corporal Nym; I speak, and I avouch;\n    'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.\n    Adieu! I love not the humour of bread and cheese; and\n    there's the humour of it. Adieu. Exit Nym\n  PAGE. 'The humour of it,' quoth 'a! Here's a fellow frights\n    English out of his wits.\n  FORD. I will seek out Falstaff.\n  PAGE. I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.\n  FORD. If I do find it-well.\n  PAGE. I will not believe such a Cataian though the priest o'\n    th' town commended him for a true man.\n  FORD. 'Twas a good sensible fellow. Well.\nMISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward\n\n  PAGE. How now, Meg!\n  MRS. PAGE. Whither go you, George? Hark you.\n  MRS. FORD. How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?\n  FORD. I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home;\n    go.\n  MRS. FORD. Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.\n    Will you go, Mistress Page?\nEnter MISTRESS QUICKLY\n\n  MRS. PAGE. Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George?\n    [Aside to MRS. FORD] Look who comes yonder; she shall\n    be our messenger to this paltry knight.\n  MRS. FORD. [Aside to MRS. PAGE] Trust me, I thought on\n    her; she'll fit it.\n  MRS. PAGE. You are come to see my daughter Anne?\n  QUICKLY. Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress\nAnne?\n  MRS. PAGE. Go in with us and see; we have an hour's talk\n    with you. Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and\n                                                MISTRESS QUICKLY\n  PAGE. How now, Master Ford!\n  FORD. You heard what this knave told me, did you not?\n  PAGE. Yes; and you heard what the other told me?\n  FORD. Do you think there is truth in them?\n  PAGE. Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer\nit;\n    but these that accuse him in his intent towards our\n    wives are a yoke of his discarded men; very rogues, now\n    they be out of service.\n  FORD. Were they his men?\n  PAGE. Marry, were they.\n  FORD. I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the\n    Garter?\n  PAGE. Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage\n    toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what\n    he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.\n  FORD. I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to\n    turn them together. A man may be too confident. I would\n    have nothing lie on my head. I cannot be thus satisfied.\nEnter HOST\n\n  PAGE. Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes.\n    There is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse\n    when he looks so merrily. How now, mine host!\n  HOST. How now, bully rook! Thou'rt a gentleman. [To\n    SHALLOW following] Cavaleiro Justice, I say.\nEnter SHALLOW\n\n  SHALLOW. I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and\n    twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go with\n    us? We have sport in hand.\n  HOST. Tell him, Cavaleiro Justice; tell him, bully rook.\n  SHALLOW. Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh\n    the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.\n  FORD. Good mine host o' th' Garter, a word with you.\n  HOST. What say'st thou, my bully rook? [They go aside]\n  SHALLOW. [To PAGE] Will you go with us to behold it? My\n    merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons; and,\n    I think, hath appointed them contrary places; for, believe\n    me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I will tell you\n    what our sport shall be. [They converse apart]\n  HOST. Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavaleiro.\n  FORD. None, I protest; but I'll give you a pottle of burnt\n    sack to give me recourse to him, and tell him my name is\n    Brook-only for a jest.\n  HOST. My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress-\n    said I well?-and thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry\n    knight. Will you go, Mynheers?\n  SHALLOW. Have with you, mine host.\n  PAGE. I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his\n    rapier.\n  SHALLOW. Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these\n    times you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and\n    I know not what. 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here,\n    'tis here. I have seen the time with my long sword I would\n    have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.\n  HOST. Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?\n  PAGE. Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than\n    fight. Exeunt all but FORD\n  FORD. Though Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on\n    his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so\n    easily. She was in his company at Page's house, and what\n    they made there I know not. Well, I will look further into\n    't, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If I find her\n    honest, I lose not my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis\nlabour\n    well bestowed. Exit",

Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations\n    to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she's as\n    fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will\n    not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in\n    Windsor, whoe'er be the other; and she bade me tell your\n    worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she\n    hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so\n    dote upon a man: surely I think you have charms, la! Yes,\n    in truth.\n  FALSTAFF. Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my\n    good parts aside, I have no other charms.\n  QUICKLY. Blessing on your heart for 't!\n  FALSTAFF. But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and\n    Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?\n  QUICKLY. That were a jest indeed! They have not so little\n    grace, I hope-that were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page\n    would desire you to send her your little page of all loves.\n    Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page;\n    and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in\n    Windsor leads a better life than she does; do what she will,\n    say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she\n    list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she\n    deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she\n    is one. You must send her your page; no remedy.\n  FALSTAFF. Why, I will.\n  QUICKLY. Nay, but do so then; and, look you, he may come\n    and go between you both; and in any case have a\n    nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and the boy\n    never need to understand any thing; for 'tis not good that\n    children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you\n    know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.\n  FALSTAFF. Fare thee well; commend me to them both.\n    There's my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with\n    this woman. [Exeunt QUICKLY and ROBIN] This news\n    distracts me.\n  PISTOL. [Aside] This punk is one of Cupid's carriers;\n    Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights;\n    Give fire; she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all! Exit\n  FALSTAFF. Say'st thou so, old Jack; go thy ways; I'll make\n    more of thy old body than I have done. Will they yet look\n    after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money,\n    be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let them say\n    'tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter.\nEnter BARDOLPH\n\n  BARDOLPH. Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would\n    fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath\n    sent your worship a moming's draught of sack.\n  FALSTAFF. Brook is his name?\n  BARDOLPH. Ay, sir.\n  FALSTAFF. Call him in. [Exit BARDOLPH] Such Brooks are\n    welcome to me, that o'erflows such liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress\n    Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompass'd you? Go to;\n    via! Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised\n\nFORD. Bless you, sir! \n\nFALSTAFF. And you, sir! Would you speak with me? \n\nFORD. I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you. \n\nFALSTAFF. You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer. \n\nExit BARDOLPH \n\nFORD. Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook. \n\nFALSTAFF. Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you. \n\nFORD. Good Sir John, I sue for yours-not to charge you; for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are; the which hath something embold'ned me to this unseason'd intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open. \n\nFALSTAFF. Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on. \n\nFORD. Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me; if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage. \n\nFALSTAFF. Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter. \n\nFORD. I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing. \n\nFALSTAFF. Speak, good Master Brook; I shall be glad to be your servant. \n\nFORD. Sir, I hear you are a scholar-I will be brief with you -and you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection; but, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy is it to be such an offender. \n\nFALSTAFF. Very well, sir; proceed. \n\nFORD. There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband's name is Ford. \n\nFALSTAFF. Well, sir. \n\nFORD. I have long lov'd her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting observance; engross'd opportunities to meet her; fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many to know what she would have given; briefly, I have pursu'd her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received none, unless experience be a jewel; that I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this: 'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues; Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.' \n\nFALSTAFF. Have you receiv'd no promise of satisfaction at her hands? \n\nFORD. Never. \n\nFALSTAFF. Have you importun'd her to such a purpose? \n\nFORD. Never. \n\nFALSTAFF. Of what quality was your love, then? \n\nFORD. Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where erected it. \n\nFALSTAFF. To what purpose have you unfolded this to me? FORD. When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allow'd for your many war-like, courtlike, and learned preparations. \n\nFALSTAFF. O, sir! FORD. Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife; use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you; if any man may, you may as soon as any. \n\nFALSTAFF. Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously. \n\nFORD. O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be look'd against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves; I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which now are too too strongly embattl'd against me. What say you to't, Sir John? \n\nFALSTAFF. Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife. FORD. O good sir! \n\nFALSTAFF. I say you shall. \n\nFORD. Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none. \n\nFALSTAFF. Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to me her assistant, or go-between, parted from me; I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave, her husband, will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall know how I speed. \n\nFORD. I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, Sir? \n\nFALSTAFF. Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not; yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which his wife seems to me well-favour'd. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer; and there's my harvest-home. \n\nFORD. I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him. \n\nFALSTAFF. Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to me soon at night. Exit FORD. \n\nWhat a damn'd Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him; the hour is fix'd; the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abus'd, my coffers ransack'd, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils' additions, the names of fiends. But cuckold! Wittol! Cuckold! the devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife; he will not be jealous; I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais'd for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng'd on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold! Exit",

No,\n    he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of\n    my substance; if he take her, let him take her simply; the\n    wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes\n    not that way.\n  FORD. I beseech you, heartily, some of you go home with me\n    to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have sport; I will\n    show you a monster. Master Doctor, you shall go; so shall\n    you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.\n  SHALLOW. Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer\n    wooing at Master Page's. Exeunt SHALLOW and SLENDER\n  CAIUS. Go home, John Rugby; I come anon. Exit RUGBY\n  HOST. Farewell, my hearts; I will to my honest knight\n    Falstaff, and drink canary with him. Exit HOST\n  FORD.

What, Robin, I say!\nEnter SERVANTS with a basket\n\n  MRS. PAGE. Come, come, come.\n  MRS. FORD. Here, set it down.\n  MRS. PAGE. Give your men the charge; we must be brief.\n  MRS. FORD. Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be\n    ready here hard by in the brew-house; and when I suddenly\n    call you, come forth, and, without any pause or\n    staggering, take this basket on your shoulders. That done,\n    trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters\n    in Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch\n    close by the Thames side.\n  Mrs. PAGE. You will do it?\n  MRS. FORD. I ha' told them over and over; they lack no\n    direction. Be gone, and come when you are call'd.\n                                               Exeunt SERVANTS\n  MRS. PAGE. Here comes little Robin.\nEnter ROBIN\n\n  MRS. FORD. How now, my eyas-musket, what news with\n    you?\n  ROBIN. My Master Sir John is come in at your back-door,\n    Mistress Ford, and requests your company.\n  MRS. PAGE. You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?\n  ROBIN. Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your\n    being here, and hath threat'ned to put me into everlasting\n    liberty, if I tell you of it; for he swears he'll turn me\naway.\n  MRS. PAGE. Thou 'rt a good boy; this secrecy of thine shall\n    be a tailor to thee, and shall make thee a new doublet and\n    hose. I'll go hide me.\n  MRS. FORD. Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone. [Exit\n  ROBIN] Mistress Page, remember you your cue.\n  MRS. PAGE. I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.\n                                                Exit MRS. PAGE\n  MRS. FORD.

Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?\n    Why, now let me die, for I have liv'd long enough; this is\n    the period of my ambition. O this blessed hour!\n  MRS. FORD. O sweet Sir John!\n  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,\n    Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish; I would thy\n    husband were dead; I'll speak it before the best lord, I\n    would make thee my lady.\n  MRS. FORD. I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful\n    lady.\n  FALSTAFF. Let the court of France show me such another. I\n    see how thine eye would emulate the diamond; thou hast\n    the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the\n    ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian\nadmittance.\n  MRS. FORD. A plain kerchief, Sir John; my brows become\n    nothing else, nor that well neither.\n  FALSTAFF. By the Lord, thou art a tyrant to say so; thou\n    wouldst make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of\n    thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a\n    semi-circled farthingale. I see what thou wert, if Fortune\n    thy foe were, not Nature, thy friend. Come, thou canst not\n    hide it.\n  MRS. FORD. Believe me, there's no such thing in me.\n  FALSTAFF. What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee\n    there's something extra-ordinary in thee. Come, I cannot\n    cog, and say thou art this and that, like a many of these\n    lisping hawthorn-buds that come like women in men's\n    apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time; I\n    cannot; but I love thee, none but thee; and thou deserv'st\nit.\n  MRS. FORD. Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress\n    Page.\n  FALSTAFF. Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the\n    Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a\n    lime-kiln.\n  MRS. FORD. Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you\n    shall one day find it.\n  FALSTAFF. Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.\n  MRS. FORD. Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could\n    not be in that mind.\n  ROBIN. [Within] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's\n    Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking\n    wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.\n  FALSTAFF. She shall not see me; I will ensconce me behind\n    the arras.\n  MRS. FORD. Pray you, do so; she's a very tattling woman.\n                                      [FALSTAFF hides himself]\nRe-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN\n\n    What's the matter? How now!\n  MRS. PAGE. O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're\n    sham'd, y'are overthrown, y'are undone for ever.\n  MRS. FORD. What's the matter, good Mistress Page?\n  MRS. PAGE. O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest\n    man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!\n  MRS. FORD. What cause of suspicion?\n  MRS. PAGE. What cause of suspicion? Out upon you, how\n    am I mistook in you!\n  MRS. FORD. Why, alas, what's the matter?\n  MRS. PAGE. Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all\n    the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he\n    says is here now in the house, by your consent, to take an\n    ill advantage of his absence. You are undone.\n  MRS. FORD. 'Tis not so, I hope.\n  MRS. PAGE. Pray heaven it be not so that you have such a\n    man here; but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,\n    with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a one. I\n    come before to tell you. If you know yourself clear, why,\n    I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey,\n    convey him out. Be not amaz'd; call all your senses to you;\n    defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life\n    for ever.\n  MRS. FORD. What shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear\n    friend; and I fear not mine own shame as much as his peril.\n    I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the\n    house.\n  MRS. PAGE. For shame, never stand 'you had rather' and 'you\n    had rather'! Your husband's here at hand; bethink you of\n    some conveyance; in the house you cannot hide him. O,\n    how have you deceiv'd me! Look, here is a basket; if he be\n    of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and throw\n    foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking, or-it is\n    whiting-time-send him by your two men to Datchet\n    Mead.\n  MRS. FORD. He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?\n  FALSTAFF. [Coming forward] Let me see 't, let me see 't. O,\n    let me see 't! I'll in, I'll in; follow your friend's\ncounsel;\n    I'll in.\n  MRS. PAGE. What, Sir John Falstaff! [Aside to FALSTAFF]\n    Are these your letters, knight?\n  FALSTAFF. [Aside to MRS. PAGE] I love thee and none but\n    thee; help me away.-Let me creep in here; I'll never-\n    [Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen]\n  MRS. PAGE. Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,\n    Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!\n  MRS. FORD. What, John! Robert! John! Exit ROBIN\nRe-enter SERVANTS\n\nGo, take up these clothes here, quickly; where's the cowl-staff? Look how you drumble. Carry them to the laundress in Datchet Mead; quickly, come.\n\nEnter FORD, PAGE, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n\n  FORD. Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why\n    then make sport at me, then let me be your jest; I deserve\n    it. How now, whither bear you this?\n  SERVANT. To the laundress, forsooth.\n  MRS. FORD. Why, what have you to do whither they bear it?\n    You were best meddle with buck-washing.\n  FORD. Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck!\n    Buck, buck, buck! ay, buck! I warrant you, buck; and of\n    the season too, it shall appear. [Exeunt SERVANTS with\n    basket] Gentlemen, I have dream'd to-night; I'll tell you my\n    dream. Here, here, here be my keys; ascend my chambers,\n    search, seek, find out. I'll warrant we'll unkennel the fox.\n    Let me stop this way first. [Locking the door] So, now\n    uncape.\n  PAGE. Good Master Ford, be contented; you wrong yourself\n    too much.\n  FORD. True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport\n    anon; follow me, gentlemen. Exit\n  EVANS. This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.\n  CAIUS. By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous\n    in France.\n  PAGE. Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his\n    search. Exeunt EVANS, PAGE, and CAIUS\n  MRS. PAGE. Is there not a double excellency in this?\n  MRS. FORD. I know not which pleases me better, that my\n    husband is deceived, or Sir John.\n  MRS. PAGE. What a taking was he in when your husband\n    ask'd who was in the basket!\n  MRS. FORD. I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so\n    throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.\n  MRS. PAGE. Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the\n    same strain were in the same distress.\n  MRS. FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion\n    of Falstaff's being here, for I never saw him so gross in his\n    jealousy till now.\n  MRS. PAGE. I Will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have\n    more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce\n    obey this medicine.\n  MRS. FORD. Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress\n    Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water,\n    and give him another hope, to betray him to another\n    punishment?\n  MRS. PAGE. We will do it; let him be sent for to-morrow\n    eight o'clock, to have amends.\nRe-enter FORD, PAGE, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n\n  FORD. I cannot find him; may be the knave bragg'd of that\n    he could not compass.\n  MRS. PAGE. [Aside to MRS. FORD] Heard you that?\n  MRS. FORD. You use me well, Master Ford, do you?\n  FORD. Ay, I do so.\n  MRS. FORD. Heaven make you better than your thoughts!\n  FORD. Amen.\n  MRS. PAGE. You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.\n  FORD. Ay, ay; I must bear it.\n  EVANS. If there be any pody in the house, and in the\n    chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses, heaven\nforgive\n    my sins at the day of judgment!\n  CAIUS. Be gar, nor I too; there is no bodies.\n  PAGE. Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not asham'd? What\n    spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I would not ha'\n    your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor\n    Castle.\n  FORD. 'Tis my fault, Master Page; I suffer for it.\n  EVANS. You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as\n    honest a omans as I will desires among five thousand, and\nfive\n    hundred too.\n  CAIUS. By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.\n  FORD. Well, I promis'd you a dinner. Come, come, walk in\n    the Park. I pray you pardon me; I will hereafter make\n    known to you why I have done this. Come, wife, come,\n    Mistress Page; I pray you pardon me; pray heartly,\n    pardon me.\n  PAGE. Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock him.\n    I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house to breakfast;\n    after, we'll a-birding together; I have a fine hawk for\n    the bush. Shall it be so?\n  FORD. Any thing.\n  EVANS. If there is one, I shall make two in the company.\n  CAIUS. If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.\n  FORD. Pray you go, Master Page.\n  EVANS. I pray you now, remembrance to-morrow on the\n    lousy knave, mine host.\n  CAIUS. Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart.\n  EVANS. A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!\n                                                          Exeunt",

No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!\n    Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth\n    Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne;\n    Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value\n    Than stamps in gold, or sums in sealed bags;\n    And 'tis the very riches of thyself\n    That now I aim at.\n  ANNE.

A buck-basket!\n  FALSTAFF. By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ramm'd me in with\n    foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy\n    napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound\n    of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.\n  FORD. And how long lay you there?\n  FALSTAFF. Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have\n    suffer'd to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being\n    thus cramm'd in the basket, a couple of Ford's knaves, his\n    hinds, were call'd forth by their mistress to carry me in\n    the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane; they took me on\n    their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the\n    door; who ask'd them once or twice what they had in their\n    basket. I quak'd for fear lest the lunatic knave would have\n    search'd it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold,\n    held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away\n    went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master\n    Brook-I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first,\n    an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten\n    bell-wether; next, to be compass'd like a good bilbo in the\n    circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and\n    then, to be stopp'd in, like a strong distillation, with\n    stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of\nthat\n    -a man of my kidney. Think of that-that am as subject to\n    heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It\n    was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of\n    this bath, when I was more than half-stew'd in grease, like\n    a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames, and cool'd,\n    glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that\n    -hissing hot. Think of that, Master Brook.\n  FORD. In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you\n    have suffer'd all this. My suit, then, is desperate;\n    you'll undertake her no more.\n  FALSTAFF. Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I\n    have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her\n    husband is this morning gone a-birding; I have received from\n    her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt eight and nine is\n    the hour, Master Brook.\n  FORD. 'Tis past eight already, sir.\n  FALSTAFF. Is it? I Will then address me to my appointment.\n    Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall\n    know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crowned\n    with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall have her, Master\n    Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford. Exit\n  FORD. Hum! ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep?\n    Master Ford, awake; awake, Master Ford. There's a hole\n    made in your best coat, Master Ford. This 'tis to be\n    married; this 'tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I\nwill\n    proclaim myself what I am; I will now take the lecher; he\n    is at my house. He cannot scape me; 'tis impossible he\n    should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse nor into\n    a pepper box. But, lest the devil that guides him should aid\n    him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I\n    cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make\n    me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb\n    go with me-I'll be horn mad. Exit",

    "content":"SCENE 2.\nFORD'S house\n\nEnter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD\n\n  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my\n    sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love, and I\n    profess requital to a hair's breadth; not only, Mistress\nFord, in\n    the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement,\n    complement, and ceremony of it. But are you sure of your\n    husband now?\n  MRS. FORD. He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.\n  MRS. PAGE. [Within] What hoa, gossip Ford, what hoa!\n  MRS. FORD. Step into th' chamber, Sir John. Exit FALSTAFF\nEnter MISTRESS PAGE\n\n  MRS. PAGE. How now, sweetheart, who's at home besides\n    yourself?\n  MRS. FORD. Why, none but mine own people.\n  MRS. PAGE. Indeed?\n  MRS. FORD. No, certainly. [Aside to her] Speak louder.\n  MRS. PAGE. Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.\n  MRS. FORD. Why?\n  MRS. PAGE. Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes\n    again. He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails\n    against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's daughters,\n    of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself on the\n    forehead, crying 'Peer-out, peer-out!' that any madness I\n    ever yet beheld seem'd but tameness, civility, and patience,\n    to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight\n    is not here.\n  MRS. FORD. Why, does he talk of him?\n  MRS. PAGE. Of none but him; and swears he was carried out,\n    the last time he search'd for him, in a basket; protests to\n    my husband he is now here; and hath drawn him and the\n    rest of their company from their sport, to make another\n    experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not\n    here; now he shall see his own foolery.\n  MRS. FORD. How near is he, Mistress Page?\n  MRS. PAGE. Hard by, at street end; he will be here anon.\n  MRS. FORD. I am undone: the knight is here.\n  MRS. PAGE. Why, then, you are utterly sham'd, and he's but\n    a dead man. What a woman are you! Away with him,\n    away with him; better shame than murder.\n  MRS. FORD. Which way should he go? How should I bestow\n    him? Shall I put him into the basket again?\nRe-enter FALSTAFF\n\n  FALSTAFF. No, I'll come no more i' th' basket. May I not go\n    out ere he come?\n  MRS. PAGE. Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the\n    door with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise you\n    might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?\n  FALSTAFF. What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.\n  MRS. FORD. There they always use to discharge their\n    birding-pieces.\n  MRS. PAGE. Creep into the kiln-hole.\n  FALSTAFF. Where is it?\n  MRS. FORD. He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,\n    coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract\nfor\n    the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his\n    note. There is no hiding you in the house.\n  FALSTAFF. I'll go out then.\n  MRS. PAGE. If you go out in your own semblance, you die,\n    Sir John. Unless you go out disguis'd.\n  MRS. FORD. How might we disguise him?\n  MRS. PAGE. Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's\n    gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a\n    hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so escape.\n  FALSTAFF. Good hearts, devise something; any extremity\n    rather than a mischief.\n  MRS. FORD. My Maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brainford, has\n    a gown above.\n  MRS. PAGE. On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he\n    is; and there's her thrumm'd hat, and her muffler too. Run\n    up, Sir John.\n  MRS. FORD. Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will\n    look some linen for your head.\n  MRS. PAGE. Quick, quick; we'll come dress you straight. Put\n    on the gown the while. Exit FALSTAFF\n  MRS. FORD. I would my husband would meet him in this\n    shape; he cannot abide the old woman of Brainford; he\n    swears she's a witch, forbade her my house, and hath\n    threat'ned to beat her.\n  MRS. PAGE. Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel; and\n    the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!\n  MRS. FORD. But is my husband coming?\n  MRS. PAGE. Ay, in good sadness is he; and talks of the basket\n    too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.\n  MRS. FORD. We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry\n    the basket again, to meet him at the door with it as they\n    did last time.\n  MRS. PAGE. Nay, but he'll be here presently; let's go dress\n    him like the witch of Brainford.\n  MRS. FORD. I'll first direct my men what they shall do with\n    the basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight. Exit\n  MRS. PAGE. Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse\n    him enough.\n    We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,\n    Wives may be merry and yet honest too.\n    We do not act that often jest and laugh;\n    'Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff. Exit\nRe-enter MISTRESS FORD, with two SERVANTS\n\n  MRS. FORD. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders;\n    your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it down, obey\n    him; quickly, dispatch. Exit\n  FIRST SERVANT. Come, come, take it up.\n  SECOND SERVANT. Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.\n  FIRST SERVANT. I hope not; I had lief as bear so much lead.\nEnter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n\n  FORD. Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any\n    way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket, villain!\n    Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket! O you panderly\n    rascals, there's a knot, a ging, a pack, a conspiracy\n    against me. Now shall the devil be sham'd. What, wife, I\n    say! Come, come forth; behold what honest clothes you\n    send forth to bleaching.\n  PAGE. Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose\n    any longer; you must be pinion'd.\n  EVANS. Why, this is lunatics. This is mad as a mad dog.\n  SHALLOW. Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.\n  FORD. So say I too, sir.\nRe-enter MISTRESS FORD\n\n    Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford, the honest\n    woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath\n    the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect without cause,\n    Mistress, do I?\n  MRS. FORD. Heaven be my witness, you do, if you suspect\n    me in any dishonesty.\n  FORD. Well said, brazen-face; hold it out. Come forth, sirrah.\n                           [Pulling clothes out of the basket]\n  PAGE. This passes!\n  MRS. FORD. Are you not asham'd? Let the clothes alone.\n  FORD. I shall find you anon.\n  EVANS. 'Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife's\n    clothes? Come away.\n  FORD. Empty the basket, I say.\n  MRS. FORD. Why, man, why?\n  FORD. Master Page, as I am a man, there was one convey'd\n    out of my house yesterday in this basket. Why may not\n    he be there again? In my house I am sure he is; my\n    intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.\n    Pluck me out all the linen.\n  MRS. FORD. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's\n    death.\n  PAGE. Here's no man.\n  SHALLOW. By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this\n    wrongs you.\n  EVANS. Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the\n    imaginations of your own heart; this is jealousies.\n  FORD. Well, he's not here I seek for.\n  PAGE. No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.\n  FORD. Help to search my house this one time. If I find not\n    what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let me for\n    ever be your table sport; let them say of me 'As jealous as\n    Ford, that search'd a hollow walnut for his wife's leman.'\n    Satisfy me once more; once more search with me.\n  MRS. FORD. What, hoa, Mistress Page! Come you and the old\n    woman down; my husband will come into the chamber.\n  FORD. Old woman? what old woman's that?\n  MRS. FORD. Why, it is my maid's aunt of Brainford.\n  FORD. A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not\n    forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does she? We\n    are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pass\n    under the profession of fortune-telling. She works by\n    charms, by spells, by th' figure, and such daub'ry as this\n    is, beyond our element. We know nothing. Come down, you\n    witch, you hag you; come down, I say.\n  MRS. FORD. Nay, good sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let\n    him not strike the old woman.\nRe-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and MISTRESS PAGE\n\n  MRS. PAGE. Come, Mother Prat; come. give me your hand.\n  FORD. I'll prat her. [Beating him] Out of my door, you\n    witch, you hag, you. baggage, you polecat, you ronyon!\n    Out, out! I'll conjure you, I'll fortune-tell you.\n                                                   Exit FALSTAFF\n  MRS. PAGE. Are you not asham'd? I think you have kill'd the\n    poor woman.\n  MRS. FORD. Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.\n  FORD. Hang her, witch!\n  EVANS. By yea and no, I think the oman is a witch indeed; I\n    like not when a oman has a great peard; I spy a great peard\n    under his muffler.\n  FORD. Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you follow;\n    see but the issue of my jealousy; if I cry out thus upon no\n    trail, never trust me when I open again.\n  PAGE. Let's obey his humour a little further. Come,\n    gentlemen. Exeunt all but MRS. FORD and MRS. PAGE\n  MRS. PAGE. Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.\n  MRS. FORD. Nay, by th' mass, that he did not; he beat him\n    most unpitifully methought.\n  MRS. PAGE. I'll have the cudgel hallow'd and hung o'er the\n    altar; it hath done meritorious service.\n  MRS. FORD. What think you? May we, with the warrant of\n    womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue\n    him with any further revenge?\n  MRS. PAGE. The spirit of wantonness is sure scar'd out of\n    him; if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with fine and\n    recovery, he will never, I think, in the way of waste,\n    attempt us again.\n  MRS. FORD. Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd\n    him?\n  MRS. PAGE. Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the\n    figures out of your husband's brains. If they can find in\ntheir\n    hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further\n    afflicted, we two will still be the ministers.\n  MRS. FORD. I'll warrant they'll have him publicly sham'd;\n    and methinks there would be no period to the jest, should\n    he not be publicly sham'd.\n  MRS. PAGE. Come, to the forge with it then; shape it. I\n    would not have things cool. Exeunt",

And did he send you both these letters at an instant?\n  MRS. PAGE. Within a quarter of an hour.\n  FORD. Pardon me, wife. Henceforth, do what thou wilt;\n    I rather will suspect the sun with cold\n    Than thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honour stand,\n    In him that was of late an heretic,\n    As firm as faith.\n  PAGE. 'Tis well, 'tis well; no more.\n    Be not as extreme in submission as in offence;\n    But let our plot go forward. Let our wives\n    Yet once again, to make us public sport,\n    Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,\n    Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.\n  FORD. There is no better way than that they spoke of.\n  PAGE. How? To send him word they'll meet him in the Park\n    at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come!\n  EVANS. You say he has been thrown in the rivers; and has\n    been grievously peaten as an old oman; methinks there\n    should be terrors in him, that he should not come;\n    methinks his flesh is punish'd; he shall have no desires.\n  PAGE. So think I too.\n  MRS. FORD. Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,\n    And let us two devise to bring him thither.\n  MRS. PAGE. There is an old tale goes that Herne the Hunter,\n    Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,\n    Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,\n    Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;\n    And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,\n    And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain\n    In a most hideous and dreadful manner.\n    You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know\n    The superstitious idle-headed eld\n    Receiv'd, and did deliver to our age,\n    This tale of Herne the Hunter for a truth.\n  PAGE. Why yet there want not many that do fear\n    In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak.\n    But what of this?\n  MRS. FORD. Marry, this is our device-\n    That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,\n    Disguis'd, like Herme, with huge horns on his head.\n  PAGE. Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come,\n    And in this shape. When you have brought him thither,\n    What shall be done with him? What is your plot?\n  MRS. PAGE. That likewise have we thought upon, and\n    thus:\n    Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,\n    And three or four more of their growth, we'll dress\n    Like urchins, ouphes, and fairies, green and white,\n    With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,\n    And rattles in their hands; upon a sudden,\n    As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met,\n    Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once\n    With some diffused song; upon their sight\n    We two in great amazedness will fly.\n    Then let them all encircle him about,\n    And fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight;\n    And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,\n    In their so sacred paths he dares to tread\n    In shape profane.\n  MRS. FORD. And till he tell the truth,\n    Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound,\n    And burn him with their tapers.\n  MRS. PAGE. The truth being known,\n    We'll all present ourselves; dis-horn the spirit,\n    And mock him home to Windsor.\n  FORD. The children must\n    Be practis'd well to this or they'll nev'r do 't.\n  EVANS. I will teach the children their behaviours; and I will\n    be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my\n    taber.\n  FORD. That will be excellent. I'll go buy them vizards.\n  MRS. PAGE. My Nan shall be the Queen of all the Fairies,\n    Finely attired in a robe of white.\n  PAGE. That silk will I go buy.

Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff\n    from Master Slender.\n  HOST. There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his\n    standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about with the\n    story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go, knock and call;\nhe'll\n    speak like an Anthropophaginian unto thee. Knock, I say.\n  SIMPLE. There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into\n    his chamber; I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come\ndown;\n    I come to speak with her, indeed.\n  HOST. Ha! a fat woman? The knight may be robb'd. I'll call.\n    Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Speak from thy lungs\n    military. Art thou there? It is thine host, thine Ephesian,\ncalls.\n  FALSTAFF. [Above] How now, mine host?\n  HOST. Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of\n    thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her descend;\n    my chambers are honourible. Fie, privacy, fie!\nEnter FALSTAFF\n\n  FALSTAFF. There was, mine host, an old fat woman even\n    now with, me; but she's gone.\n  SIMPLE. Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of\n    Brainford?\n  FALSTAFF. Ay, marry was it, mussel-shell. What would you\n    with her?\n  SIMPLE. My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her,\n    seeing her go thorough the streets, to know, sir, whether one\n    Nym, sir, that beguil'd him of a chain, had the chain or no.\n  FALSTAFF. I spake with the old woman about it.\n  SIMPLE. And what says she, I pray, sir?\n  FALSTAFF Marry, she says that the very same man that\n    beguil'd Master Slender of his chain cozen'd him of it.\n  SIMPLE. I would I could have spoken with the woman\n    herself; I had other things to have spoken with her too,\n    from him.\n  FALSTAFF. What are they? Let us know.\n  HOST. Ay, come; quick.\n  SIMPLE. I may not conceal them, sir.\n  FALSTAFF. Conceal them, or thou diest.\n    SIMPLE.. Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress\n    Anne Page: to know if it were my master's fortune to\n    have her or no.\n  FALSTAFF. 'Tis, 'tis his fortune.\n  SIMPLE. What sir?\n  FALSTAFF. To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me\n    so.\n  SIMPLE. May I be bold to say so, sir?\n  FALSTAFF. Ay, sir, like who more bold?\n  SIMPLE., I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad\n    with these tidings. Exit SIMPLE\n  HOST. Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was\n    there a wise woman with thee?\n  FALSTAFF. Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath\n    taught me more wit than ever I learn'd before in my life;\n    and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for my\n    learning.\nEnter BARDOLPH\n\n  BARDOLPH. Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage!\n  HOST. Where be my horses? Speak well of them, varletto.\n  BARDOLPH. Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I\n    came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of\n    them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like\n    three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.\n  HOST. They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain; do not\n    say they be fled. Germans are honest men.\nEnter SIR HUGH EVANS\n\n  EVANS. Where is mine host?\n  HOST. What is the matter, sir?\n  EVANS. Have a care of your entertainments. There is a friend\n    of mine come to town tells me there is three\n    cozen-germans that has cozen'd all the hosts of Readins,\n    of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money. I tell you\nfor\n    good will, look you; you are wise, and full of gibes and\n    vlouting-stogs, and 'tis not convenient you should be\n    cozened. Fare you well. Exit\nEnter DOCTOR CAIUS\n\n  CAIUS. Vere is mine host de Jarteer?\n  HOST. Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful\n    dilemma.\n  CAIUS. I cannot tell vat is dat; but it is tell-a me dat you\n    make grand preparation for a Duke de Jamany. By my\n    trot, dere is no duke that the court is know to come; I\n    tell you for good will. Adieu. Exit\n  HOST. Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight; I am\n    undone. Fly, run, hue and cry, villain; I am undone.\n                                        Exeunt HOST and BARDOLPH\n  FALSTAFF. I would all the world might be cozen'd, for I have\n    been cozen'd and beaten too. If it should come to the ear\n    of the court how I have been transformed, and how my\n    transformation hath been wash'd and cudgell'd, they\n    would melt me out of my fat, drop by drop, and liquor\n    fishermen's boots with me; I warrant they would whip me\n    with their fine wits till I were as crestfall'n as a dried\npear.\n    I never prosper'd since I forswore myself at primero. Well,\n    if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers,\n    would repent.\nEnter MISTRESS QUICKLY\n\n    Now! whence come you?\n  QUICKLY. From the two parties, forsooth.\n  FALSTAFF. The devil take one party and his dam the other!\n    And so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffer'd more\n    for their sakes, more than the villainous inconstancy of\n    man's disposition is able to bear.\n  QUICKLY. And have not they suffer'd? Yes, I warrant;\n    speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten\n    black and blue, that you cannot see a white spot about her.\n  FALSTAFF. What tell'st thou me of black and blue? I was\n    beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow; and\n    was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brainford. But\n    that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the\n    action of an old woman, deliver'd me, the knave constable\n    had set me i' th' stocks, i' th' common stocks, for a witch.\n  QUICKLY. Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber; you\n    shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your content.\n    Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good hearts, what ado\n    here is to bring you together! Sure, one of you does not\n    serve heaven well, that you are so cross'd.\n  FALSTAFF. Come up into my chamber. Exeunt",

To this her mother's plot\n    She seemingly obedient likewise hath\n    Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests:\n    Her father means she shall be all in white;\n    And in that habit, when Slender sees his time\n    To take her by the hand and bid her go,\n    She shall go with him; her mother hath intended\n    The better to denote her to the doctor-\n    For they must all be mask'd and vizarded-\n    That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob'd,\n    With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;\n    And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,\n    To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,\n    The maid hath given consent to go with him.\n  HOST. Which means she to deceive, father or mother?\n  FENTON. Both, my good host, to go along with me.\n    And here it rests-that you'll procure the vicar\n    To stay for me at church, 'twixt twelve and one,\n    And in the lawful name of marrying,\n    To give our hearts united ceremony.\n  HOST. Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar.\n    Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.\n  FENTON. So shall I evermore be bound to thee;\n    Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

I was three or four\n    times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the\n    guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers,\n    drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv'd belief,\n    in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they\n    were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent\n    when 'tis upon ill employment.\n  EVANS. Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires,\n    and fairies will not pinse you.\n  FORD.

Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that\n    it wants matter to prevent so gross, o'er-reaching as this?\n    Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a cox-comb\n    of frieze? 'Tis time I were chok'd with a piece of\n    toasted cheese.\n  EVANS. Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all\n    putter.\n  FALSTAFF. 'Seese' and 'putter'! Have I liv'd to stand at the\n    taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough\n    to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.\n  MRS. PAGE. Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would\n    have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and\n    shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,\n    that ever the devil could have made you our delight?\n  FORD. What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?\n  MRS. PAGE. A puff'd man?\n  PAGE. Old, cold, wither'd, and of intolerable entrails?\n  FORD. And one that is as slanderous as Satan?\n  PAGE. And as poor as Job?\n  FORD. And as wicked as his wife?\n  EVANS. And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack,\n    and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings, and swearings,\n    and starings, pribbles and prabbles?\n  FALSTAFF. Well, I am your theme; you have the start of me;\n    I am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel;\n    ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me; use me as you will.\n  FORD. Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one Master\n    Brook, that you have cozen'd of money, to whom you\n    should have been a pander. Over and above that you have\n    suffer'd, I think to repay that money will be a biting\n    affliction.\n  PAGE. Yet be cheerful, knight; thou shalt eat a posset\n    tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my\n    wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath\n    married her daughter.\n  MRS. PAGE. [Aside] Doctors doubt that; if Anne Page be\n    my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.\nEnter SLENDER\n\n  SLENDER. Whoa, ho, ho, father Page!\n  PAGE. Son, how now! how now, son! Have you dispatch'd'?\n  SLENDER. Dispatch'd! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire\n    know on't; would I were hang'd, la, else!\n  PAGE. Of what, son?\n  SLENDER. I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne\n    Page, and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i'\n    th' church, I would have swing'd him, or he should have\n    swing'd me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page,\n    would I might never stir!-and 'tis a postmaster's boy.\n  PAGE. Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.\n  SLENDER. What need you tell me that? I think so, when I\n    took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all\n    he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had him.\n  PAGE. Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how\n    you should know my daughter by her garments?\n  SLENDER. I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she\n    cried 'budget' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was\n    not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.\n  MRS. PAGE. Good George, be not angry. I knew of your\n    purpose; turn'd my daughter into green; and, indeed, she\n    is now with the Doctor at the dean'ry, and there married.\nEnter CAIUS\n\n  CAIUS. Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened; I ha'\n    married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is\n    not Anne Page; by gar, I am cozened.\n  MRS. PAGE. Why, did you take her in green?\n  CAIUS. Ay, be gar, and 'tis a boy; be gar, I'll raise all\n    Windsor. Exit CAIUS\n  FORD. This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?\n  PAGE. My heart misgives me; here comes Master Fenton.\nEnter FENTON and ANNE PAGE\n\n    How now, Master Fenton!\n  ANNE. Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.\n  PAGE. Now, Mistress, how chance you went not with Master\n    Slender?\n  MRS. PAGE. Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?\n  FENTON. You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.\n    You would have married her most shamefully,\n    Where there was no proportion held in love.\n    The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,\n    Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.\n    Th' offence is holy that she hath committed;\n    And this deceit loses the name of craft,\n    Of disobedience, or unduteous title,\n    Since therein she doth evitate and shun\n    A thousand irreligious cursed hours,\n    Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.\n  FORD. Stand not amaz'd; here is no remedy.\n    In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state;\n    Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.\n  FALSTAFF. I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand\n    to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanc'd.\n  PAGE. Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!\n    What cannot be eschew'd must be embrac'd.\n  FALSTAFF. When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chas'd.\n  MRS. PAGE. Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,\n    Heaven give you many, many merry days!\n    Good husband, let us every one go home,\n    And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;\n    Sir John and all.\n  FORD. Let it be so. Sir John,\n    To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word;\n    For he, to-night, shall lie with Mistress Ford. Exeunt\nTHE END",
