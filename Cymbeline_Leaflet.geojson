    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline’s palace.\nEnter two Gentlemen.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nYou do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods\nNo more obey the heavens than our courtiers\nStill seem as does the King’s.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nBut what’s the matter?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHis daughter, and the heir of’s kingdom, whom\nHe purpos’d to his wife’s sole son—a widow\nThat late he married—hath referr’d herself\nUnto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded;\nHer husband banish’d; she imprison’d. All\nIs outward sorrow, though I think the King\nBe touch’d at very heart.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nNone but the King?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHe that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,\nThat most desir’d the match. But not a courtier,\nAlthough they wear their faces to the bent\nOf the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not\nGlad at the thing they scowl at.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nAnd why so?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHe that hath miss’d the Princess is a thing\nToo bad for bad report; and he that hath her—\nI mean that married her, alack, good man!\nAnd therefore banish’d—is a creature such\nAs, to seek through the regions of the earth\nFor one his like, there would be something failing\nIn him that should compare. I do not think\nSo fair an outward and such stuff within\nEndows a man but he.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nYou speak him far.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI do extend him, sir, within himself;\nCrush him together rather than unfold\nHis measure duly.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nWhat’s his name and birth?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nI cannot delve him to the root; his father\nWas call’d Sicilius, who did join his honour\nAgainst the Romans with Cassibelan,\nBut had his titles by Tenantius, whom\nHe serv’d with glory and admir’d success,\nSo gain’d the sur-addition Leonatus;\nAnd had, besides this gentleman in question,\nTwo other sons, who, in the wars o’ th’ time,\nDied with their swords in hand; for which their father,\nThen old and fond of issue, took such sorrow\nThat he quit being; and his gentle lady,\nBig of this gentleman, our theme, deceas’d\nAs he was born. The King he takes the babe\nTo his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,\nBreeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,\nPuts to him all the learnings that his time\nCould make him the receiver of; which he took,\nAs we do air, fast as ’twas minist’red,\nAnd in’s spring became a harvest, liv’d in court—\nWhich rare it is to do—most prais’d, most lov’d,\nA sample to the youngest; to th’ more mature\nA glass that feated them; and to the graver\nA child that guided dotards. To his mistress,\nFor whom he now is banish’d, her own price\nProclaims how she esteem’d him and his virtue;\nBy her election may be truly read\nWhat kind of man he is.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nI honour him\nEven out of your report. But pray you tell me,\nIs she sole child to th’ King?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHis only child.\nHe had two sons—if this be worth your hearing,\nMark it—the eldest of them at three years old,\nI’ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery\nWere stol’n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge\nWhich way they went.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nHow long is this ago?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nSome twenty years.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nThat a king’s children should be so convey’d,\nSo slackly guarded, and the search so slow\nThat could not trace them!\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nHowsoe’er ’tis strange,\nOr that the negligence may well be laugh’d at,\nYet is it true, sir.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\nI do well believe you.\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\nWe must forbear; here comes the gentleman,\nThe Queen, and Princess.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Another?\nYou gentle gods, give me but this I have,\nAnd sear up my embracements from a next\nWith bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here\n\n[Puts on the ring.]\n\nWhile sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,\nAs I my poor self did exchange for you,\nTo your so infinite loss, so in our trifles\nI still win of you.

    "content":"SCENE V. Rome. Philario’s house.\nEnter Philario, Iachimo, a Frenchman, a Dutchman and a Spaniard.\n\nIACHIMO.\nBelieve it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of. But I could then have look’d on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by items.\n\nPHILARIO.\nYou speak of him when he was less furnish’d than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nI have seen him in France; we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThis matter of marrying his king’s daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nAnd then his banishment.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAy, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgement, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?\n\nPHILARIO.\nHis father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life.\n\nEnter Posthumus.\n\nHere comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nSir, we have known together in Orleans.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSince when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nSir, you o’errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nBy your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller; rather shunn’d to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others’ experiences; but upon my mended judgement (if I offend not to say it is mended) my quarrel was not altogether slight.\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nFaith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall’n both.\n\nIACHIMO.\nCan we, with manners, ask what was the difference?\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nSafely, I think. ’Twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching (and upon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThat lady is not now living, or this gentleman’s opinion, by this, worn out.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nShe holds her virtue still, and I my mind.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYou must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of Italy.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nBeing so far provok’d as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAs fair and as good—a kind of hand-in-hand comparison—had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain. If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excelled many; but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI prais’d her as I rated her. So do I my stone.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWhat do you esteem it at?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nMore than the world enjoys.\n\nIACHIMO.\nEither your unparagon’d mistress is dead, or she’s outpriz’d by a trifle.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYou are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWhich the gods have given you?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nWhich by their graces I will keep.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYou may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol’n too. So your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish’d courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYour Italy contains none so accomplish’d a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.\n\nPHILARIO.\nLet us leave here, gentlemen.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWith five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNo, no.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring, which, in my opinion, o’ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and, to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYou are a great deal abus’d in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what y’are worthy of by your attempt.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWhat’s that?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nA repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more; a punishment too.\n\nPHILARIO.\nGentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWould I had put my estate and my neighbour’s on th’ approbation of what I have spoke!\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nWhat lady would you choose to assail?\n\nIACHIMO.\nYours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv’d.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger; ’tis part of it.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYou are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies’ flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what’s spoken, I swear.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nWill you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between’s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here’s my ring.\n\nPHILARIO.\nI will have it no lay.\n\nIACHIMO.\nBy the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy’d the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours: provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail’d, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate; if she remain unseduc’d, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th’ assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYour hand, a covenant! We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nAgreed.\n\n[Exeunt Posthumus and Iachimo.]\n\nFRENCHMAN.\nWill this hold, think you?\n\nPHILARIO.\nSignior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow ’em.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

He’s for his master,\nAn enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!\nDoctor, your service for this time is ended;\nTake your own way.\n\nCORNELIUS.\n[Aside.] I do suspect you, madam;\nBut you shall do no harm.\n\nQUEEN.\n[To Pisanio.] Hark thee, a word.\n\nCORNELIUS.\n[Aside.] I do not like her. She doth think she has\nStrange ling’ring poisons. I do know her spirit,\nAnd will not trust one of her malice with\nA drug of such damn’d nature. Those she has\nWill stupefy and dull the sense awhile,\nWhich first perchance she’ll prove on cats and dogs,\nThen afterward up higher; but there is\nNo danger in what show of death it makes,\nMore than the locking up the spirits a time,\nTo be more fresh, reviving. She is fool’d\nWith a most false effect; and I the truer\nSo to be false with her.\n\nQUEEN.\nNo further service, Doctor,\nUntil I send for thee.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nI humbly take my leave.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nQUEEN.\nWeeps she still, say’st thou? Dost thou think in time\nShe will not quench, and let instructions enter\nWhere folly now possesses? Do thou work.\nWhen thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,\nI’ll tell thee on the instant thou art then\nAs great as is thy master; greater, for\nHis fortunes all lie speechless, and his name\nIs at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor\nContinue where he is. To shift his being\nIs to exchange one misery with another,\nAnd every day that comes comes to decay\nA day’s work in him. What shalt thou expect\nTo be depender on a thing that leans,\nWho cannot be new built, nor has no friends\nSo much as but to prop him?\n\n[The Queen drops the box. Pisanio takes it up.]\n\nThou tak’st up\nThou know’st not what; but take it for thy labour.\nIt is a thing I made, which hath the King\nFive times redeem’d from death. I do not know\nWhat is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;\nIt is an earnest of a further good\nThat I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how\nThe case stands with her; do’t as from thyself.\nThink what a chance thou changest on; but think\nThou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,\nWho shall take notice of thee. I’ll move the King\nTo any shape of thy preferment, such\nAs thou’lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,\nThat set thee on to this desert, am bound\nTo load thy merit richly. Call my women.\nThink on my words.\n\n[Exit Pisanio.]\n\nA sly and constant knave,\nNot to be shak’d; the agent for his master,\nAnd the remembrancer of her to hold\nThe hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that\nWhich, if he take, shall quite unpeople her\nOf liegers for her sweet; and which she after,\nExcept she bend her humour, shall be assur’d\nTo taste of too.\n\nEnter Pisanio and Ladies.\n\nSo, so. Well done, well done.\nThe violets, cowslips, and the primroses,\nBear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;\nThink on my words.\n\n[Exeunt Queen and Ladies.]\n\nPISANIO.\nAnd shall do.\nBut when to my good lord I prove untrue\nI’ll choke myself: there’s all I’ll do for you.\n\n[Exit.]",

O, that husband!\nMy supreme crown of grief! and those repeated\nVexations of it! Had I been thief-stol’n,\nAs my two brothers, happy! but most miserable\nIs the desire that’s glorious. Blessed be those,\nHow mean soe’er, that have their honest wills,\nWhich seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!\n\nEnter Pisanio and Iachimo.\n\nPISANIO.\nMadam, a noble gentleman of Rome\nComes from my lord with letters.\n\nIACHIMO.\nChange you, madam?\nThe worthy Leonatus is in safety,\nAnd greets your Highness dearly.\n\n[Presents a letter.]\n\nIMOGEN.\nThanks, good sir.\nYou’re kindly welcome.\n\nIACHIMO.\n[Aside.] All of her that is out of door most rich!\nIf she be furnish’d with a mind so rare,\nShe is alone th’ Arabian bird, and I\nHave lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!\nArm me, audacity, from head to foot!\nOr, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;\nRather, directly fly.\n\nIMOGEN.\n[Reads.] He is one of the noblest note, to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your trust.\n                    LEONATUS.\n\nSo far I read aloud;\nBut even the very middle of my heart\nIs warm’d by th’ rest and takes it thankfully.\nYou are as welcome, worthy sir, as I\nHave words to bid you; and shall find it so\nIn all that I can do.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThanks, fairest lady.\nWhat, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes\nTo see this vaulted arch and the rich crop\nOf sea and land, which can distinguish ’twixt\nThe fiery orbs above and the twinn’d stones\nUpon the number’d beach, and can we not\nPartition make with spectacles so precious\n’Twixt fair and foul?\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat makes your admiration?\n\nIACHIMO.\nIt cannot be i’ th’ eye, for apes and monkeys,\n’Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and\nContemn with mows the other; nor i’ th’ judgement,\nFor idiots in this case of favour would\nBe wisely definite; nor i’ th’ appetite;\nSluttery, to such neat excellence oppos’d,\nShould make desire vomit emptiness,\nNot so allur’d to feed.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat is the matter, trow?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe cloyed will—\nThat satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub\nBoth fill’d and running—ravening first the lamb,\nLongs after for the garbage.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat, dear sir,\nThus raps you? Are you well?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThanks, madam; well. Beseech you, sir,\nDesire my man’s abode where I did leave him.\nHe’s strange and peevish.\n\nPISANIO.\nI was going, sir,\nTo give him welcome.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nIMOGEN.\nContinues well my lord? His health beseech you?\n\nIACHIMO.\nWell, madam.\n\nIMOGEN.\nIs he dispos’d to mirth? I hope he is.\n\nIACHIMO.\nExceeding pleasant; none a stranger there\nSo merry and so gamesome. He is call’d\nThe Briton reveller.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhen he was here\nHe did incline to sadness, and oft-times\nNot knowing why.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI never saw him sad.\nThere is a Frenchman his companion, one\nAn eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves\nA Gallian girl at home. He furnaces\nThe thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly Briton\n(Your lord, I mean) laughs from’s free lungs, cries “O,\nCan my sides hold, to think that man, who knows\nBy history, report, or his own proof,\nWhat woman is, yea, what she cannot choose\nBut must be, will’s free hours languish for\nAssured bondage?”\n\nIMOGEN.\nWill my lord say so?\n\nIACHIMO.\nAy, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.\nIt is a recreation to be by\nAnd hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know\nSome men are much to blame.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNot he, I hope.\n\nIACHIMO.\nNot he; but yet heaven’s bounty towards him might\nBe us’d more thankfully. In himself, ’tis much;\nIn you, which I account his, beyond all talents.\nWhilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound\nTo pity too.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat do you pity, sir?\n\nIACHIMO.\nTwo creatures heartily.\n\nIMOGEN.\nAm I one, sir?\nYou look on me: what wreck discern you in me\nDeserves your pity?\n\nIACHIMO.\nLamentable! What,\nTo hide me from the radiant sun and solace\nI’ th’ dungeon by a snuff?\n\nIMOGEN.\nI pray you, sir,\nDeliver with more openness your answers\nTo my demands. Why do you pity me?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThat others do,\nI was about to say, enjoy your—But\nIt is an office of the gods to venge it,\nNot mine to speak on’t.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYou do seem to know\nSomething of me, or what concerns me; pray you,\nSince doubting things go ill often hurts more\nThan to be sure they do; for certainties\nEither are past remedies, or, timely knowing,\nThe remedy then born—discover to me\nWhat both you spur and stop.\n\nIACHIMO.\nHad I this cheek\nTo bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,\nWhose every touch, would force the feeler’s soul\nTo th’ oath of loyalty; this object, which\nTakes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,\nFixing it only here; should I, damn’d then,\nSlaver with lips as common as the stairs\nThat mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands\nMade hard with hourly falsehood (falsehood as\nWith labour): then by-peeping in an eye\nBase and illustrious as the smoky light\nThat’s fed with stinking tallow: it were fit\nThat all the plagues of hell should at one time\nEncounter such revolt.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMy lord, I fear,\nHas forgot Britain.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAnd himself. Not I\nInclin’d to this intelligence pronounce\nThe beggary of his change; but ’tis your graces\nThat from my mutest conscience to my tongue\nCharms this report out.\n\nIMOGEN.\nLet me hear no more.\n\nIACHIMO.\nO dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart\nWith pity that doth make me sick! A lady\nSo fair, and fasten’d to an empery,\nWould make the great’st king double, to be partner’d\nWith tomboys hir’d with that self exhibition\nWhich your own coffers yield! with diseas’d ventures\nThat play with all infirmities for gold\nWhich rottenness can lend nature! Such boil’d stuff\nAs well might poison poison! Be reveng’d;\nOr she that bore you was no queen, and you\nRecoil from your great stock.\n\nIMOGEN.\nReveng’d?\nHow should I be reveng’d? If this be true,\n(As I have such a heart that both mine ears\nMust not in haste abuse) if it be true,\nHow should I be reveng’d?\n\nIACHIMO.\nShould he make me\nLive like Diana’s priest betwixt cold sheets,\nWhiles he is vaulting variable ramps,\nIn your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.\nI dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,\nMore noble than that runagate to your bed,\nAnd will continue fast to your affection,\nStill close as sure.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhat ho, Pisanio!\n\nIACHIMO.\nLet me my service tender on your lips.\n\nIMOGEN.\nAway! I do condemn mine ears that have\nSo long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,\nThou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not\nFor such an end thou seek’st, as base as strange.\nThou wrong’st a gentleman who is as far\nFrom thy report as thou from honour; and\nSolicits here a lady that disdains\nThee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!\nThe King my father shall be made acquainted\nOf thy assault. If he shall think it fit\nA saucy stranger in his court to mart\nAs in a Romish stew, and to expound\nHis beastly mind to us, he hath a court\nHe little cares for, and a daughter who\nHe not respects at all. What ho, Pisanio!\n\nIACHIMO.\nO happy Leonatus! I may say\nThe credit that thy lady hath of thee\nDeserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness\nHer assur’d credit. Blessed live you long,\nA lady to the worthiest sir that ever\nCountry call’d his! and you his mistress, only\nFor the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.\nI have spoke this to know if your affiance\nWere deeply rooted, and shall make your lord\nThat which he is new o’er; and he is one\nThe truest manner’d, such a holy witch\nThat he enchants societies into him,\nHalf all men’s hearts are his.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYou make amends.\n\nIACHIMO.\nHe sits ’mongst men like a descended god:\nHe hath a kind of honour sets him off\nMore than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,\nMost mighty Princess, that I have adventur’d\nTo try your taking of a false report, which hath\nHonour’d with confirmation your great judgement\nIn the election of a sir so rare,\nWhich you know cannot err. The love I bear him\nMade me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,\nUnlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.\n\nIMOGEN.\nAll’s well, sir; take my pow’r i’ th’ court for yours.\n\nIACHIMO.\nMy humble thanks. I had almost forgot\nT’ entreat your Grace but in a small request,\nAnd yet of moment too, for it concerns\nYour lord; myself and other noble friends\nAre partners in the business.\n\nIMOGEN.\nPray what is’t?\n\nIACHIMO.\nSome dozen Romans of us, and your lord\n(The best feather of our wing) have mingled sums\nTo buy a present for the Emperor;\nWhich I, the factor for the rest, have done\nIn France. ’Tis plate of rare device, and jewels\nOf rich and exquisite form, their values great;\nAnd I am something curious, being strange,\nTo have them in safe stowage. May it please you\nTo take them in protection?\n\nIMOGEN.\nWillingly;\nAnd pawn mine honour for their safety. Since\nMy lord hath interest in them, I will keep them\nIn my bedchamber.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThey are in a trunk,\nAttended by my men. I will make bold\nTo send them to you only for this night;\nI must aboard tomorrow.\n\nIMOGEN.\nO, no, no.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYes, I beseech; or I shall short my word\nBy length’ning my return. From Gallia\nI cross’d the seas on purpose and on promise\nTo see your Grace.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI thank you for your pains.\nBut not away tomorrow!\n\nIACHIMO.\nO, I must, madam.\nTherefore I shall beseech you, if you please\nTo greet your lord with writing, do’t tonight.\nI have outstood my time, which is material\nTo th’ tender of our present.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI will write.\nSend your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept\nAnd truly yielded you. You’re very welcome.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n",

Faith,\nI shall unfold equal discourtesy\nTo your best kindness; one of your great knowing\nShould learn, being taught, forbearance.\n\nCLOTEN.\nTo leave you in your madness ’twere my sin;\nI will not.\n\nIMOGEN.\nFools are not mad folks.\n\nCLOTEN.\nDo you call me fool?\n\nIMOGEN.\nAs I am mad, I do;\nIf you’ll be patient, I’ll no more be mad;\nThat cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,\nYou put me to forget a lady’s manners\nBy being so verbal; and learn now, for all,\nThat I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,\nBy th’ very truth of it, I care not for you,\nAnd am so near the lack of charity\nTo accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather\nYou felt than make’t my boast.\n\nCLOTEN.\nYou sin against\nObedience, which you owe your father. For\nThe contract you pretend with that base wretch,\nOne bred of alms and foster’d with cold dishes,\nWith scraps o’ th’ court, it is no contract, none.\nAnd though it be allowed in meaner parties\n(Yet who than he more mean?) to knit their souls\n(On whom there is no more dependency\nBut brats and beggary) in self-figur’d knot,\nYet you are curb’d from that enlargement by\nThe consequence o’ th’ crown, and must not foil\nThe precious note of it with a base slave,\nA hilding for a livery, a squire’s cloth,\nA pantler; not so eminent!\n\nIMOGEN.\nProfane fellow!\nWert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more\nBut what thou art besides, thou wert too base\nTo be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,\nEven to the point of envy, if ’twere made\nComparative for your virtues to be styl’d\nThe under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated\nFor being preferr’d so well.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThe south fog rot him!\n\nIMOGEN.\nHe never can meet more mischance than come\nTo be but nam’d of thee. His mean’st garment\nThat ever hath but clipp’d his body, is dearer\nIn my respect, than all the hairs above thee,\nWere they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!\n\nEnter Pisanio.\n\nCLOTEN.\n‘His garment’! Now the devil—\n\nIMOGEN.\nTo Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.\n\nCLOTEN.\n‘His garment’!\n\nIMOGEN.\nI am sprited with a fool;\nFrighted, and ang’red worse. Go bid my woman\nSearch for a jewel that too casually\nHath left mine arm. It was thy master’s; shrew me,\nIf I would lose it for a revenue\nOf any king’s in Europe! I do think\nI saw’t this morning; confident I am\nLast night ’twas on mine arm; I kiss’d it.\nI hope it be not gone to tell my lord\nThat I kiss aught but he.\n\nPISANIO.\n’Twill not be lost.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI hope so. Go and search.\n\n[Exit Pisanio.]\n\nCLOTEN.\nYou have abus’d me.\n‘His meanest garment’!\n\nIMOGEN.\nAy, I said so, sir.\nIf you will make ’t an action, call witness to ’t.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI will inform your father.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYour mother too.\nShe’s my good lady and will conceive, I hope,\nBut the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,\nTo th’ worst of discontent.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCLOTEN.\nI’ll be reveng’d.\n‘His mean’st garment’! Well.\n\n[Exit.]",

In these fear’d hopes\nI barely gratify your love; they failing,\nI must die much your debtor.\nPHILARIO.\nYour very goodness and your company\nO’erpays all I can do. By this your king\nHath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius\nWill do’s commission throughly; and I think\nHe’ll grant the tribute, send th’ arrearages,\nOr look upon our Romans, whose remembrance\nIs yet fresh in their grief.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI do believe\nStatist though I am none, nor like to be,\nThat this will prove a war; and you shall hear\nThe legions now in Gallia sooner landed\nIn our not-fearing Britain than have tidings\nOf any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen\nAre men more order’d than when Julius Cæsar\nSmil’d at their lack of skill, but found their courage\nWorthy his frowning at. Their discipline,\nNow mingled with their courages, will make known\nTo their approvers they are people such\nThat mend upon the world.\n\nEnter Iachimo.\n\nPHILARIO.\nSee!

I hope you know that we\nMust not continue friends.\n\nIACHIMO.\nGood sir, we must,\nIf you keep covenant. Had I not brought\nThe knowledge of your mistress home, I grant\nWe were to question farther; but I now\nProfess myself the winner of her honour,\nTogether with your ring; and not the wronger\nOf her or you, having proceeded but\nBy both your wills.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nIf you can make’t apparent\nThat you have tasted her in bed, my hand\nAnd ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion\nYou had of her pure honour gains or loses\nYour sword or mine, or masterless leaves both\nTo who shall find them.\n\nIACHIMO.\nSir, my circumstances,\nBeing so near the truth as I will make them,\nMust first induce you to believe; whose strength\nI will confirm with oath; which I doubt not\nYou’ll give me leave to spare when you shall find\nYou need it not.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nProceed.\n\nIACHIMO.\nFirst, her bedchamber,\n(Where I confess I slept not, but profess\nHad that was well worth watching) it was hang’d\nWith tapestry of silk and silver; the story,\nProud Cleopatra when she met her Roman\nAnd Cydnus swell’d above the banks, or for\nThe press of boats or pride. A piece of work\nSo bravely done, so rich, that it did strive\nIn workmanship and value; which I wonder’d\nCould be so rarely and exactly wrought,\nSince the true life on’t was—\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is true;\nAnd this you might have heard of here, by me\nOr by some other.\n\nIACHIMO.\nMore particulars\nMust justify my knowledge.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSo they must,\nOr do your honour injury.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe chimney\nIs south the chamber, and the chimneypiece\nChaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures\nSo likely to report themselves. The cutter\nWas as another nature, dumb; outwent her,\nMotion and breath left out.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is a thing\nWhich you might from relation likewise reap,\nBeing, as it is, much spoke of.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThe roof o’ th’ chamber\nWith golden cherubins is fretted; her andirons\n(I had forgot them) were two winking Cupids\nOf silver, each on one foot standing, nicely\nDepending on their brands.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThis is her honour!\nLet it be granted you have seen all this, and praise\nBe given to your remembrance; the description\nOf what is in her chamber nothing saves\nThe wager you have laid.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThen, if you can, [Shows the bracelet]\nBe pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. See!\nAnd now ’tis up again. It must be married\nTo that your diamond; I’ll keep them.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nJove!\nOnce more let me behold it. Is it that\nWhich I left with her?\n\nIACHIMO.\nSir (I thank her) that.\nShe stripp’d it from her arm; I see her yet;\nHer pretty action did outsell her gift,\nAnd yet enrich’d it too. She gave it me, and said\nShe priz’d it once.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nMay be she pluck’d it off\nTo send it me.\n\nIACHIMO.\nShe writes so to you, doth she?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nO, no, no, no! ’tis true. Here, take this too;\n\n[Gives the ring.]\n\nIt is a basilisk unto mine eye,\nKills me to look on’t. Let there be no honour\nWhere there is beauty; truth where semblance; love\nWhere there’s another man. The vows of women\nOf no more bondage be to where they are made\nThan they are to their virtues, which is nothing.\nO, above measure false!\n\nPHILARIO.\nHave patience, sir,\nAnd take your ring again; ’tis not yet won.\nIt may be probable she lost it, or\nWho knows if one her women, being corrupted\nHath stol’n it from her?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nVery true;\nAnd so I hope he came by’t. Back my ring.\nRender to me some corporal sign about her,\nMore evident than this; for this was stol’n.\n\nIACHIMO.\nBy Jupiter, I had it from her arm!\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nHark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.\n’Tis true, nay, keep the ring, ’tis true. I am sure\nShe would not lose it. Her attendants are\nAll sworn and honourable:—they induc’d to steal it!\nAnd by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy’d her.\nThe cognizance of her incontinency\nIs this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.\nThere, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell\nDivide themselves between you!\nPHILARIO.\nSir, be patient;\nThis is not strong enough to be believ’d\nOf one persuaded well of.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNever talk on’t;\nShe hath been colted by him.\n\nIACHIMO.\nIf you seek\nFor further satisfying, under her breast\n(Worthy the pressing) lies a mole, right proud\nOf that most delicate lodging. By my life,\nI kiss’d it; and it gave me present hunger\nTo feed again, though full. You do remember\nThis stain upon her?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nAy, and it doth confirm\nAnother stain, as big as hell can hold,\nWere there no more but it.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWill you hear more?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nSpare your arithmetic; never count the turns.\nOnce, and a million!\n\nIACHIMO.\nI’ll be sworn—\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nNo swearing.\nIf you will swear you have not done’t, you lie;\nAnd I will kill thee if thou dost deny\nThou’st made me cuckold.\n\nIACHIMO.\nI’ll deny nothing.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nO that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!\nI will go there and do’t, i’ th’ court, before\nHer father. I’ll do something—\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPHILARIO.\nQuite besides\nThe government of patience! You have won.\nLet’s follow him and pervert the present wrath\nHe hath against himself.\n\nIACHIMO.\nWith all my heart.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Britain is a world by itself, and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses.\n\nQUEEN.\nThat opportunity,\nWhich then they had to take from’s, to resume\nWe have again. Remember, sir, my liege,\nThe kings your ancestors, together with\nThe natural bravery of your isle, which stands\nAs Neptune’s park, ribb’d and pal’d in\nWith rocks unscaleable and roaring waters,\nWith sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats\nBut suck them up to th’ top-mast. A kind of conquest\nCæsar made here, but made not here his brag\nOf ‘Came, and saw, and overcame.’ With shame\n(The first that ever touch’d him) he was carried\nFrom off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping\n(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,\nLike egg-shells mov’d upon their surges, crack’d\nAs easily ’gainst our rocks; for joy whereof\nThe fam’d Cassibelan, who was once at point\n(O, giglot fortune!) to master Cæsar’s sword,\nMade Lud’s Town with rejoicing fires bright\nAnd Britons strut with courage.\n\nCLOTEN.\nCome, there’s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no moe such Cæsars. Other of them may have crook’d noses; but to owe such straight arms, none.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nSon, let your mother end.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWe have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If Cæsar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nYou must know,\nTill the injurious Romans did extort\nThis tribute from us, we were free. Cæsar’s ambition,\nWhich swell’d so much that it did almost stretch\nThe sides o’ th’ world, against all colour here\nDid put the yoke upon’s; which to shake off\nBecomes a warlike people, whom we reckon\nOurselves to be.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWe do.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nSay then to Cæsar,\nOur ancestor was that Mulmutius which\nOrdain’d our laws, whose use the sword of Cæsar\nHath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise\nShall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,\nThough Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,\nWho was the first of Britain which did put\nHis brows within a golden crown, and call’d\nHimself a king.\n\nLUCIUS.\nI am sorry, Cymbeline,\nThat I am to pronounce Augustus Cæsar\n(Cæsar, that hath moe kings his servants than\nThyself domestic officers) thine enemy.\nReceive it from me, then: war and confusion\nIn Cæsar’s name pronounce I ’gainst thee; look\nFor fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,\nI thank thee for myself.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou art welcome, Caius.\nThy Cæsar knighted me; my youth I spent\nMuch under him; of him I gather’d honour,\nWhich he to seek of me again, perforce,\nBehoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect\nThat the Pannonians and Dalmatians for\nTheir liberties are now in arms, a precedent\nWhich not to read would show the Britons cold;\nSo Cæsar shall not find them.\n\nLUCIUS.\nLet proof speak.\n\nCLOTEN.\nHis majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and there’s an end.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSo, sir.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI know your master’s pleasure, and he mine;\nAll the remain is, welcome.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A mountainous country with a cave.\nEnter from the cave Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.\n\nBELARIUS.\nA goodly day not to keep house with such\nWhose roof’s as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate\nInstructs you how t’ adore the heavens, and bows you\nTo a morning’s holy office. The gates of monarchs\nAre arch’d so high that giants may jet through\nAnd keep their impious turbans on without\nGood morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!\nWe house i’ th’ rock, yet use thee not so hardly\nAs prouder livers do.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nHail, heaven!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nHail, heaven!\n\nBELARIUS.\nNow for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,\nYour legs are young; I’ll tread these flats. Consider,\nWhen you above perceive me like a crow,\nThat it is place which lessens and sets off;\nAnd you may then revolve what tales I have told you\nOf courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.\nThis service is not service so being done,\nBut being so allow’d. To apprehend thus\nDraws us a profit from all things we see,\nAnd often to our comfort shall we find\nThe sharded beetle in a safer hold\nThan is the full-wing’d eagle. O, this life\nIs nobler than attending for a check,\nRicher than doing nothing for a robe,\nProuder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:\nSuch gain the cap of him that makes him fine,\nYet keeps his book uncross’d. No life to ours!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nOut of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg’d,\nHave never wing’d from view o’ th’ nest, nor know not\nWhat air’s from home. Haply this life is best,\nIf quiet life be best; sweeter to you\nThat have a sharper known; well corresponding\nWith your stiff age. But unto us it is\nA cell of ignorance, travelling abed,\nA prison for a debtor that not dares\nTo stride a limit.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWhat should we speak of\nWhen we are old as you? When we shall hear\nThe rain and wind beat dark December, how,\nIn this our pinching cave, shall we discourse.\nThe freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;\nWe are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,\nLike warlike as the wolf for what we eat.\nOur valour is to chase what flies; our cage\nWe make a choir, as doth the prison’d bird,\nAnd sing our bondage freely.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHow you speak!\nDid you but know the city’s usuries,\nAnd felt them knowingly; the art o’ th’ court,\nAs hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb\nIs certain falling, or so slipp’ry that\nThe fear’s as bad as falling; the toil o’ th’ war,\nA pain that only seems to seek out danger\nI’ th’ name of fame and honour, which dies i’ th’ search,\nAnd hath as oft a sland’rous epitaph\nAs record of fair act; nay, many times,\nDoth ill deserve by doing well; what’s worse,\nMust curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story\nThe world may read in me; my body’s mark’d\nWith Roman swords, and my report was once\nFirst with the best of note. Cymbeline lov’d me;\nAnd when a soldier was the theme, my name\nWas not far off. Then was I as a tree\nWhose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night\nA storm, or robbery, call it what you will,\nShook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,\nAnd left me bare to weather.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nUncertain favour!\n\nBELARIUS.\nMy fault being nothing, as I have told you oft,\nBut that two villains, whose false oaths prevail’d\nBefore my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline\nI was confederate with the Romans. So\nFollow’d my banishment, and this twenty years\nThis rock and these demesnes have been my world,\nWhere I have liv’d at honest freedom, paid\nMore pious debts to heaven than in all\nThe fore-end of my time. But up to th’ mountains!\nThis is not hunters’ language. He that strikes\nThe venison first shall be the lord o’ th’ feast;\nTo him the other two shall minister;\nAnd we will fear no poison, which attends\nIn place of greater state. I’ll meet you in the valleys.\n\n[Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus.]\n\nHow hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!\nThese boys know little they are sons to th’ King,\nNor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.\nThey think they are mine; and though train’d up thus meanly\nI’ th’ cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit\nThe roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them\nIn simple and low things to prince it much\nBeyond the trick of others. This Polydore,\nThe heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who\nThe King his father call’d Guiderius—Jove!\nWhen on my three-foot stool I sit and tell\nThe warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out\nInto my story; say ‘Thus mine enemy fell,\nAnd thus I set my foot on’s neck’; even then\nThe princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,\nStrains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture\nThat acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,\nOnce Arviragus, in as like a figure\nStrikes life into my speech, and shows much more\nHis own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous’d!\nO Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows\nThou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon,\nAt three and two years old, I stole these babes,\nThinking to bar thee of succession as\nThou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,\nThou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,\nAnd every day do honour to her grave.\nMyself, Belarius, that am Morgan call’d,\nThey take for natural father. The game is up.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE IV. Wales, near Milford Haven.\nEnter Pisanio and Imogen.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThou told’st me, when we came from horse, the place\nWas near at hand. Ne’er long’d my mother so\nTo see me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man!\nWhere is Posthumus? What is in thy mind\nThat makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh\nFrom th’ inward of thee? One but painted thus\nWould be interpreted a thing perplex’d\nBeyond self-explication. Put thyself\nInto a haviour of less fear, ere wildness\nVanquish my staider senses. What’s the matter?\nWhy tender’st thou that paper to me with\nA look untender? If’t be summer news,\nSmile to’t before; if winterly, thou need’st\nBut keep that count’nance still. My husband’s hand?\nThat drug-damn’d Italy hath out-craftied him,\nAnd he’s at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue\nMay take off some extremity, which to read\nWould be even mortal to me.\n\nPISANIO.\nPlease you read,\nAnd you shall find me, wretched man, a thing\nThe most disdain’d of fortune.\n\nIMOGEN.\n[Reads.] Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play’d the strumpet in my bed, the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal.\n\nPISANIO.\nWhat shall I need to draw my sword? The paper\nHath cut her throat already. No, ’tis slander,\nWhose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue\nOutvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath\nRides on the posting winds and doth belie\nAll corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,\nMaids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,\nThis viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?\n\nIMOGEN.\nFalse to his bed? What is it to be false?\nTo lie in watch there, and to think on him?\nTo weep twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,\nTo break it with a fearful dream of him,\nAnd cry myself awake? That’s false to’s bed,\nIs it?\n\nPISANIO.\nAlas, good lady!\n\nIMOGEN.\nI false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,\nThou didst accuse him of incontinency;\nThou then look’dst like a villain; now, methinks,\nThy favour’s good enough. Some jay of Italy,\nWhose mother was her painting, hath betray’d him.\nPoor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,\nAnd for I am richer than to hang by th’ walls\nI must be ripp’d. To pieces with me! O,\nMen’s vows are women’s traitors! All good seeming,\nBy thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought\nPut on for villainy; not born where’t grows,\nBut worn a bait for ladies.\n\nPISANIO.\nGood madam, hear me.\n\nIMOGEN.\nTrue honest men being heard, like false Æneas,\nWere, in his time, thought false; and Sinon’s weeping\nDid scandal many a holy tear, took pity\nFrom most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,\nWilt lay the leaven on all proper men:\nGoodly and gallant shall be false and perjur’d\nFrom thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest;\nDo thou thy master’s bidding; when thou seest him,\nA little witness my obedience. Look!\nI draw the sword myself; take it, and hit\nThe innocent mansion of my love, my heart.\nFear not; ’tis empty of all things but grief;\nThy master is not there, who was indeed\nThe riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.\nThou mayst be valiant in a better cause,\nBut now thou seem’st a coward.\n\nPISANIO.\nHence, vile instrument!\nThou shalt not damn my hand.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhy, I must die;\nAnd if I do not by thy hand, thou art\nNo servant of thy master’s. Against self-slaughter\nThere is a prohibition so divine\nThat cravens my weak hand. Come, here’s my heart:\nSomething’s afore’t. Soft, soft! we’ll no defence,\nObedient as the scabbard. What is here?\nThe scriptures of the loyal Leonatus\nAll turn’d to heresy? Away, away,\nCorrupters of my faith, you shall no more\nBe stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools\nBelieve false teachers; though those that are betray’d\nDo feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor\nStands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,\nThat didst set up my disobedience ’gainst the King\nMy father, and make me put into contempt the suits\nOf princely fellows, shalt hereafter find\nIt is no act of common passage but\nA strain of rareness; and I grieve myself\nTo think, when thou shalt be disedg’d by her\nThat now thou tirest on, how thy memory\nWill then be pang’d by me. Prithee dispatch.\nThe lamb entreats the butcher. Where’s thy knife?\nThou art too slow to do thy master’s bidding,\nWhen I desire it too.\n\nPISANIO.\nO gracious lady,\nSince I receiv’d command to do this busines\nI have not slept one wink.\n\nIMOGEN.\nDo’t, and to bed then.\n\nPISANIO.\nI’ll wake mine eyeballs first.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWherefore then\nDidst undertake it? Why hast thou abus’d\nSo many miles with a pretence? This place?\nMine action and thine own? our horses’ labour?\nThe time inviting thee? The perturb’d court,\nFor my being absent? whereunto I never\nPurpose return. Why hast thou gone so far\nTo be unbent when thou hast ta’en thy stand,\nTh’ elected deer before thee?\n\nPISANIO.\nBut to win time\nTo lose so bad employment, in the which\nI have consider’d of a course. Good lady,\nHear me with patience.\n\nIMOGEN.\nTalk thy tongue weary, speak.\nI have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,\nTherein false struck, can take no greater wound,\nNor tent to bottom that. But speak.\n\nPISANIO.\nThen, madam,\nI thought you would not back again.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMost like,\nBringing me here to kill me.\n\nPISANIO.\nNot so, neither;\nBut if I were as wise as honest, then\nMy purpose would prove well. It cannot be\nBut that my master is abus’d. Some villain,\nAy, and singular in his art, hath done you both\nThis cursed injury.\n\nIMOGEN.\nSome Roman courtezan!\n\nPISANIO.\nNo, on my life!\nI’ll give but notice you are dead, and send him\nSome bloody sign of it, for ’tis commanded\nI should do so. You shall be miss’d at court,\nAnd that will well confirm it.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhy, good fellow,\nWhat shall I do the while? Where bide? How live?\nOr in my life what comfort, when I am\nDead to my husband?\n\nPISANIO.\nIf you’ll back to th’ court—\n\nIMOGEN.\nNo court, no father, nor no more ado\nWith that harsh, noble, simple nothing,\nThat Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me\nAs fearful as a siege.\n\nPISANIO.\nIf not at court,\nThen not in Britain must you bide.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhere then?\nHath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,\nAre they not but in Britain? I’ th’ world’s volume\nOur Britain seems as of it, but not in’t;\nIn a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee think\nThere’s livers out of Britain.\n\nPISANIO.\nI am most glad\nYou think of other place. Th’ ambassador,\nLucius the Roman, comes to Milford Haven\nTomorrow. Now, if you could wear a mind\nDark as your fortune is, and but disguise\nThat which t’ appear itself must not yet be\nBut by self-danger, you should tread a course\nPretty and full of view; yea, happily, near\nThe residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,\nThat though his actions were not visible, yet\nReport should render him hourly to your ear\nAs truly as he moves.\n\nIMOGEN.\nO! for such means,\nThough peril to my modesty, not death on’t,\nI would adventure.\n\nPISANIO.\nWell then, here’s the point:\nYou must forget to be a woman; change\nCommand into obedience; fear and niceness\n(The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,\nWoman it pretty self) into a waggish courage;\nReady in gibes, quick-answer’d, saucy, and\nAs quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must\nForget that rarest treasure of your cheek,\nExposing it (but, O, the harder heart!\nAlack, no remedy) to the greedy touch\nOf common-kissing Titan, and forget\nYour laboursome and dainty trims wherein\nYou made great Juno angry.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNay, be brief;\nI see into thy end, and am almost\nA man already.\n\nPISANIO.\nFirst, make yourself but like one.\nFore-thinking this, I have already fit\n(’Tis in my cloak-bag) doublet, hat, hose, all\nThat answer to them. Would you, in their serving,\nAnd with what imitation you can borrow\nFrom youth of such a season, ’fore noble Lucius\nPresent yourself, desire his service, tell him\nWherein you’re happy; which will make him know\nIf that his head have ear in music; doubtless\nWith joy he will embrace you; for he’s honourable,\nAnd, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad:\nYou have me, rich; and I will never fail\nBeginning nor supplyment.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThou art all the comfort\nThe gods will diet me with. Prithee away!\nThere’s more to be consider’d; but we’ll even\nAll that good time will give us. This attempt\nI am soldier to, and will abide it with\nA prince’s courage. Away, I prithee.\n\nPISANIO.\nWell, madam, we must take a short farewell,\nLest, being miss’d, I be suspected of\nYour carriage from the court. My noble mistress,\nHere is a box; I had it from the Queen.\nWhat’s in’t is precious. If you are sick at sea\nOr stomach-qualm’d at land, a dram of this\nWill drive away distemper. To some shade,\nAnd fit you to your manhood. May the gods\nDirect you to the best!\n\nIMOGEN.\nAmen. I thank thee.\n\n[Exeunt severally.]",

Cymbeline’s palace.\nEnter Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, Lucius and Lords.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThus far, and so farewell.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThanks, royal sir.\nMy emperor hath wrote; I must from hence,\nAnd am right sorry that I must report ye\nMy master’s enemy.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nOur subjects, sir,\nWill not endure his yoke; and for ourself\nTo show less sovereignty than they, must needs\nAppear unkinglike.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSo, sir. I desire of you\nA conduct overland to Milford Haven.\nMadam, all joy befall your Grace, and you!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMy lords, you are appointed for that office;\nThe due of honour in no point omit.\nSo farewell, noble Lucius.\n\nLUCIUS.\nYour hand, my lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nReceive it friendly; but from this time forth\nI wear it as your enemy.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSir, the event\nIs yet to name the winner. Fare you well.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nLeave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,\nTill he have cross’d the Severn. Happiness!\n\n[Exeunt Lucius and Lords.]\n\nQUEEN.\nHe goes hence frowning; but it honours us\nThat we have given him cause.\n\nCLOTEN.\n’Tis all the better;\nYour valiant Britons have their wishes in it.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nLucius hath wrote already to the Emperor\nHow it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely\nOur chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.\nThe pow’rs that he already hath in Gallia\nWill soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves\nHis war for Britain.\n\nQUEEN.\n’Tis not sleepy business,\nBut must be look’d to speedily and strongly.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nOur expectation that it would be thus\nHath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,\nWhere is our daughter? She hath not appear’d\nBefore the Roman, nor to us hath tender’d\nThe duty of the day. She looks us like\nA thing more made of malice than of duty;\nWe have noted it. Call her before us, for\nWe have been too slight in sufferance.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nQUEEN.\nRoyal sir,\nSince the exile of Posthumus, most retir’d\nHath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,\n’Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,\nForbear sharp speeches to her; she’s a lady\nSo tender of rebukes that words are strokes,\nAnd strokes death to her.\n\nEnter Attendant.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhere is she, sir? How\nCan her contempt be answer’d?\n\nATTENDANT.\nPlease you, sir,\nHer chambers are all lock’d, and there’s no answer\nThat will be given to th’ loud of noise we make.\n\nQUEEN.\nMy lord, when last I went to visit her,\nShe pray’d me to excuse her keeping close;\nWhereto constrain’d by her infirmity\nShe should that duty leave unpaid to you\nWhich daily she was bound to proffer. This\nShe wish’d me to make known; but our great court\nMade me to blame in memory.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHer doors lock’d?\nNot seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear\nProve false!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nQUEEN.\nSon, I say, follow the King.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThat man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,\nI have not seen these two days.\n\nQUEEN.\nGo, look after.\n\n[Exit Cloten.]\n\nPisanio, thou that stand’st so for Posthumus!\nHe hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence\nProceed by swallowing that; for he believes\nIt is a thing most precious. But for her,\nWhere is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz’d her;\nOr, wing’d with fervour of her love, she’s flown\nTo her desir’d Posthumus. Gone she is\nTo death or to dishonour, and my end\nCan make good use of either. She being down,\nI have the placing of the British crown.\n\nEnter Cloten.\n\nHow now, my son?\n\nCLOTEN.\n’Tis certain she is fled.\nGo in and cheer the King. He rages; none\nDare come about him.\n\nQUEEN.\nAll the better. May\nThis night forestall him of the coming day!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCLOTEN.\nI love and hate her; for she’s fair and royal,\nAnd that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite\nThan lady, ladies, woman. From every one\nThe best she hath, and she, of all compounded,\nOutsells them all. I love her therefore; but\nDisdaining me and throwing favours on\nThe low Posthumus slanders so her judgement\nThat what’s else rare is chok’d; and in that point\nI will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,\nTo be reveng’d upon her. For when fools\nShall—\n\nEnter Pisanio.\n\nWho is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?\nCome hither. Ah, you precious pandar! Villain,\nWhere is thy lady? In a word, or else\nThou art straightway with the fiends.\n\nPISANIO.\nO good my lord!\n\nCLOTEN.\nWhere is thy lady? or, by Jupiter—\nI will not ask again. Close villain,\nI’ll have this secret from thy heart, or rip\nThy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?\nFrom whose so many weights of baseness cannot\nA dram of worth be drawn.\n\nPISANIO.\nAlas, my lord,\nHow can she be with him? When was she miss’d?\nHe is in Rome.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWhere is she, sir? Come nearer.\nNo farther halting! Satisfy me home\nWhat is become of her.\n\nPISANIO.\nO my all-worthy lord!\n\nCLOTEN.\nAll-worthy villain!\nDiscover where thy mistress is at once,\nAt the next word. No more of ‘worthy lord’!\nSpeak, or thy silence on the instant is\nThy condemnation and thy death.\n\nPISANIO.\nThen, sir,\nThis paper is the history of my knowledge\nTouching her flight.\n\n[Presenting a letter.]\n\nCLOTEN.\nLet’s see’t. I will pursue her\nEven to Augustus’ throne.\n\nPISANIO.\n[Aside.] Or this or perish.\nShe’s far enough; and what he learns by this\nMay prove his travel, not her danger.\n\nCLOTEN.\nHumh!\n\nPISANIO.\n[Aside.] I’ll write to my lord she’s dead. O Imogen,\nSafe mayst thou wander, safe return again!\n\nCLOTEN.\nSirrah, is this letter true?\n\nPISANIO.\nSir, as I think.\n\nCLOTEN.\nIt is Posthumus’ hand; I know’t. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry—that is, what villainy soe’er I bid thee do, to perform it directly and truly—I would think thee an honest man; thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment.\n\nPISANIO.\nWell, my good lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nWilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou serve me?\n\nPISANIO.\nSir, I will.\n\nCLOTEN.\nGive me thy hand; here’s my purse. Hast any of thy late master’s garments in thy possession?\n\nPISANIO.\nI have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThe first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let it be thy first service; go.\n\nPISANIO.\nI shall, my lord.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCLOTEN.\nMeet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing; I’ll remember’t anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a time—the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart—that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valour, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined—which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so prais’d—to the court I’ll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath despis’d me rejoicingly, and I’ll be merry in my revenge.\n\nEnter Pisanio with the clothes.\n\nBe those the garments?\n\nPISANIO.\nAy, my noble lord.\n\nCLOTEN.\nHow long is’t since she went to Milford Haven?\n\nPISANIO.\nShe can scarce be there yet.\n\nCLOTEN.\nBring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous and true, preferment shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford, would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPISANIO.\nThou bid’st me to my loss; for true to thee\nWere to prove false, which I will never be,\nTo him that is most true. To Milford go,\nAnd find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,\nYou heavenly blessings, on her! This fool’s speed\nBe cross’d with slowness! Labour be his meed!\n\n[Exit.]",

Gods!\n\nBELARIUS.\n[Whispering.] Hark, boys.\n\nIMOGEN.\n[Aside.] Great men,\nThat had a court no bigger than this cave,\nThat did attend themselves, and had the virtue\nWhich their own conscience seal’d them, laying by\nThat nothing-gift of differing multitudes,\nCould not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!\nI’d change my sex to be companion with them,\nSince Leonatus false.\n\nBELARIUS.\nIt shall be so.\nBoys, we’ll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in.\nDiscourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp’d,\nWe’ll mannerly demand thee of thy story,\nSo far as thou wilt speak it.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nPray draw near.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nThe night to th’ owl and morn to th’ lark less\nwelcome.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThanks, sir.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nI pray draw near.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

How fit his garments serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit too? The rather, saving reverence of the word, for ’tis said a woman’s fitness comes by fits. Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber; I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before her face; and all this done, spurn her home to her father, who may, haply, be a little angry for my so rough usage; but my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the very description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not deceive me.\n\n[Exit.]",

Remain here in the cave;\nWe’ll come to you after hunting.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n[To Imogen.] Brother, stay here.\nAre we not brothers?\n\nIMOGEN.\nSo man and man should be;\nBut clay and clay differs in dignity,\nWhose dust is both alike. I am very sick.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nGo you to hunting; I’ll abide with him.\n\nIMOGEN.\nSo sick I am not, yet I am not well;\nBut not so citizen a wanton as\nTo seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me;\nStick to your journal course. The breach of custom\nIs breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me\nCannot amend me; society is no comfort\nTo one not sociable. I am not very sick,\nSince I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here.\nI’ll rob none but myself; and let me die,\nStealing so poorly.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI love thee; I have spoke it.\nHow much the quantity, the weight as much\nAs I do love my father.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWhat? how? how?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIf it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me\nIn my good brother’s fault. I know not why\nI love this youth, and I have heard you say\nLove’s reason’s without reason.

Gods, what lies I\nhave heard!\nOur courtiers say all’s savage but at court.\nExperience, O, thou disprov’st report!\nTh’ imperious seas breed monsters; for the dish,\nPoor tributary rivers as sweet fish.\nI am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,\nI’ll now taste of thy drug.\n\n[Swallows some.]\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI could not stir him.\nHe said he was gentle, but unfortunate;\nDishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nThus did he answer me; yet said hereafter\nI might know more.\n\nBELARIUS.\nTo th’ field, to th’ field!\nWe’ll leave you for this time. Go in and rest.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWe’ll not be long away.\n\nBELARIUS.\nPray be not sick,\nFor you must be our huswife.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWell, or ill,\nI am bound to you.\n\nBELARIUS.\nAnd shalt be ever.\n\n[Exit Imogen into the cave.]\n\nThis youth, howe’er distress’d, appears he hath had\nGood ancestors.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nHow angel-like he sings!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nBut his neat cookery!

Come, away! Who’s there?\n\nEnter Cloten.\n\nCLOTEN.\nI cannot find those runagates; that villain\nHath mock’d me. I am faint.\n\nBELARIUS.\nThose runagates?\nMeans he not us? I partly know him; ’tis\nCloten, the son o’ th’ Queen. I fear some ambush.\nI saw him not these many years, and yet\nI know ’tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nHe is but one; you and my brother search\nWhat companies are near. Pray you away;\nLet me alone with him.\n\n[Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus.]\n\nCLOTEN.\nSoft! What are you\nThat fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?\nI have heard of such. What slave art thou?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nA thing\nMore slavish did I ne’er than answering\nA slave without a knock.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou art a robber,\nA law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nTo who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I\nAn arm as big as thine, a heart as big?\nThy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not\nMy dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art;\nWhy I should yield to thee.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou villain base,\nKnow’st me not by my clothes?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nNo, nor thy tailor, rascal,\nWho is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,\nWhich, as it seems, make thee.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou precious varlet,\nMy tailor made them not.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nHence, then, and thank\nThe man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;\nI am loath to beat thee.\n\nCLOTEN.\nThou injurious thief,\nHear but my name, and tremble.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhat’s thy name?\n\nCLOTEN.\nCloten, thou villain.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nCloten, thou double villain, be thy name,\nI cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,\n’Twould move me sooner.\n\nCLOTEN.\nTo thy further fear,\nNay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know\nI am son to th’ Queen.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI’m sorry for’t; not seeming\nSo worthy as thy birth.\n\nCLOTEN.\nArt not afeard?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThose that I reverence, those I fear—the wise;\nAt fools I laugh, not fear them.\n\nCLOTEN.\nDie the death.\nWhen I have slain thee with my proper hand,\nI’ll follow those that even now fled hence,\nAnd on the gates of Lud’s Town set your heads.\nYield, rustic mountaineer.\n\n[Exeunt, fighting.]\n\nEnter Belarius and Arviragus.\n\nBELARIUS.\nNo company’s abroad?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nNone in the world; you did mistake him, sure.\n\nBELARIUS.\nI cannot tell; long is it since I saw him,\nBut time hath nothing blurr’d those lines of favour\nWhich then he wore; the snatches in his voice,\nAnd burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute\n’Twas very Cloten.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIn this place we left them.\nI wish my brother make good time with him,\nYou say he is so fell.\n\nBELARIUS.\nBeing scarce made up,\nI mean to man, he had not apprehension\nOr roaring terrors; for defect of judgement\nIs oft the cease of fear.\n\nEnter Guiderius with Cloten’s head.\n\nBut, see, thy brother.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThis Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;\nThere was no money in’t. Not Hercules\nCould have knock’d out his brains, for he had none;\nYet I not doing this, the fool had borne\nMy head as I do his.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWhat hast thou done?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI am perfect what: cut off one Cloten’s head,\nSon to the Queen, after his own report;\nWho call’d me traitor, mountaineer, and swore\nWith his own single hand he’d take us in,\nDisplace our heads where, thank the gods, they grow,\nAnd set them on Lud’s Town.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWe are all undone.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhy, worthy father, what have we to lose\nBut that he swore to take, our lives? The law\nProtects not us; then why should we be tender\nTo let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,\nPlay judge and executioner all himself,\nFor we do fear the law? What company\nDiscover you abroad?\n\nBELARIUS.\nNo single soul\nCan we set eye on, but in all safe reason\nHe must have some attendants. Though his humour\nWas nothing but mutation, ay, and that\nFrom one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not\nAbsolute madness could so far have rav’d,\nTo bring him here alone. Although perhaps\nIt may be heard at court that such as we\nCave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time\nMay make some stronger head, the which he hearing,\nAs it is like him, might break out and swear\nHe’d fetch us in; yet is’t not probable\nTo come alone, either he so undertaking\nOr they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,\nIf we do fear this body hath a tail\nMore perilous than the head.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nLet ordinance\nCome as the gods foresay it. Howsoe’er,\nMy brother hath done well.\n\nBELARIUS.\nI had no mind\nTo hunt this day; the boy Fidele’s sickness\nDid make my way long forth.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWith his own sword,\nWhich he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en\nHis head from him. I’ll throw’t into the creek\nBehind our rock, and let it to the sea\nAnd tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten.\nThat’s all I reck.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBELARIUS.\nI fear ’twill be reveng’d.\nWould, Polydore, thou hadst not done’t! though valour\nBecomes thee well enough.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWould I had done’t,\nSo the revenge alone pursu’d me! Polydore,\nI love thee brotherly, but envy much\nThou hast robb’d me of this deed. I would revenges,\nThat possible strength might meet, would seek us through,\nAnd put us to our answer.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWell, ’tis done.\nWe’ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger\nWhere there’s no profit. I prithee to our rock.\nYou and Fidele play the cooks; I’ll stay\nTill hasty Polydore return, and bring him\nTo dinner presently.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nPoor sick Fidele!\nI’ll willingly to him; to gain his colour\nI’d let a parish of such Cloten’s blood,\nAnd praise myself for charity.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBELARIUS.\nO thou goddess,\nThou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon’st\nIn these two princely boys! They are as gentle\nAs zephyrs blowing below the violet,\nNot wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,\nTheir royal blood enchaf’d, as the rud’st wind\nThat by the top doth take the mountain pine\nAnd make him stoop to th’ vale. ’Tis wonder\nThat an invisible instinct should frame them\nTo royalty unlearn’d, honour untaught,\nCivility not seen from other, valour\nThat wildly grows in them, but yields a crop\nAs if it had been sow’d. Yet still it’s strange\nWhat Cloten’s being here to us portends,\nOr what his death will bring us.\n\nEnter Guiderius.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhere’s my brother?\nI have sent Cloten’s clotpoll down the stream,\nIn embassy to his mother; his body’s hostage\nFor his return.\n\n[Solemn music.]\n\nBELARIUS.\nMy ingenious instrument!\nHark, Polydore, it sounds. But what occasion\nHath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nIs he at home?\n\nBELARIUS.\nHe went hence even now.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhat does he mean? Since death of my dear’st mother\nIt did not speak before. All solemn things\nShould answer solemn accidents. The matter?\nTriumphs for nothing and lamenting toys\nIs jollity for apes and grief for boys.\nIs Cadwal mad?\n\nEnter Arviragus with Imogen as dead, bearing her in his arms.\n\nBELARIUS.\nLook, here he comes,\nAnd brings the dire occasion in his arms\nOf what we blame him for!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nThe bird is dead\nThat we have made so much on. I had rather\nHave skipp’d from sixteen years of age to sixty,\nTo have turn’d my leaping time into a crutch,\nThan have seen this.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nO sweetest, fairest lily!\nMy brother wears thee not the one half so well\nAs when thou grew’st thyself.\n\nBELARIUS.\nO melancholy!\nWho ever yet could sound thy bottom? find\nThe ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare\nMight’st easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!\nJove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,\nThou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.\nHow found you him?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nStark, as you see;\nThus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,\nNot as death’s dart, being laugh’d at; his right cheek\nReposing on a cushion.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhere?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nO’ th’ floor;\nHis arms thus leagu’d. I thought he slept, and put\nMy clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness\nAnswer’d my steps too loud.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWhy, he but sleeps.\nIf he be gone he’ll make his grave a bed;\nWith female fairies will his tomb be haunted,\nAnd worms will not come to thee.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWith fairest flowers,\nWhilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,\nI’ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack\nThe flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose; nor\nThe azur’d hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor\nThe leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,\nOut-sweet’ned not thy breath. The ruddock would,\nWith charitable bill (O bill, sore shaming\nThose rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie\nWithout a monument!) bring thee all this;\nYea, and furr’d moss besides, when flow’rs are none,\nTo winter-ground thy corse—\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nPrithee have done,\nAnd do not play in wench-like words with that\nWhich is so serious. Let us bury him,\nAnd not protract with admiration what\nIs now due debt. To th’ grave.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nSay, where shall’s lay him?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nBy good Euriphile, our mother.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nBe’t so;\nAnd let us, Polydore, though now our voices\nHave got the mannish crack, sing him to th’ ground,\nAs once to our mother; use like note and words,\nSave that Euriphile must be Fidele.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nCadwal,\nI cannot sing. I’ll weep, and word it with thee;\nFor notes of sorrow out of tune are worse\nThan priests and fanes that lie.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nWe’ll speak it, then.\n\nBELARIUS.\nGreat griefs, I see, med’cine the less, for Cloten\nIs quite forgot. He was a queen’s son, boys;\nAnd though he came our enemy, remember\nHe was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rotting\nTogether have one dust, yet reverence,\nThat angel of the world, doth make distinction\nOf place ’tween high and low. Our foe was princely;\nAnd though you took his life, as being our foe,\nYet bury him as a prince.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nPray you fetch him hither.\nThersites’ body is as good as Ajax’,\nWhen neither are alive.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIf you’ll go fetch him,\nWe’ll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.\n\n[Exit Belarius.]\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nNay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th’ East;\nMy father hath a reason for’t.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n’Tis true.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nCome on, then, and remove him.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nSo. Begin.\n\nSONG\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n    Fear no more the heat o’ th’ sun,\n        Nor the furious winter’s rages;\n    Thou thy worldly task hast done,\n        Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages.\n    Golden lads and girls all must,\n    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n    Fear no more the frown o’ th’ great;\n        Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke.\n    Care no more to clothe and eat;\n        To thee the reed is as the oak.\n    The sceptre, learning, physic, must\n    All follow this and come to dust.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n    Fear no more the lightning flash.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n        Nor th’ all-dreaded thunder-stone.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n    Fear not slander, censure rash;\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n    Thou hast finish’d joy and moan.\n\nBOTH.\n    All lovers young, all lovers must\n    Consign to thee and come to dust.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n    No exorciser harm thee!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n    Nor no witchcraft charm thee!\n\nGUIDERIUS.\n    Ghost unlaid forbear thee!\n\nARVIRAGUS.\n    Nothing ill come near thee!\n\nBOTH.\n    Quiet consummation have,\n    And renowned be thy grave!\n\nEnter Belarius with the body of Cloten.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nWe have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHere’s a few flowers; but ’bout midnight, more.\nThe herbs that have on them cold dew o’ th’ night\nAre strewings fit’st for graves. Upon their faces.\nYou were as flow’rs, now wither’d. Even so\nThese herblets shall which we upon you strew.\nCome on, away. Apart upon our knees.\nThe ground that gave them first has them again.\nTheir pleasures here are past, so is their pain.\n\n[Exeunt all but Imogen.]\n\nIMOGEN.\n[Awaking.] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way?\nI thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?\n’Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?\nI have gone all night. Faith, I’ll lie down and sleep.\nBut, soft! no bedfellow. O gods and goddesses!\n\n[Seeing the body.]\n\nThese flow’rs are like the pleasures of the world;\nThis bloody man, the care on’t. I hope I dream;\nFor so I thought I was a cave-keeper,\nAnd cook to honest creatures. But ’tis not so;\n’Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,\nWhich the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes\nAre sometimes, like our judgements, blind. Good faith,\nI tremble still with fear; but if there be\nYet left in heaven as small a drop of pity\nAs a wren’s eye, fear’d gods, a part of it!\nThe dream’s here still. Even when I wake it is\nWithout me, as within me; not imagin’d, felt.\nA headless man? The garments of Posthumus?\nI know the shape of’s leg; this is his hand,\nHis foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,\nThe brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face—\nMurder in heaven! How! ’Tis gone. Pisanio,\nAll curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,\nAnd mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,\nConspir’d with that irregulous devil, Cloten,\nHath here cut off my lord. To write and read\nBe henceforth treacherous! Damn’d Pisanio\nHath with his forged letters (damn’d Pisanio)\nFrom this most bravest vessel of the world\nStruck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas,\nWhere is thy head? Where’s that? Ay me! where’s that?\nPisanio might have kill’d thee at the heart,\nAnd left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?\n’Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them\nHave laid this woe here. O, ’tis pregnant, pregnant!\nThe drug he gave me, which he said was precious\nAnd cordial to me, have I not found it\nMurd’rous to th’ senses? That confirms it home.\nThis is Pisanio’s deed, and Cloten. O!\nGive colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,\nThat we the horrider may seem to those\nWhich chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!\n\n[Falls fainting on the body.]\n\nEnter Lucius, Captains and a Soothsayer.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nTo them the legions garrison’d in Gallia,\nAfter your will, have cross’d the sea, attending\nYou here at Milford Haven; with your ships,\nThey are in readiness.\n\nLUCIUS.\nBut what from Rome?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nThe Senate hath stirr’d up the confiners\nAnd gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,\nThat promise noble service; and they come\nUnder the conduct of bold Iachimo,\nSienna’s brother.\n\nLUCIUS.\nWhen expect you them?\n\nCAPTAIN.\nWith the next benefit o’ th’ wind.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThis forwardness\nMakes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers\nBe muster’d; bid the captains look to’t. Now, sir,\nWhat have you dream’d of late of this war’s purpose?\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nLast night the very gods show’d me a vision\n(I fast and pray’d for their intelligence) thus:\nI saw Jove’s bird, the Roman eagle, wing’d\nFrom the spongy south to this part of the west,\nThere vanish’d in the sunbeams; which portends,\nUnless my sins abuse my divination,\nSuccess to th’ Roman host.\n\nLUCIUS.\nDream often so,\nAnd never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here\nWithout his top? The ruin speaks that sometime\nIt was a worthy building. How? a page?\nOr dead or sleeping on him? But dead, rather;\nFor nature doth abhor to make his bed\nWith the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.\nLet’s see the boy’s face.\n\nCAPTAIN.\nHe’s alive, my lord.\n\nLUCIUS.\nHe’ll then instruct us of this body. Young one,\nInform us of thy fortunes; for it seems\nThey crave to be demanded. Who is this\nThou mak’st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he\nThat, otherwise than noble nature did,\nHath alter’d that good picture? What’s thy interest\nIn this sad wreck? How came’t? Who is’t?\nWhat art thou?\n\nIMOGEN.\nI am nothing; or if not,\nNothing to be were better. This was my master,\nA very valiant Briton and a good,\nThat here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!\nThere is no more such masters. I may wander\nFrom east to occident; cry out for service;\nTry many, all good; serve truly; never\nFind such another master.\n\nLUCIUS.\n’Lack, good youth!\nThou mov’st no less with thy complaining than\nThy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.\n\nIMOGEN.\nRichard du Champ. [Aside.] If I do lie, and do\nNo harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope\nThey’ll pardon it.—Say you, sir?\n\nLUCIUS.\nThy name?\n\nIMOGEN.\nFidele, sir.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThou dost approve thyself the very same;\nThy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.\nWilt take thy chance with me? I will not say\nThou shalt be so well master’d; but, be sure,\nNo less belov’d. The Roman Emperor’s letters,\nSent by a consul to me, should not sooner\nThan thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI’ll follow, sir. But first, an’t please the gods,\nI’ll hide my master from the flies, as deep\nAs these poor pickaxes can dig; and when\nWith wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha’ strew’d his grave,\nAnd on it said a century of prayers,\nSuch as I can, twice o’er, I’ll weep and sigh;\nAnd leaving so his service, follow you,\nSo please you entertain me.\n\nLUCIUS.\nAy, good youth;\nAnd rather father thee than master thee.\nMy friends,\nThe boy hath taught us manly duties; let us\nFind out the prettiest daisied plot we can,\nAnd make him with our pikes and partisans\nA grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr’d\nBy thee to us; and he shall be interr’d\nAs soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.\nSome falls are means the happier to arise.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice.

But a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYes indeed do I, fellow.\n\nGAOLER.\nYour death has eyes in’s head, then; I have not seen him so pictur’d. You must either be directed by some that take upon them to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril. And how you shall speed in your journey’s end, I think you’ll never return to tell one.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.\n\nGAOLER.\nWhat an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging’s the way of winking.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nKnock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThou bring’st good news: I am call’d to be made free.\n\nGAOLER.\nI’ll be hang’d then.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nThou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.\n\n[Exeunt Posthumus and Messenger.]\n\nGAOLER.\nUnless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets, I never saw one so prone.

I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in’t.\n\n[Exit.]",

Report it.\n\nBELARIUS.\nSir,\nIn Cambria are we born, and gentlemen;\nFurther to boast were neither true nor modest,\nUnless I add we are honest.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nBow your knees.\nArise my knights o’ th’ battle; I create you\nCompanions to our person, and will fit you\nWith dignities becoming your estates.\n\nEnter Cornelius and Ladies.\n\nThere’s business in these faces. Why so sadly\nGreet you our victory? You look like Romans,\nAnd not o’ th’ court of Britain.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nHail, great King!\nTo sour your happiness I must report\nThe Queen is dead.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWho worse than a physician\nWould this report become? But I consider\nBy med’cine life may be prolong’d, yet death\nWill seize the doctor too. How ended she?\n\nCORNELIUS.\nWith horror, madly dying, like her life;\nWhich, being cruel to the world, concluded\nMost cruel to herself. What she confess’d\nI will report, so please you; these her women\nCan trip me if I err, who with wet cheeks\nWere present when she finish’d.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nPrithee say.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nFirst, she confess’d she never lov’d you; only\nAffected greatness got by you, not you;\nMarried your royalty, was wife to your place;\nAbhorr’d your person.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nShe alone knew this;\nAnd but she spoke it dying, I would not\nBelieve her lips in opening it. Proceed.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nYour daughter, whom she bore in hand to love\nWith such integrity, she did confess\nWas as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,\nBut that her flight prevented it, she had\nTa’en off by poison.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO most delicate fiend!\nWho is’t can read a woman? Is there more?\n\nCORNELIUS.\nMore, sir, and worse. She did confess she had\nFor you a mortal mineral, which, being took,\nShould by the minute feed on life, and ling’ring,\nBy inches waste you. In which time she purpos’d,\nBy watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to\nO’ercome you with her show; and in time,\nWhen she had fitted you with her craft, to work\nHer son into th’ adoption of the crown;\nBut failing of her end by his strange absence,\nGrew shameless-desperate, open’d, in despite\nOf heaven and men, her purposes, repented\nThe evils she hatch’d were not effected; so,\nDespairing, died.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHeard you all this, her women?\n\nLADIES.\nWe did, so please your Highness.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMine eyes\nWere not in fault, for she was beautiful;\nMine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart\nThat thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious\nTo have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter!\nThat it was folly in me thou mayst say,\nAnd prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!\n\nEnter Lucius, Iachimo, the Soothsayer and other Roman prisoners, guarded; Posthumus behind, and Imogen.\n\nThou com’st not, Caius, now for tribute; that\nThe Britons have raz’d out, though with the loss\nOf many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit\nThat their good souls may be appeas’d with slaughter\nOf you their captives, which ourself have granted;\nSo think of your estate.\n\nLUCIUS.\nConsider, sir, the chance of war. The day\nWas yours by accident; had it gone with us,\nWe should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten’d\nOur prisoners with the sword. But since the gods\nWill have it thus, that nothing but our lives\nMay be call’d ransom, let it come. Sufficeth\nA Roman with a Roman’s heart can suffer.\nAugustus lives to think on’t; and so much\nFor my peculiar care. This one thing only\nI will entreat: my boy, a Briton born,\nLet him be ransom’d. Never master had\nA page so kind, so duteous, diligent,\nSo tender over his occasions, true,\nSo feat, so nurse-like; let his virtue join\nWith my request, which I’ll make bold your Highness\nCannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm\nThough he have serv’d a Roman. Save him, sir,\nAnd spare no blood beside.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI have surely seen him;\nHis favour is familiar to me. Boy,\nThou hast look’d thyself into my grace,\nAnd art mine own. I know not why, wherefore\nTo say “Live, boy.” Ne’er thank thy master. Live;\nAnd ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,\nFitting my bounty and thy state, I’ll give it;\nYea, though thou do demand a prisoner,\nThe noblest ta’en.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI humbly thank your Highness.\n\nLUCIUS.\nI do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,\nAnd yet I know thou wilt.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNo, no! Alack,\nThere’s other work in hand. I see a thing\nBitter to me as death; your life, good master,\nMust shuffle for itself.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThe boy disdains me,\nHe leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys\nThat place them on the truth of girls and boys.\nWhy stands he so perplex’d?\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhat wouldst thou, boy?\nI love thee more and more; think more and more\nWhat’s best to ask. Know’st him thou look’st on? Speak,\nWilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?\n\nIMOGEN.\nHe is a Roman, no more kin to me\nThan I to your Highness; who, being born your vassal,\nAm something nearer.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWherefore ey’st him so?\n\nIMOGEN.\nI’ll tell you, sir, in private, if you please\nTo give me hearing.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAy, with all my heart,\nAnd lend my best attention. What’s thy name?\n\nIMOGEN.\nFidele, sir.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou’rt my good youth, my page;\nI’ll be thy master. Walk with me; speak freely.\n[Cymbeline and Imogen converse apart.]\n\nBELARIUS.\nIs not this boy reviv’d from death?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nOne sand another\nNot more resembles that sweet rosy lad\nWho died and was Fidele. What think you?\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThe same dead thing alive.\n\nBELARIUS.\nPeace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear.\nCreatures may be alike; were’t he, I am sure\nHe would have spoke to us.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nBut we see him dead.\n\nBELARIUS.\nBe silent; let’s see further.\n\nPISANIO.\n[Aside.] It is my mistress.\nSince she is living, let the time run on\nTo good or bad.\n\n[Cymbeline and Imogen advance.]\n\nCYMBELINE.\nCome, stand thou by our side;\nMake thy demand aloud. [To Iachimo.] Sir, step you forth;\nGive answer to this boy, and do it freely,\nOr, by our greatness and the grace of it,\nWhich is our honour, bitter torture shall\nWinnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMy boon is that this gentleman may render\nOf whom he had this ring.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\n[Aside.] What’s that to him?\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThat diamond upon your finger, say\nHow came it yours?\n\nIACHIMO.\nThou’lt torture me to leave unspoken that\nWhich to be spoke would torture thee.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHow? me?\n\nIACHIMO.\nI am glad to be constrain’d to utter that\nWhich torments me to conceal. By villainy\nI got this ring; ’twas Leonatus’ jewel,\nWhom thou didst banish; and—which more may grieve thee,\nAs it doth me—a nobler sir ne’er liv’d\n’Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAll that belongs to this.\n\nIACHIMO.\nThat paragon, thy daughter,\nFor whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits\nQuail to remember—Give me leave, I faint.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMy daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength;\nI had rather thou shouldst live while nature will\nThan die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.\n\nIACHIMO.\nUpon a time, unhappy was the clock\nThat struck the hour: was in Rome, accurs’d\nThe mansion where: ’twas at a feast, O, would\nOur viands had been poison’d (or at least\nThose which I heav’d to head) the good Posthumus\n(What should I say? he was too good to be\nWhere ill men were, and was the best of all\nAmongst the rar’st of good ones) sitting sadly\nHearing us praise our loves of Italy\nFor beauty that made barren the swell’d boast\nOf him that best could speak; for feature, laming\nThe shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,\nPostures beyond brief nature; for condition,\nA shop of all the qualities that man\nLoves woman for; besides that hook of wiving,\nFairness which strikes the eye.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI stand on fire.\nCome to the matter.\n\nIACHIMO.\nAll too soon I shall,\nUnless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,\nMost like a noble lord in love and one\nThat had a royal lover, took his hint;\nAnd (not dispraising whom we prais’d, therein\nHe was as calm as virtue) he began\nHis mistress’ picture; which by his tongue being made,\nAnd then a mind put in’t, either our brags\nWere crack’d of kitchen trulls, or his description\nProv’d us unspeaking sots.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNay, nay, to th’ purpose.\n\nIACHIMO.\nYour daughter’s chastity (there it begins)\nHe spake of her as Dian had hot dreams\nAnd she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,\nMade scruple of his praise, and wager’d with him\nPieces of gold ’gainst this which then he wore\nUpon his honour’d finger, to attain\nIn suit the place of’s bed, and win this ring\nBy hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,\nNo lesser of her honour confident\nThan I did truly find her, stakes this ring;\nAnd would so, had it been a carbuncle\nOf Phoebus’ wheel; and might so safely, had it\nBeen all the worth of’s car. Away to Britain\nPost I in this design. Well may you, sir,\nRemember me at court, where I was taught\nOf your chaste daughter the wide difference\n’Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench’d\nOf hope, not longing, mine Italian brain\nGan in your duller Britain operate\nMost vilely; for my vantage, excellent;\nAnd, to be brief, my practice so prevail’d\nThat I return’d with simular proof enough\nTo make the noble Leonatus mad,\nBy wounding his belief in her renown\nWith tokens thus and thus; averring notes\nOf chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet\n(O cunning, how I got it!) nay, some marks\nOf secret on her person, that he could not\nBut think her bond of chastity quite crack’d,\nI having ta’en the forfeit. Whereupon\nMethinks I see him now—\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\n[Coming forward.] Ay, so thou dost,\nItalian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,\nEgregious murderer, thief, anything\nThat’s due to all the villains past, in being,\nTo come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,\nSome upright justicer! Thou, King, send out\nFor torturers ingenious. It is I\nThat all th’ abhorred things o’ th’ earth amend\nBy being worse than they. I am Posthumus,\nThat kill’d thy daughter; villain-like, I lie;\nThat caus’d a lesser villain than myself,\nA sacrilegious thief, to do’t. The temple\nOf virtue was she; yea, and she herself.\nSpit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set\nThe dogs o’ th’ street to bay me. Every villain\nBe call’d Posthumus Leonatus, and\nBe villainy less than ’twas! O Imogen!\nMy queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,\nImogen, Imogen!\n\nIMOGEN.\nPeace, my lord. Hear, hear!\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nShall’s have a play of this? Thou scornful page,\nThere lies thy part.\n\n[Strikes her. She falls.]\n\nPISANIO.\nO gentlemen, help!\nMine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!\nYou ne’er kill’d Imogen till now. Help, help!\nMine honour’d lady!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nDoes the world go round?\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nHow comes these staggers on me?\n\nPISANIO.\nWake, my mistress!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nIf this be so, the gods do mean to strike me\nTo death with mortal joy.\n\nPISANIO.\nHow fares my mistress?\n\nIMOGEN.\nO, get thee from my sight;\nThou gav’st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence!\nBreathe not where princes are.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThe tune of Imogen!\n\nPISANIO.\nLady,\nThe gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if\nThat box I gave you was not thought by me\nA precious thing! I had it from the Queen.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNew matter still?\n\nIMOGEN.\nIt poison’d me.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nO gods!\nI left out one thing which the Queen confess’d,\nWhich must approve thee honest. ‘If Pisanio\nHave’ said she ‘given his mistress that confection\nWhich I gave him for cordial, she is serv’d\nAs I would serve a rat.’\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhat’s this, Cornelius?\n\nCORNELIUS.\nThe Queen, sir, very oft importun’d me\nTo temper poisons for her; still pretending\nThe satisfaction of her knowledge only\nIn killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,\nOf no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose\nWas of more danger, did compound for her\nA certain stuff, which, being ta’en would cease\nThe present pow’r of life, but in short time\nAll offices of nature should again\nDo their due functions. Have you ta’en of it?\n\nIMOGEN.\nMost like I did, for I was dead.\n\nBELARIUS.\nMy boys,\nThere was our error.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nThis is sure Fidele.\n\nIMOGEN.\nWhy did you throw your wedded lady from you?\nThink that you are upon a rock, and now\nThrow me again.\n\n[Embracing him.]\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nHang there like fruit, my soul,\nTill the tree die!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHow now, my flesh? my child?\nWhat, mak’st thou me a dullard in this act?\nWilt thou not speak to me?\n\nIMOGEN.\n[Kneeling.] Your blessing, sir.\n\nBELARIUS.\n[To Guiderius and Arviragus.] Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not;\nYou had a motive for’t.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMy tears that fall\nProve holy water on thee! Imogen,\nThy mother’s dead.\n\nIMOGEN.\nI am sorry for’t, my lord.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO, she was naught, and long of her it was\nThat we meet here so strangely; but her son\nIs gone, we know not how nor where.\n\nPISANIO.\nMy lord,\nNow fear is from me, I’ll speak troth. Lord Cloten,\nUpon my lady’s missing, came to me\nWith his sword drawn, foam’d at the mouth, and swore,\nIf I discover’d not which way she was gone,\nIt was my instant death. By accident\nI had a feigned letter of my master’s\nThen in my pocket, which directed him\nTo seek her on the mountains near to Milford;\nWhere, in a frenzy, in my master’s garments,\nWhich he enforc’d from me, away he posts\nWith unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate\nMy lady’s honour. What became of him\nI further know not.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nLet me end the story:\nI slew him there.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nMarry, the gods forfend!\nI would not thy good deeds should from my lips\nPluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,\nDeny’t again.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nI have spoke it, and I did it.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHe was a prince.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nA most incivil one. The wrongs he did me\nWere nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me\nWith language that would make me spurn the sea,\nIf it could so roar to me. I cut off’s head,\nAnd am right glad he is not standing here\nTo tell this tale of mine.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nI am sorry for thee.\nBy thine own tongue thou art condemn’d, and must\nEndure our law. Thou’rt dead.\n\nIMOGEN.\nThat headless man\nI thought had been my lord.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nBind the offender,\nAnd take him from our presence.\n\nBELARIUS.\nStay, sir King.\nThis man is better than the man he slew,\nAs well descended as thyself, and hath\nMore of thee merited than a band of Clotens\nHad ever scar for. [To the guard.] Let his arms alone;\nThey were not born for bondage.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhy, old soldier,\nWilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for\nBy tasting of our wrath? How of descent\nAs good as we?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nIn that he spake too far.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAnd thou shalt die for’t.\n\nBELARIUS.\nWe will die all three;\nBut I will prove that two on’s are as good\nAs I have given out him. My sons, I must\nFor mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,\nThough haply well for you.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nYour danger’s ours.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nAnd our good his.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHave at it then by leave!\nThou hadst, great King, a subject who\nWas call’d Belarius.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWhat of him? He is\nA banish’d traitor.\n\nBELARIUS.\nHe it is that hath\nAssum’d this age; indeed a banish’d man;\nI know not how a traitor.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nTake him hence,\nThe whole world shall not save him.\n\nBELARIUS.\nNot too hot.\nFirst pay me for the nursing of thy sons,\nAnd let it be confiscate all, so soon\nAs I have receiv’d it.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNursing of my sons?\n\nBELARIUS.\nI am too blunt and saucy: here’s my knee.\nEre I arise I will prefer my sons;\nThen spare not the old father. Mighty sir,\nThese two young gentlemen that call me father,\nAnd think they are my sons, are none of mine;\nThey are the issue of your loins, my liege,\nAnd blood of your begetting.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nHow? my issue?\n\nBELARIUS.\nSo sure as you your father’s. I, old Morgan,\nAm that Belarius whom you sometime banish’d.\nYour pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment\nItself, and all my treason; that I suffer’d\nWas all the harm I did. These gentle princes\n(For such and so they are) these twenty years\nHave I train’d up; those arts they have as I\nCould put into them. My breeding was, sir, as\nYour Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,\nWhom for the theft I wedded, stole these children\nUpon my banishment; I mov’d her to’t,\nHaving receiv’d the punishment before\nFor that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty\nExcited me to treason. Their dear loss,\nThe more of you ’twas felt, the more it shap’d\nUnto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,\nHere are your sons again, and I must lose\nTwo of the sweet’st companions in the world.\nThe benediction of these covering heavens\nFall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy\nTo inlay heaven with stars.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThou weep’st and speak’st.\nThe service that you three have done is more\nUnlike than this thou tell’st. I lost my children.\nIf these be they, I know not how to wish\nA pair of worthier sons.\n\nBELARIUS.\nBe pleas’d awhile.\nThis gentleman, whom I call Polydore,\nMost worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;\nThis gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,\nYour younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp’d\nIn a most curious mantle, wrought by th’ hand\nOf his queen mother, which for more probation\nI can with ease produce.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nGuiderius had\nUpon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;\nIt was a mark of wonder.\n\nBELARIUS.\nThis is he,\nWho hath upon him still that natural stamp.\nIt was wise nature’s end in the donation,\nTo be his evidence now.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO, what am I?\nA mother to the birth of three? Ne’er mother\nRejoic’d deliverance more. Blest pray you be,\nThat, after this strange starting from your orbs,\nYou may reign in them now! O Imogen,\nThou hast lost by this a kingdom.\n\nIMOGEN.\nNo, my lord;\nI have got two worlds by’t. O my gentle brothers,\nHave we thus met? O, never say hereafter\nBut I am truest speaker! You call’d me brother,\nWhen I was but your sister: I you brothers,\nWhen we were so indeed.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nDid you e’er meet?\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nGUIDERIUS.\nAnd at first meeting lov’d,\nContinu’d so until we thought he died.\n\nCORNELIUS.\nBy the Queen’s dram she swallow’d.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nO rare instinct!\nWhen shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement\nHath to it circumstantial branches, which\nDistinction should be rich in. Where? how liv’d you?\nAnd when came you to serve our Roman captive?\nHow parted with your brothers? how first met them?\nWhy fled you from the court? and whither? These,\nAnd your three motives to the battle, with\nI know not how much more, should be demanded,\nAnd all the other by-dependances,\nFrom chance to chance; but nor the time nor place\nWill serve our long interrogatories. See,\nPosthumus anchors upon Imogen;\nAnd she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye\nOn him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting\nEach object with a joy; the counterchange\nIs severally in all. Let’s quit this ground,\nAnd smoke the temple with our sacrifices.\n[To Belarius.] Thou art my brother; so we’ll hold thee ever.\n\nIMOGEN.\nYou are my father too, and did relieve me\nTo see this gracious season.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nAll o’erjoy’d\nSave these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,\nFor they shall taste our comfort.\n\nIMOGEN.\nMy good master,\nI will yet do you service.\n\nLUCIUS.\nHappy be you!\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThe forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,\nHe would have well becom’d this place and grac’d\nThe thankings of a king.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nI am, sir,\nThe soldier that did company these three\nIn poor beseeming; ’twas a fitment for\nThe purpose I then follow’d. That I was he,\nSpeak, Iachimo. I had you down, and might\nHave made you finish.\n\nIACHIMO.\n[Kneeling.] I am down again;\nBut now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,\nAs then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,\nWhich I so often owe; but your ring first,\nAnd here the bracelet of the truest princess\nThat ever swore her faith.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nKneel not to me.\nThe pow’r that I have on you is to spare you;\nThe malice towards you to forgive you. Live,\nAnd deal with others better.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nNobly doom’d!\nWe’ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;\nPardon’s the word to all.\n\nARVIRAGUS.\nYou holp us, sir,\nAs you did mean indeed to be our brother;\nJoy’d are we that you are.\n\nPOSTHUMUS.\nYour servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,\nCall forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought\nGreat Jupiter, upon his eagle back’d,\nAppear’d to me, with other spritely shows\nOf mine own kindred. When I wak’d, I found\nThis label on my bosom; whose containing\nIs so from sense in hardness that I can\nMake no collection of it. Let him show\nHis skill in the construction.\n\nLUCIUS.\nPhilarmonus!\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nHere, my good lord.\n\nLUCIUS.\nRead, and declare the meaning.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\n[Reads.] When as a lion’s whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embrac’d by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp’d branches which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.\nThou, Leonatus, art the lion’s whelp;\nThe fit and apt construction of thy name,\nBeing Leo-natus, doth import so much.\n[To Cymbeline] The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,\nWhich we call mollis aer, and mollis aer\nWe term it mulier; which mulier I divine\nIs this most constant wife, who even now\nAnswering the letter of the oracle,\nUnknown to you, unsought, were clipp’d about\nWith this most tender air.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nThis hath some seeming.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nThe lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,\nPersonates thee; and thy lopp’d branches point\nThy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol’n,\nFor many years thought dead, are now reviv’d,\nTo the majestic cedar join’d, whose issue\nPromises Britain peace and plenty.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nWell,\nMy peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,\nAlthough the victor, we submit to Cæsar\nAnd to the Roman empire, promising\nTo pay our wonted tribute, from the which\nWe were dissuaded by our wicked queen,\nWhom heavens in justice, both on her and hers,\nHave laid most heavy hand.\n\nSOOTHSAYER.\nThe fingers of the pow’rs above do tune\nThe harmony of this peace. The vision\nWhich I made known to Lucius ere the stroke\nOf yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant\nIs full accomplish’d; for the Roman eagle,\nFrom south to west on wing soaring aloft,\nLessen’d herself and in the beams o’ th’ sun\nSo vanish’d; which foreshow’d our princely eagle,\nTh’ imperial Cæsar, should again unite\nHis favour with the radiant Cymbeline,\nWhich shines here in the west.\n\nCYMBELINE.\nLaud we the gods;\nAnd let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\nFrom our bless’d altars. Publish we this peace\nTo all our subjects. Set we forward; let\nA Roman and a British ensign wave\nFriendly together. So through Lud’s Town march;\nAnd in the temple of great Jupiter\nOur peace we’ll ratify; seal it with feasts.\nSet on there! Never was a war did cease,\nEre bloody hands were wash’d, with such a peace.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
