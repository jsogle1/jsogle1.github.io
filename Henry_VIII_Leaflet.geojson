    "content":"ACT I\nPROLOGUE\nI come no more to make you laugh: things now,\nThat bear a weighty and a serious brow,\nSad, high, and working, full of state and woe,\nSuch noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,\nWe now present. Those that can pity, here\nMay, if they think it well, let fall a tear;\nThe subject will deserve it. Such as give\nTheir money out of hope they may believe,\nMay here find truth too. Those that come to see\nOnly a show or two, and so agree\nThe play may pass, if they be still and willing,\nI'll undertake may see away their shilling\nRichly in two short hours. Only they\nThat come to hear a merry bawdy play,\nA noise of targets, or to see a fellow\nIn a long motley coat guarded with yellow,\nWill be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,\nTo rank our chosen truth with such a show\nAs fool and fight is, beside forfeiting\nOur own brains, and the opinion that we bring,\nTo make that only true we now intend,\nWill leave us never an understanding friend.\nTherefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known\nThe first and happiest hearers of the town,\nBe sad, as we would make ye: think ye see\nThe very persons of our noble story\nAs they were living; think you see them great,\nAnd follow'd with the general throng and sweat\nOf thousand friends; then in a moment, see\nHow soon this mightiness meets misery:\nAnd, if you can be merry then, I'll say\nA man may weep upon his wedding-day.",

    "content":"SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.\nEnter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY\nBUCKINGHAM\nGood morrow, and well met. How have ye done\nSince last we saw in France?\nNORFOLK\nI thank your grace,\nHealthful; and ever since a fresh admirer\nOf what I saw there.\nBUCKINGHAM\nAn untimely ague\nStay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when\nThose suns of glory, those two lights of men,\nMet in the vale of Andren.\nNORFOLK\n'Twixt Guynes and Arde:\nI was then present, saw them salute on horseback;\nBeheld them, when they lighted, how they clung\nIn their embracement, as they grew together;\nWhich had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd\nSuch a compounded one?\nBUCKINGHAM\nAll the whole time\nI was my chamber's prisoner.\nNORFOLK\nThen you lost\nThe view of earthly glory: men might say,\nTill this time pomp was single, but now married\nTo one above itself. Each following day\nBecame the next day's master, till the last\nMade former wonders its. To-day the French,\nAll clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,\nShone down the English; and, to-morrow, they\nMade Britain India: every man that stood\nShow'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were\nAs cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,\nNot used to toil, did almost sweat to bear\nThe pride upon them, that their very labour\nWas to them as a painting: now this masque\nWas cried incomparable; and the ensuing night\nMade it a fool and beggar. The two kings,\nEqual in lustre, were now best, now worst,\nAs presence did present them; him in eye,\nStill him in praise: and, being present both\n'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner\nDurst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--\nFor so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged\nThe noble spirits to arms, they did perform\nBeyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,\nBeing now seen possible enough, got credit,\nThat Bevis was believed.\nBUCKINGHAM\nO, you go far.\nNORFOLK\nAs I belong to worship and affect\nIn honour honesty, the tract of every thing\nWould by a good discourser lose some life,\nWhich action's self was tongue to. All was royal;\nTo the disposing of it nought rebell'd.\nOrder gave each thing view; the office did\nDistinctly his full function.\nBUCKINGHAM\nWho did guide,\nI mean, who set the body and the limbs\nOf this great sport together, as you guess?\nNORFOLK\nOne, certes, that promises no element\nIn such a business.\nBUCKINGHAM\nI pray you, who, my lord?\nNORFOLK\nAll this was order'd by the good discretion\nOf the right reverend Cardinal of York.\nBUCKINGHAM\nThe devil speed him! no man's pie is freed\nFrom his ambitious finger. What had he\nTo do in these fierce vanities? I wonder\nThat such a keech can with his very bulk\nTake up the rays o' the beneficial sun\nAnd keep it from the earth.\nNORFOLK\nSurely, sir,\nThere's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;\nFor, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace\nChalks successors their way, nor call'd upon\nFor high feats done to the crown; neither allied\nFor eminent assistants; but, spider-like,\nOut of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,\nThe force of his own merit makes his way\nA gift that heaven gives for him, which buys\nA place next to the king.\nABERGAVENNY\nI cannot tell\nWhat heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye\nPierce into that; but I can see his pride\nPeep through each part of him: whence has he that,\nIf not from hell? the devil is a niggard,\nOr has given all before, and he begins\nA new hell in himself.\nBUCKINGHAM\nWhy the devil,\nUpon this French going out, took he upon him,\nWithout the privity o' the king, to appoint\nWho should attend on him? He makes up the file\nOf all the gentry; for the most part such\nTo whom as great a charge as little honour\nHe meant to lay upon: and his own letter,\nThe honourable board of council out,\nMust fetch him in the papers.\nABERGAVENNY\nI do know\nKinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have\nBy this so sickened their estates, that never\nThey shall abound as formerly.\nBUCKINGHAM\nO, many\nHave broke their backs with laying manors on 'em\nFor this great journey. What did this vanity\nBut minister communication of\nA most poor issue?\nNORFOLK\nGrievingly I think,\nThe peace between the French and us not values\nThe cost that did conclude it.\nBUCKINGHAM\nEvery man,\nAfter the hideous storm that follow'd, was\nA thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke\nInto a general prophecy; That this tempest,\nDashing the garment of this peace, aboded\nThe sudden breach on't.\nNORFOLK\nWhich is budded out;\nFor France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd\nOur merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.\nABERGAVENNY\nIs it therefore\nThe ambassador is silenced?\nNORFOLK\nMarry, is't.\nABERGAVENNY\nA proper title of a peace; and purchased\nAt a superfluous rate!\nBUCKINGHAM\nWhy, all this business\nOur reverend cardinal carried.\nNORFOLK\nLike it your grace,\nThe state takes notice of the private difference\nBetwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--\nAnd take it from a heart that wishes towards you\nHonour and plenteous safety--that you read\nThe cardinal's malice and his potency\nTogether; to consider further that\nWhat his high hatred would effect wants not\nA minister in his power. You know his nature,\nThat he's revengeful, and I know his sword\nHath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,\nIt reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,\nThither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,\nYou'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock\nThat I advise your shunning.\nEnter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him, certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain\n\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nThe Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?\nWhere's his examination?\nFirst Secretary\nHere, so please you.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nIs he in person ready?\nFirst Secretary\nAy, please your grace.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nWell, we shall then know more; and Buckingham\nShall lessen this big look.\nExeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train\n\nBUCKINGHAM\nThis butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I\nHave not the power to muzzle him; therefore best\nNot wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book\nOutworths a noble's blood.\nNORFOLK\nWhat, are you chafed?\nAsk God for temperance; that's the appliance only\nWhich your disease requires.\nBUCKINGHAM\nI read in's looks\nMatter against me; and his eye reviled\nMe, as his abject object: at this instant\nHe bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;\nI'll follow and outstare him.\nNORFOLK\nStay, my lord,\nAnd let your reason with your choler question\nWhat 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills\nRequires slow pace at first: anger is like\nA full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,\nSelf-mettle tires him. Not a man in England\nCan advise me like you: be to yourself\nAs you would to your friend.\nBUCKINGHAM\nI'll to the king;\nAnd from a mouth of honour quite cry down\nThis Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim\nThere's difference in no persons.\nNORFOLK\nBe advised;\nHeat not a furnace for your foe so hot\nThat it do singe yourself: we may outrun,\nBy violent swiftness, that which we run at,\nAnd lose by over-running. Know you not,\nThe fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,\nIn seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:\nI say again, there is no English soul\nMore stronger to direct you than yourself,\nIf with the sap of reason you would quench,\nOr but allay, the fire of passion.\nBUCKINGHAM\nSir,\nI am thankful to you; and I'll go along\nBy your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,\nWhom from the flow of gall I name not but\nFrom sincere motions, by intelligence,\nAnd proofs as clear as founts in July when\nWe see each grain of gravel, I do know\nTo be corrupt and treasonous.\nNORFOLK\nSay not 'treasonous.'\nBUCKINGHAM\nTo the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong\nAs shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,\nOr wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous\nAs he is subtle, and as prone to mischief\nAs able to perform't; his mind and place\nInfecting one another, yea, reciprocally--\nOnly to show his pomp as well in France\nAs here at home, suggests the king our master\nTo this last costly treaty, the interview,\nThat swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass\nDid break i' the rinsing.\nNORFOLK\nFaith, and so it did.\nBUCKINGHAM\nPray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal\nThe articles o' the combination drew\nAs himself pleased; and they were ratified\nAs he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end\nAs give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal\nHas done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,\nWho cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--\nWhich, as I take it, is a kind of puppy\nTo the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,\nUnder pretence to see the queen his aunt--\nFor 'twas indeed his colour, but he came\nTo whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:\nHis fears were, that the interview betwixt\nEngland and France might, through their amity,\nBreed him some prejudice; for from this league\nPeep'd harms that menaced him: he privily\nDeals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--\nWhich I do well; for I am sure the emperor\nPaid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted\nEre it was ask'd; but when the way was made,\nAnd paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,\nThat he would please to alter the king's course,\nAnd break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,\nAs soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal\nDoes buy and sell his honour as he pleases,\nAnd for his own advantage.\nNORFOLK\nI am sorry\nTo hear this of him; and could wish he were\nSomething mistaken in't.\nBUCKINGHAM\nNo, not a syllable:\nI do pronounce him in that very shape\nHe shall appear in proof.\nEnter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the Guard\n\nBRANDON\nYour office, sergeant; execute it.\nSergeant\nSir,\nMy lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl\nOf Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I\nArrest thee of high treason, in the name\nOf our most sovereign king.\nBUCKINGHAM\nLo, you, my lord,\nThe net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish\nUnder device and practise.\nBRANDON\nI am sorry\nTo see you ta'en from liberty, to look on\nThe business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure\nYou shall to the Tower.\nBUCKINGHAM\nIt will help me nothing\nTo plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me\nWhich makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven\nBe done in this and all things! I obey.\nO my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!\nBRANDON\nNay, he must bear you company. The king\nTo ABERGAVENNY\n\nIs pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know\nHow he determines further.\nABERGAVENNY\nAs the duke said,\nThe will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure\nBy me obey'd!\nBRANDON\nHere is a warrant from\nThe king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies\nOf the duke's confessor, John de la Car,\nOne Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--\nBUCKINGHAM\nSo, so;\nThese are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.\nBRANDON\nA monk o' the Chartreux.\nBUCKINGHAM\nO, Nicholas Hopkins?\nBRANDON\nHe.\nBUCKINGHAM\nMy surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal\nHath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:\nI am the shadow of poor Buckingham,\nWhose figure even this instant cloud puts on,\nBy darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.\nExeunt",

    "content":"SCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.\nCornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL; CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right side\nKING HENRY VIII\nMy life itself, and the best heart of it,\nThanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level\nOf a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks\nTo you that choked it. Let be call'd before us\nThat gentleman of Buckingham's; in person\nI'll hear him his confessions justify;\nAnd point by point the treasons of his master\nHe shall again relate.\nA noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK: she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him\n\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nNay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.\nKING HENRY VIII\nArise, and take place by us: half your suit\nNever name to us; you have half our power:\nThe other moiety, ere you ask, is given;\nRepeat your will and take it.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nThank your majesty.\nThat you would love yourself, and in that love\nNot unconsider'd leave your honour, nor\nThe dignity of your office, is the point\nOf my petition.\nKING HENRY VIII\nLady mine, proceed.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nI am solicited, not by a few,\nAnd those of true condition, that your subjects\nAre in great grievance: there have been commissions\nSent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart\nOf all their loyalties: wherein, although,\nMy good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches\nMost bitterly on you, as putter on\nOf these exactions, yet the king our master--\nWhose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he\nescapes not\nLanguage unmannerly, yea, such which breaks\nThe sides of loyalty, and almost appears\nIn loud rebellion.\nNORFOLK\nNot almost appears,\nIt doth appear; for, upon these taxations,\nThe clothiers all, not able to maintain\nThe many to them longing, have put off\nThe spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,\nUnfit for other life, compell'd by hunger\nAnd lack of other means, in desperate manner\nDaring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,\nAnd danger serves among then!\nKING HENRY VIII\nTaxation!\nWherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,\nYou that are blamed for it alike with us,\nKnow you of this taxation?\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nPlease you, sir,\nI know but of a single part, in aught\nPertains to the state; and front but in that file\nWhere others tell steps with me.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nNo, my lord,\nYou know no more than others; but you frame\nThings that are known alike; which are not wholesome\nTo those which would not know them, and yet must\nPerforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,\nWhereof my sovereign would have note, they are\nMost pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,\nThe back is sacrifice to the load. They say\nThey are devised by you; or else you suffer\nToo hard an exclamation.\nKING HENRY VIII\nStill exaction!\nThe nature of it? in what kind, let's know,\nIs this exaction?\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nI am much too venturous\nIn tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd\nUnder your promised pardon. The subjects' grief\nComes through commissions, which compel from each\nThe sixth part of his substance, to be levied\nWithout delay; and the pretence for this\nIs named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:\nTongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze\nAllegiance in them; their curses now\nLive where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,\nThis tractable obedience is a slave\nTo each incensed will. I would your highness\nWould give it quick consideration, for\nThere is no primer business.\nKING HENRY VIII\nBy my life,\nThis is against our pleasure.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nAnd for me,\nI have no further gone in this than by\nA single voice; and that not pass'd me but\nBy learned approbation of the judges. If I am\nTraduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know\nMy faculties nor person, yet will be\nThe chronicles of my doing, let me say\n'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake\nThat virtue must go through. We must not stint\nOur necessary actions, in the fear\nTo cope malicious censurers; which ever,\nAs ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow\nThat is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further\nThan vainly longing. What we oft do best,\nBy sick interpreters, once weak ones, is\nNot ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,\nHitting a grosser quality, is cried up\nFor our best act. If we shall stand still,\nIn fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,\nWe should take root here where we sit, or sit\nState-statues only.\nKING HENRY VIII\nThings done well,\nAnd with a care, exempt themselves from fear;\nThings done without example, in their issue\nAre to be fear'd. Have you a precedent\nOf this commission? I believe, not any.\nWe must not rend our subjects from our laws,\nAnd stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?\nA trembling contribution! Why, we take\nFrom every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;\nAnd, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,\nThe air will drink the sap. To every county\nWhere this is question'd send our letters, with\nFree pardon to each man that has denied\nThe force of this commission: pray, look to't;\nI put it to your care.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nA word with you.\nTo the Secretary\n\nLet there be letters writ to every shire,\nOf the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons\nHardly conceive of me; let it be noised\nThat through our intercession this revokement\nAnd pardon comes: I shall anon advise you\nFurther in the proceeding.\nExit Secretary\n\nEnter Surveyor\n\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nI am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham\nIs run in your displeasure.\nKING HENRY VIII\nIt grieves many:\nThe gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;\nTo nature none more bound; his training such,\nThat he may furnish and instruct great teachers,\nAnd never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,\nWhen these so noble benefits shall prove\nNot well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,\nThey turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly\nThan ever they were fair. This man so complete,\nWho was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,\nAlmost with ravish'd listening, could not find\nHis hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,\nHath into monstrous habits put the graces\nThat once were his, and is become as black\nAs if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--\nThis was his gentleman in trust--of him\nThings to strike honour sad. Bid him recount\nThe fore-recited practises; whereof\nWe cannot feel too little, hear too much.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nStand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,\nMost like a careful subject, have collected\nOut of the Duke of Buckingham.\nKING HENRY VIII\nSpeak freely.\nSurveyor\nFirst, it was usual with him, every day\nIt would infect his speech, that if the king\nShould without issue die, he'll carry it so\nTo make the sceptre his: these very words\nI've heard him utter to his son-in-law,\nLord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced\nRevenge upon the cardinal.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nPlease your highness, note\nThis dangerous conception in this point.\nNot friended by by his wish, to your high person\nHis will is most malignant; and it stretches\nBeyond you, to your friends.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nMy learn'd lord cardinal,\nDeliver all with charity.\nKING HENRY VIII\nSpeak on:\nHow grounded he his title to the crown,\nUpon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him\nAt any time speak aught?\nSurveyor\nHe was brought to this\nBy a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.\nKING HENRY VIII\nWhat was that Hopkins?\nSurveyor\nSir, a Chartreux friar,\nHis confessor, who fed him every minute\nWith words of sovereignty.\nKING HENRY VIII\nHow know'st thou this?\nSurveyor\nNot long before your highness sped to France,\nThe duke being at the Rose, within the parish\nSaint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand\nWhat was the speech among the Londoners\nConcerning the French journey: I replied,\nMen fear'd the French would prove perfidious,\nTo the king's danger. Presently the duke\nSaid, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted\n'Twould prove the verity of certain words\nSpoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,\n'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit\nJohn de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour\nTo hear from him a matter of some moment:\nWhom after under the confession's seal\nHe solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke\nMy chaplain to no creature living, but\nTo me, should utter, with demure confidence\nThis pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,\nTell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive\nTo gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke\nShall govern England.'\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nIf I know you well,\nYou were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office\nOn the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed\nYou charge not in your spleen a noble person\nAnd spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;\nYes, heartily beseech you.\nKING HENRY VIII\nLet him on.\nGo forward.\nSurveyor\nOn my soul, I'll speak but truth.\nI told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions\nThe monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him\nTo ruminate on this so far, until\nIt forged him some design, which, being believed,\nIt was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,\nIt can do me no damage;' adding further,\nThat, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,\nThe cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads\nShould have gone off.\nKING HENRY VIII\nHa! what, so rank? Ah ha!\nThere's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?\nSurveyor\nI can, my liege.\nKING HENRY VIII\nProceed.\nSurveyor\nBeing at Greenwich,\nAfter your highness had reproved the duke\nAbout Sir William Blomer,--\nKING HENRY VIII\nI remember\nOf such a time: being my sworn servant,\nThe duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?\nSurveyor\n'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,\nAs, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd\nThe part my father meant to act upon\nThe usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,\nMade suit to come in's presence; which if granted,\nAs he made semblance of his duty, would\nHave put his knife to him.'\nKING HENRY VIII\nA giant traitor!\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nNow, madam, may his highness live in freedom,\nand this man out of prison?\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nGod mend all!\nKING HENRY VIII\nThere's something more would out of thee; what say'st?\nSurveyor\nAfter 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'\nHe stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,\nAnother spread on's breast, mounting his eyes\nHe did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor\nWas,--were he evil used, he would outgo\nHis father by as much as a performance\nDoes an irresolute purpose.\nKING HENRY VIII\nThere's his period,\nTo sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;\nCall him to present trial: if he may\nFind mercy in the law, 'tis his: if none,\nLet him not seek 't of us: by day and night,\nHe's traitor to the height.\nExeunt",

A street.\nEnter two Gentlemen, meeting\nFirst Gentleman\nWhither away so fast?\nSecond Gentleman\nO, God save ye!\nEven to the hall, to hear what shall become\nOf the great Duke of Buckingham.\nFirst Gentleman\nI'll save you\nThat labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony\nOf bringing back the prisoner.\nSecond Gentleman\nWere you there?\nFirst Gentleman\nYes, indeed, was I.\nSecond Gentleman\nPray, speak what has happen'd.\nFirst Gentleman\nYou may guess quickly what.\nSecond Gentleman\nIs he found guilty?\nFirst Gentleman\nYes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.\nSecond Gentleman\nI am sorry for't.\nFirst Gentleman\nSo are a number more.\nSecond Gentleman\nBut, pray, how pass'd it?\nFirst Gentleman\nI'll tell you in a little. The great duke\nCame to the bar; where to his accusations\nHe pleaded still not guilty and alleged\nMany sharp reasons to defeat the law.\nThe king's attorney on the contrary\nUrged on the examinations, proofs, confessions\nOf divers witnesses; which the duke desired\nTo have brought viva voce to his face:\nAt which appear'd against him his surveyor;\nSir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,\nConfessor to him; with that devil-monk,\nHopkins, that made this mischief.\nSecond Gentleman\nThat was he\nThat fed him with his prophecies?\nFirst Gentleman\nThe same.\nAll these accused him strongly; which he fain\nWould have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:\nAnd so his peers, upon this evidence,\nHave found him guilty of high treason. Much\nHe spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all\nWas either pitied in him or forgotten.\nSecond Gentleman\nAfter all this, how did he bear himself?\nFirst Gentleman\nWhen he was brought again to the bar, to hear\nHis knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd\nWith such an agony, he sweat extremely,\nAnd something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:\nBut he fell to himself again, and sweetly\nIn all the rest show'd a most noble patience.\nSecond Gentleman\nI do not think he fears death.\nFirst Gentleman\nSure, he does not:\nHe never was so womanish; the cause\nHe may a little grieve at.\nSecond Gentleman\nCertainly\nThe cardinal is the end of this.\nFirst Gentleman\n'Tis likely,\nBy all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,\nThen deputy of Ireland; who removed,\nEarl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,\nLest he should help his father.\nSecond Gentleman\nThat trick of state\nWas a deep envious one.\nFirst Gentleman\nAt his return\nNo doubt he will requite it. This is noted,\nAnd generally, whoever the king favours,\nThe cardinal instantly will find employment,\nAnd far enough from court too.\nSecond Gentleman\nAll the commons\nHate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,\nWish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much\nThey love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,\nThe mirror of all courtesy;--\nFirst Gentleman\nStay there, sir,\nAnd see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.\nEnter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL, VAUX, SANDS, and common people\n\nSecond Gentleman\nLet's stand close, and behold him.\nBUCKINGHAM\nAll good people,\nYou that thus far have come to pity me,\nHear what I say, and then go home and lose me.\nI have this day received a traitor's judgment,\nAnd by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,\nAnd if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,\nEven as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!\nThe law I bear no malice for my death;\n'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:\nBut those that sought it I could wish more Christians:\nBe what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:\nYet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,\nNor build their evils on the graves of great men;\nFor then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.\nFor further life in this world I ne'er hope,\nNor will I sue, although the king have mercies\nMore than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,\nAnd dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,\nHis noble friends and fellows, whom to leave\nIs only bitter to him, only dying,\nGo with me, like good angels, to my end;\nAnd, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,\nMake of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,\nAnd lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.\nLOVELL\nI do beseech your grace, for charity,\nIf ever any malice in your heart\nWere hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.\nBUCKINGHAM\nSir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you\nAs I would be forgiven: I forgive all;\nThere cannot be those numberless offences\n'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:\nno black envy\nShall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;\nAnd if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him\nYou met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers\nYet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,\nShall cry for blessings on him: may he live\nLonger than I have time to tell his years!\nEver beloved and loving may his rule be!\nAnd when old time shall lead him to his end,\nGoodness and he fill up one monument!\nLOVELL\nTo the water side I must conduct your grace;\nThen give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,\nWho undertakes you to your end.\nVAUX\nPrepare there,\nThe duke is coming: see the barge be ready;\nAnd fit it with such furniture as suits\nThe greatness of his person.\nBUCKINGHAM\nNay, Sir Nicholas,\nLet it alone; my state now will but mock me.\nWhen I came hither, I was lord high constable\nAnd Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:\nYet I am richer than my base accusers,\nThat never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;\nAnd with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.\nMy noble father, Henry of Buckingham,\nWho first raised head against usurping Richard,\nFlying for succor to his servant Banister,\nBeing distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,\nAnd without trial fell; God's peace be with him!\nHenry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying\nMy father's loss, like a most royal prince,\nRestored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,\nMade my name once more noble. Now his son,\nHenry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all\nThat made me happy at one stroke has taken\nFor ever from the world. I had my trial,\nAnd, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,\nA little happier than my wretched father:\nYet thus far we are one in fortunes: both\nFell by our servants, by those men we loved most;\nA most unnatural and faithless service!\nHeaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,\nThis from a dying man receive as certain:\nWhere you are liberal of your loves and counsels\nBe sure you be not loose; for those you make friends\nAnd give your hearts to, when they once perceive\nThe least rub in your fortunes, fall away\nLike water from ye, never found again\nBut where they mean to sink ye. All good people,\nPray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour\nOf my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:\nAnd when you would say something that is sad,\nSpeak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!\nExeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train\n\nFirst Gentleman\nO, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,\nI fear, too many curses on their beads\nThat were the authors.\nSecond Gentleman\nIf the duke be guiltless,\n'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling\nOf an ensuing evil, if it fall,\nGreater than this.\nFirst Gentleman\nGood angels keep it from us!\nWhat may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?\nSecond Gentleman\nThis secret is so weighty, 'twill require\nA strong faith to conceal it.\nFirst Gentleman\nLet me have it;\nI do not talk much.\nSecond Gentleman\nI am confident,\nYou shall, sir: did you not of late days hear\nA buzzing of a separation\nBetween the king and Katharine?\nFirst Gentleman\nYes, but it held not:\nFor when the king once heard it, out of anger\nHe sent command to the lord mayor straight\nTo stop the rumor, and allay those tongues\nThat durst disperse it.\nSecond Gentleman\nBut that slander, sir,\nIs found a truth now: for it grows again\nFresher than e'er it was; and held for certain\nThe king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,\nOr some about him near, have, out of malice\nTo the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple\nThat will undo her: to confirm this too,\nCardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;\nAs all think, for this business.\nFirst Gentleman\n'Tis the cardinal;\nAnd merely to revenge him on the emperor\nFor not bestowing on him, at his asking,\nThe archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.\nSecond Gentleman\nI think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel\nThat she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal\nWill have his will, and she must fall.\nFirst Gentleman\n'Tis woful.\nWe are too open here to argue this;\nLet's think in private more.\nExeunt",

They were young and handsome, and of the\nbest breed in the north. When they were ready to\nset out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by\ncommission and main power, took 'em from me; with\nthis reason: His master would be served before a\nsubject, if not before the king; which stopped our\nmouths, sir.'\nI fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:\nHe will have all, I think.\nEnter, to Chamberlain, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK\n\nNORFOLK\nWell met, my lord chamberlain.\nChamberlain\nGood day to both your graces.\nSUFFOLK\nHow is the king employ'd?\nChamberlain\nI left him private,\nFull of sad thoughts and troubles.\nNORFOLK\nWhat's the cause?\nChamberlain\nIt seems the marriage with his brother's wife\nHas crept too near his conscience.\nSUFFOLK\nNo, his conscience\nHas crept too near another lady.\nNORFOLK\n'Tis so:\nThis is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:\nThat blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,\nTurns what he list. The king will know him one day.\nSUFFOLK\nPray God he do! he'll never know himself else.\nNORFOLK\nHow holily he works in all his business!\nAnd with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league\nBetween us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,\nHe dives into the king's soul, and there scatters\nDangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,\nFears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:\nAnd out of all these to restore the king,\nHe counsels a divorce; a loss of her\nThat, like a jewel, has hung twenty years\nAbout his neck, yet never lost her lustre;\nOf her that loves him with that excellence\nThat angels love good men with; even of her\nThat, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,\nWill bless the king: and is not this course pious?\nChamberlain\nHeaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true\nThese news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,\nAnd every true heart weeps for't: all that dare\nLook into these affairs see this main end,\nThe French king's sister. Heaven will one day open\nThe king's eyes, that so long have slept upon\nThis bold bad man.\nSUFFOLK\nAnd free us from his slavery.\nNORFOLK\nWe had need pray,\nAnd heartily, for our deliverance;\nOr this imperious man will work us all\nFrom princes into pages: all men's honours\nLie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd\nInto what pitch he please.\nSUFFOLK\nFor me, my lords,\nI love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:\nAs I am made without him, so I'll stand,\nIf the king please; his curses and his blessings\nTouch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.\nI knew him, and I know him; so I leave him\nTo him that made him proud, the pope.\nNORFOLK\nLet's in;\nAnd with some other business put the king\nFrom these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:\nMy lord, you'll bear us company?\nChamberlain\nExcuse me;\nThe king has sent me otherwhere: besides,\nYou'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:\nHealth to your lordships.\nNORFOLK\nThanks, my good lord chamberlain.\nExit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain, and sits reading pensively\n\nSUFFOLK\nHow sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.\nKING HENRY VIII\nWho's there, ha?\nNORFOLK\nPray God he be not angry.\nKING HENRY VIII\nWho's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves\nInto my private meditations?\nWho am I? ha?\nNORFOLK\nA gracious king that pardons all offences\nMalice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way\nIs business of estate; in which we come\nTo know your royal pleasure.\nKING HENRY VIII\nYe are too bold:\nGo to; I'll make ye know your times of business:\nIs this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?\nEnter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS, with a commission\n\nWho's there? my good lord cardinal?

All the clerks,\nI mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms\nHave their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,\nInvited by your noble self, hath sent\nOne general tongue unto us, this good man,\nThis just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;\nWhom once more I present unto your highness.\nKING HENRY VIII\nAnd once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,\nAnd thank the holy conclave for their loves:\nThey have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.\nCARDINAL CAMPEIUS\nYour grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,\nYou are so noble. To your highness' hand\nI tender my commission; by whose virtue,\nThe court of Rome commanding, you, my lord\nCardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant\nIn the unpartial judging of this business.\nKING HENRY VIII\nTwo equal men.

He was a fool;\nFor he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,\nIf I command him, follows my appointment:\nI will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,\nWe live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.\nKING HENRY VIII\nDeliver this with modesty to the queen.\nExit GARDINER\n\nThe most convenient place that I can think of\nFor such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;\nThere ye shall meet about this weighty business.\nMy Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,\nWould it not grieve an able man to leave\nSo sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!\nO, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.\nExeunt",

    "content":"SCENE III. An ante-chamber of the QUEEN'S apartments.\nEnter ANNE and an Old Lady\nANNE\nNot for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:\nHis highness having lived so long with her, and she\nSo good a lady that no tongue could ever\nPronounce dishonour of her; by my life,\nShe never knew harm-doing: O, now, after\nSo many courses of the sun enthroned,\nStill growing in a majesty and pomp, the which\nTo leave a thousand-fold more bitter than\n'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,\nTo give her the avaunt! it is a pity\nWould move a monster.\nOld Lady\nHearts of most hard temper\nMelt and lament for her.\nANNE\nO, God's will! much better\nShe ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,\nYet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce\nIt from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging\nAs soul and body's severing.\nOld Lady\nAlas, poor lady!\nShe's a stranger now again.\nANNE\nSo much the more\nMust pity drop upon her. Verily,\nI swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,\nAnd range with humble livers in content,\nThan to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,\nAnd wear a golden sorrow.\nOld Lady\nOur content\nIs our best having.\nANNE\nBy my troth and maidenhead,\nI would not be a queen.\nOld Lady\nBeshrew me, I would,\nAnd venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,\nFor all this spice of your hypocrisy:\nYou, that have so fair parts of woman on you,\nHave too a woman's heart; which ever yet\nAffected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;\nWhich, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,\nSaving your mincing, the capacity\nOf your soft cheveril conscience would receive,\nIf you might please to stretch it.\nANNE\nNay, good troth.\nOld Lady\nYes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?\nANNE\nNo, not for all the riches under heaven.\nOld Lady: 'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,\nOld as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,\nWhat think you of a duchess? have you limbs\nTo bear that load of title?\nANNE\nNo, in truth.\nOld Lady\nThen you are weakly made: pluck off a little;\nI would not be a young count in your way,\nFor more than blushing comes to: if your back\nCannot vouchsafe this burthen,'tis too weak\nEver to get a boy.\nANNE\nHow you do talk!\nI swear again, I would not be a queen\nFor all the world.\nOld Lady\nIn faith, for little England\nYou'ld venture an emballing: I myself\nWould for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd\nNo more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?\nEnter Chamberlain\n\nChamberlain\nGood morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know\nThe secret of your conference?\nANNE\nMy good lord,\nNot your demand; it values not your asking:\nOur mistress' sorrows we were pitying.\nChamberlain\nIt was a gentle business, and becoming\nThe action of good women: there is hope\nAll will be well.\nANNE\nNow, I pray God, amen!\nChamberlain\nYou bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings\nFollow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,\nPerceive I speak sincerely, and high note's\nTa'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty\nCommends his good opinion of you, and\nDoes purpose honour to you no less flowing\nThan Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title\nA thousand pound a year, annual support,\nOut of his grace he adds.\nANNE\nI do not know\nWhat kind of my obedience I should tender;\nMore than my all is nothing: nor my prayers\nAre not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes\nMore worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes\nAre all I can return. Beseech your lordship,\nVouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,\nAs from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;\nWhose health and royalty I pray for.\nChamberlain\nLady,\nI shall not fail to approve the fair conceit\nThe king hath of you.\nAside\n\nI have perused her well;\nBeauty and honour in her are so mingled\nThat they have caught the king: and who knows yet\nBut from this lady may proceed a gem\nTo lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,\nAnd say I spoke with you.\nExit Chamberlain\n\nANNE\nMy honour'd lord.\nOld Lady\nWhy, this it is; see, see!\nI have been begging sixteen years in court,\nAm yet a courtier beggarly, nor could\nCome pat betwixt too early and too late\nFor any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!\nA very fresh-fish here--fie, fie, fie upon\nThis compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up\nBefore you open it.\nANNE\nThis is strange to me.\nOld Lady\nHow tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.\nThere was a lady once, 'tis an old story,\nThat would not be a queen, that would she not,\nFor all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?\nANNE\nCome, you are pleasant.\nOld Lady\nWith your theme, I could\nO'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!\nA thousand pounds a year for pure respect!\nNo other obligation! By my life,\nThat promises moe thousands: honour's train\nIs longer than his foreskirt. By this time\nI know your back will bear a duchess: say,\nAre you not stronger than you were?\nANNE\nGood lady,\nMake yourself mirth with your particular fancy,\nAnd leave me out on't. Would I had no being,\nIf this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,\nTo think what follows.\nThe queen is comfortless, and we forgetful\nIn our long absence: pray, do not deliver\nWhat here you've heard to her.\nOld Lady\nWhat do you think me?\nExeunt",

    "content":"SCENE IV. A hall in Black-Friars.\nTrumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two Vergers, with short silver wands; next them, two Scribes, in the habit of doctors; after them, CANTERBURY alone; after him, LINCOLN, Ely, Rochester, and Saint Asaph; next them, with some small distance, follows a Gentleman bearing the purse, with the great seal, and a cardinal's hat; then two Priests, bearing each a silver cross; then a Gentleman-usher bare-headed, accompanied with a Sergeant-at-arms bearing a silver mace; then two Gentlemen bearing two great silver pillars; after them, side by side, CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS; two Noblemen with the sword and mace. KING HENRY VIII takes place under the cloth of state; CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS sit under him as judges. QUEEN KATHARINE takes place some distance from KING HENRY VIII. The Bishops place themselves on each side the court, in manner of a consistory; below them, the Scribes. The Lords sit next the Bishops. The rest of the Attendants stand in convenient order about the stage\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nWhilst our commission from Rome is read,\nLet silence be commanded.\nKING HENRY VIII\nWhat's the need?\nIt hath already publicly been read,\nAnd on all sides the authority allow'd;\nYou may, then, spare that time.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nBe't so. Proceed.\nScribe\nSay, Henry King of England, come into the court.\nCrier\nHenry King of England, & c.\nKING HENRY VIII\nHere.\nScribe\nSay, Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.\nCrier\nKatharine Queen of England, & c.\nQUEEN KATHARINE makes no answer, rises out of her chair, goes about the court, comes to KING HENRY VIII, and kneels at his feet; then speaks\n\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nSir, I desire you do me right and justice;\nAnd to bestow your pity on me: for\nI am a most poor woman, and a stranger,\nBorn out of your dominions; having here\nNo judge indifferent, nor no more assurance\nOf equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,\nIn what have I offended you? what cause\nHath my behavior given to your displeasure,\nThat thus you should proceed to put me off,\nAnd take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,\nI have been to you a true and humble wife,\nAt all times to your will conformable;\nEver in fear to kindle your dislike,\nYea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry\nAs I saw it inclined: when was the hour\nI ever contradicted your desire,\nOr made it not mine too? Or which of your friends\nHave I not strove to love, although I knew\nHe were mine enemy? what friend of mine\nThat had to him derived your anger, did I\nContinue in my liking? nay, gave notice\nHe was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind\nThat I have been your wife, in this obedience,\nUpward of twenty years, and have been blest\nWith many children by you: if, in the course\nAnd process of this time, you can report,\nAnd prove it too, against mine honour aught,\nMy bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,\nAgainst your sacred person, in God's name,\nTurn me away; and let the foul'st contempt\nShut door upon me, and so give me up\nTo the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,\nThe king, your father, was reputed for\nA prince most prudent, of an excellent\nAnd unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,\nMy father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one\nThe wisest prince that there had reign'd by many\nA year before: it is not to be question'd\nThat they had gather'd a wise council to them\nOf every realm, that did debate this business,\nWho deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly\nBeseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may\nBe by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel\nI will implore: if not, i' the name of God,\nYour pleasure be fulfill'd!\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nYou have here, lady,\nAnd of your choice, these reverend fathers; men\nOf singular integrity and learning,\nYea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled\nTo plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless\nThat longer you desire the court; as well\nFor your own quiet, as to rectify\nWhat is unsettled in the king.\nCARDINAL CAMPEIUS\nHis grace\nHath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,\nIt's fit this royal session do proceed;\nAnd that, without delay, their arguments\nBe now produced and heard.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nLord cardinal,\nTo you I speak.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nYour pleasure, madam?\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nSir,\nI am about to weep; but, thinking that\nWe are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain\nThe daughter of a king, my drops of tears\nI'll turn to sparks of fire.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nBe patient yet.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nI will, when you are humble; nay, before,\nOr God will punish me. I do believe,\nInduced by potent circumstances, that\nYou are mine enemy, and make my challenge\nYou shall not be my judge: for it is you\nHave blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;\nWhich God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,\nI utterly abhor, yea, from my soul\nRefuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,\nI hold my most malicious foe, and think not\nAt all a friend to truth.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nI do profess\nYou speak not like yourself; who ever yet\nHave stood to charity, and display'd the effects\nOf disposition gentle, and of wisdom\nO'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:\nI have no spleen against you; nor injustice\nFor you or any: how far I have proceeded,\nOr how far further shall, is warranted\nBy a commission from the consistory,\nYea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me\nThat I have blown this coal: I do deny it:\nThe king is present: if it be known to him\nThat I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,\nAnd worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much\nAs you have done my truth. If he know\nThat I am free of your report, he knows\nI am not of your wrong. Therefore in him\nIt lies to cure me: and the cure is, to\nRemove these thoughts from you: the which before\nHis highness shall speak in, I do beseech\nYou, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking\nAnd to say so no more.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nMy lord, my lord,\nI am a simple woman, much too weak\nTo oppose your cunning. You're meek and\nhumble-mouth'd;\nYou sign your place and calling, in full seeming,\nWith meekness and humility; but your heart\nIs cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.\nYou have, by fortune and his highness' favours,\nGone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted\nWhere powers are your retainers, and your words,\nDomestics to you, serve your will as't please\nYourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,\nYou tender more your person's honour than\nYour high profession spiritual: that again\nI do refuse you for my judge; and here,\nBefore you all, appeal unto the pope,\nTo bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,\nAnd to be judged by him.\nShe curtsies to KING HENRY VIII, and offers to depart\n\nCARDINAL CAMPEIUS\nThe queen is obstinate,\nStubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and\nDisdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.\nShe's going away.\nKING HENRY VIII\nCall her again.\nCrier\nKatharine Queen of England, come into the court.\nGRIFFITH\nMadam, you are call'd back.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nWhat need you note it? pray you, keep your way:\nWhen you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,\nThey vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:\nI will not tarry; no, nor ever more\nUpon this business my appearance make\nIn any of their courts.\nExeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her Attendants\n\nKING HENRY VIII\nGo thy ways, Kate:\nThat man i' the world who shall report he has\nA better wife, let him in nought be trusted,\nFor speaking false in that: thou art, alone,\nIf thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,\nThy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,\nObeying in commanding, and thy parts\nSovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,\nThe queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;\nAnd, like her true nobility, she has\nCarried herself towards me.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nMost gracious sir,\nIn humblest manner I require your highness,\nThat it shall please you to declare, in hearing\nOf all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,\nThere must I be unloosed, although not there\nAt once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I\nDid broach this business to your highness; or\nLaid any scruple in your way, which might\nInduce you to the question on't? or ever\nHave to you, but with thanks to God for such\nA royal lady, spake one the least word that might\nBe to the prejudice of her present state,\nOr touch of her good person?\nKING HENRY VIII\nMy lord cardinal,\nI do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,\nI free you from't. You are not to be taught\nThat you have many enemies, that know not\nWhy they are so, but, like to village-curs,\nBark when their fellows do: by some of these\nThe queen is put in anger. You're excused:\nBut will you be more justified? You ever\nHave wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired\nIt to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,\nThe passages made toward it: on my honour,\nI speak my good lord cardinal to this point,\nAnd thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,\nI will be bold with time and your attention:\nThen mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:\nMy conscience first received a tenderness,\nScruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd\nBy the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;\nWho had been hither sent on the debating\nA marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and\nOur daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,\nEre a determinate resolution, he,\nI mean the bishop, did require a respite;\nWherein he might the king his lord advertise\nWhether our daughter were legitimate,\nRespecting this our marriage with the dowager,\nSometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook\nThe bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,\nYea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble\nThe region of my breast; which forced such way,\nThat many mazed considerings did throng\nAnd press'd in with this caution. First, methought\nI stood not in the smile of heaven; who had\nCommanded nature, that my lady's womb,\nIf it conceived a male child by me, should\nDo no more offices of life to't than\nThe grave does to the dead; for her male issue\nOr died where they were made, or shortly after\nThis world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,\nThis was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,\nWell worthy the best heir o' the world, should not\nBe gladded in't by me: then follows, that\nI weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in\nBy this my issue's fail; and that gave to me\nMany a groaning throe. Thus hulling in\nThe wild sea of my conscience, I did steer\nToward this remedy, whereupon we are\nNow present here together: that's to say,\nI meant to rectify my conscience,--which\nI then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--\nBy all the reverend fathers of the land\nAnd doctors learn'd: first I began in private\nWith you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember\nHow under my oppression I did reek,\nWhen I first moved you.\nLINCOLN\nVery well, my liege.\nKING HENRY VIII\nI have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say\nHow far you satisfied me.\nLINCOLN\nSo please your highness,\nThe question did at first so stagger me,\nBearing a state of mighty moment in't\nAnd consequence of dread, that I committed\nThe daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;\nAnd did entreat your highness to this course\nWhich you are running here.\nKING HENRY VIII\nI then moved you,\nMy Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave\nTo make this present summons: unsolicited\nI left no reverend person in this court;\nBut by particular consent proceeded\nUnder your hands and seals: therefore, go on:\nFor no dislike i' the world against the person\nOf the good queen, but the sharp thorny points\nOf my alleged reasons, drive this forward:\nProve but our marriage lawful, by my life\nAnd kingly dignity, we are contented\nTo wear our mortal state to come with her,\nKatharine our queen, before the primest creature\nThat's paragon'd o' the world.\nCARDINAL CAMPEIUS\nSo please your highness,\nThe queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness\nThat we adjourn this court till further day:\nMeanwhile must be an earnest motion\nMade to the queen, to call back her appeal\nShe intends unto his holiness.\nKING HENRY VIII\n[Aside] I may perceive\nThese cardinals trifle with me: I abhor\nThis dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.\nMy learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,\nPrithee, return: with thy approach, I know,\nMy comfort comes along. Break up the court:\nI say, set on.\nExeunt in manner as they entered",

I am old, my lords,\nAnd all the fellowship I hold now with him\nIs only my obedience.

You wrong your virtues\nWith these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,\nAs yours was put into you, ever casts\nSuch doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;\nBeware you lose it not: for us, if you please\nTo trust us in your business, we are ready\nTo use our utmost studies in your service.\nQUEEN KATHARINE\nDo what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,\nIf I have used myself unmannerly;\nYou know I am a woman, lacking wit\nTo make a seemly answer to such persons.\nPray, do my service to his majesty:\nHe has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers\nWhile I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,\nBestow your counsels on me: she now begs,\nThat little thought, when she set footing here,\nShe should have bought her dignities so dear.\nExeunt",

Ante-chamber to KING HENRY VIII's apartment.\nEnter NORFOLK, SUFFOLK, SURREY, and Chamberlain\nNORFOLK\nIf you will now unite in your complaints,\nAnd force them with a constancy, the cardinal\nCannot stand under them: if you omit\nThe offer of this time, I cannot promise\nBut that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,\nWith these you bear already.\nSURREY\nI am joyful\nTo meet the least occasion that may give me\nRemembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,\nTo be revenged on him.\nSUFFOLK\nWhich of the peers\nHave uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least\nStrangely neglected? when did he regard\nThe stamp of nobleness in any person\nOut of himself?\nChamberlain\nMy lords, you speak your pleasures:\nWhat he deserves of you and me I know;\nWhat we can do to him, though now the time\nGives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot\nBar his access to the king, never attempt\nAny thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft\nOver the king in's tongue.\nNORFOLK\nO, fear him not;\nHis spell in that is out: the king hath found\nMatter against him that for ever mars\nThe honey of his language. No, he's settled,\nNot to come off, in his displeasure.\nSURREY\nSir,\nI should be glad to hear such news as this\nOnce every hour.\nNORFOLK\nBelieve it, this is true:\nIn the divorce his contrary proceedings\nAre all unfolded wherein he appears\nAs I would wish mine enemy.\nSURREY\nHow came\nHis practises to light?\nSUFFOLK\nMost strangely.\nSURREY\nO, how, how?\nSUFFOLK\nThe cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,\nAnd came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,\nHow that the cardinal did entreat his holiness\nTo stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if\nIt did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive\nMy king is tangled in affection to\nA creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'\nSURREY\nHas the king this?\nSUFFOLK\nBelieve it.\nSURREY\nWill this work?\nChamberlain\nThe king in this perceives him, how he coasts\nAnd hedges his own way. But in this point\nAll his tricks founder, and he brings his physic\nAfter his patient's death: the king already\nHath married the fair lady.\nSURREY\nWould he had!\nSUFFOLK\nMay you be happy in your wish, my lord\nFor, I profess, you have it.\nSURREY\nNow, all my joy\nTrace the conjunction!\nSUFFOLK\nMy amen to't!\nNORFOLK\nAll men's!\nSUFFOLK\nThere's order given for her coronation:\nMarry, this is yet but young, and may be left\nTo some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,\nShe is a gallant creature, and complete\nIn mind and feature: I persuade me, from her\nWill fall some blessing to this land, which shall\nIn it be memorised.\nSURREY\nBut, will the king\nDigest this letter of the cardinal's?\nThe Lord forbid!\nNORFOLK\nMarry, amen!\nSUFFOLK\nNo, no;\nThere be moe wasps that buzz about his nose\nWill make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius\nIs stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;\nHas left the cause o' the king unhandled; and\nIs posted, as the agent of our cardinal,\nTo second all his plot. I do assure you\nThe king cried Ha! at this.\nChamberlain\nNow, God incense him,\nAnd let him cry Ha! louder!\nNORFOLK\nBut, my lord,\nWhen returns Cranmer?\nSUFFOLK\nHe is return'd in his opinions; which\nHave satisfied the king for his divorce,\nTogether with all famous colleges\nAlmost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,\nHis second marriage shall be publish'd, and\nHer coronation. Katharine no more\nShall be call'd queen, but princess dowager\nAnd widow to Prince Arthur.\nNORFOLK\nThis same Cranmer's\nA worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain\nIn the king's business.\nSUFFOLK\nHe has; and we shall see him\nFor it an archbishop.\nNORFOLK\nSo I hear.\nSUFFOLK\n'Tis so.\nThe cardinal!\nEnter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL\n\nNORFOLK\nObserve, observe, he's moody.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nThe packet, Cromwell.\nGave't you the king?\nCROMWELL\nTo his own hand, in's bedchamber.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nLook'd he o' the inside of the paper?\nCROMWELL\nPresently\nHe did unseal them: and the first he view'd,\nHe did it with a serious mind; a heed\nWas in his countenance. You he bade\nAttend him here this morning.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nIs he ready\nTo come abroad?\nCROMWELL\nI think, by this he is.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nLeave me awhile.\nExit CROMWELL\n\nAside\n\nIt shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,\nThe French king's sister: he shall marry her.\nAnne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:\nThere's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!\nNo, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish\nTo hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!\nNORFOLK\nHe's discontented.\nSUFFOLK\nMay be, he hears the king\nDoes whet his anger to him.\nSURREY\nSharp enough,\nLord, for thy justice!\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\n[Aside] The late queen's gentlewoman,\na knight's daughter,\nTo be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!\nThis candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;\nThen out it goes. What though I know her virtuous\nAnd well deserving? yet I know her for\nA spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to\nOur cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of\nOur hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up\nAn heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one\nHath crawl'd into the favour of the king,\nAnd is his oracle.\nNORFOLK\nHe is vex'd at something.\nSURREY\nI would 'twere something that would fret the string,\nThe master-cord on's heart!\nEnter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL\n\nSUFFOLK\nThe king, the king!\nKING HENRY VIII\nWhat piles of wealth hath he accumulated\nTo his own portion! and what expense by the hour\nSeems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,\nDoes he rake this together! Now, my lords,\nSaw you the cardinal?\nNORFOLK\nMy lord, we have\nStood here observing him: some strange commotion\nIs in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;\nStops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,\nThen lays his finger on his temple, straight\nSprings out into fast gait; then stops again,\nStrikes his breast hard, and anon he casts\nHis eye against the moon: in most strange postures\nWe have seen him set himself.\nKING HENRY VIII\nIt may well be;\nThere is a mutiny in's mind. This morning\nPapers of state he sent me to peruse,\nAs I required: and wot you what I found\nThere,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?\nForsooth, an inventory, thus importing;\nThe several parcels of his plate, his treasure,\nRich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which\nI find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks\nPossession of a subject.\nNORFOLK\nIt's heaven's will:\nSome spirit put this paper in the packet,\nTo bless your eye withal.\nKING HENRY VIII\nIf we did think\nHis contemplation were above the earth,\nAnd fix'd on spiritual object, he should still\nDwell in his musings: but I am afraid\nHis thinkings are below the moon, not worth\nHis serious considering.\nKing HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL, who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY\n\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nHeaven forgive me!\nEver God bless your highness!\nKING HENRY VIII\nGood my lord,\nYou are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory\nOf your best graces in your mind; the which\nYou were now running o'er: you have scarce time\nTo steal from spiritual leisure a brief span\nTo keep your earthly audit: sure, in that\nI deem you an ill husband, and am glad\nTo have you therein my companion.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nSir,\nFor holy offices I have a time; a time\nTo think upon the part of business which\nI bear i' the state; and nature does require\nHer times of preservation, which perforce\nI, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,\nMust give my tendence to.\nKING HENRY VIII\nYou have said well.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nAnd ever may your highness yoke together,\nAs I will lend you cause, my doing well\nWith my well saying!\nKING HENRY VIII\n'Tis well said again;\nAnd 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:\nAnd yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:\nHis said he did; and with his deed did crown\nHis word upon you. Since I had my office,\nI have kept you next my heart; have not alone\nEmploy'd you where high profits might come home,\nBut pared my present havings, to bestow\nMy bounties upon you.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\n[Aside] What should this mean?\nSURREY\n[Aside] The Lord increase this business!\nKING HENRY VIII\nHave I not made you,\nThe prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,\nIf what I now pronounce you have found true:\nAnd, if you may confess it, say withal,\nIf you are bound to us or no. What say you?\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nMy sovereign, I confess your royal graces,\nShower'd on me daily, have been more than could\nMy studied purposes requite; which went\nBeyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours\nHave ever come too short of my desires,\nYet filed with my abilities: mine own ends\nHave been mine so that evermore they pointed\nTo the good of your most sacred person and\nThe profit of the state. For your great graces\nHeap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I\nCan nothing render but allegiant thanks,\nMy prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,\nWhich ever has and ever shall be growing,\nTill death, that winter, kill it.\nKING HENRY VIII\nFairly answer'd;\nA loyal and obedient subject is\nTherein illustrated: the honour of it\nDoes pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,\nThe foulness is the punishment. I presume\nThat, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,\nMy heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more\nOn you than any; so your hand and heart,\nYour brain, and every function of your power,\nShould, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,\nAs 'twere in love's particular, be more\nTo me, your friend, than any.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nI do profess\nThat for your highness' good I ever labour'd\nMore than mine own; that am, have, and will be--\nThough all the world should crack their duty to you,\nAnd throw it from their soul; though perils did\nAbound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and\nAppear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,\nAs doth a rock against the chiding flood,\nShould the approach of this wild river break,\nAnd stand unshaken yours.\nKING HENRY VIII\n'Tis nobly spoken:\nTake notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,\nFor you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;\nGiving him papers\n\nAnd after, this: and then to breakfast with\nWhat appetite you have.\nExit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY: the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering\n\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nWhat should this mean?\nWhat sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?\nHe parted frowning from me, as if ruin\nLeap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion\nUpon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;\nThen makes him nothing. I must read this paper;\nI fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;\nThis paper has undone me: 'tis the account\nOf all that world of wealth I have drawn together\nFor mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,\nAnd fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!\nFit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil\nMade me put this main secret in the packet\nI sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?\nNo new device to beat this from his brains?\nI know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know\nA way, if it take right, in spite of fortune\nWill bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'\nThe letter, as I live, with all the business\nI writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!\nI have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;\nAnd, from that full meridian of my glory,\nI haste now to my setting: I shall fall\nLike a bright exhalation m the evening,\nAnd no man see me more.\nRe-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY, and the Chamberlain\n\nNORFOLK\nHear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you\nTo render up the great seal presently\nInto our hands; and to confine yourself\nTo Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,\nTill you hear further from his highness.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nStay:\nWhere's your commission, lords? words cannot carry\nAuthority so weighty.\nSUFFOLK\nWho dare cross 'em,\nBearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nTill I find more than will or words to do it,\nI mean your malice, know, officious lords,\nI dare and must deny it. Now I feel\nOf what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:\nHow eagerly ye follow my disgraces,\nAs if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton\nYe appear in every thing may bring my ruin!\nFollow your envious courses, men of malice;\nYou have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,\nIn time will find their fit rewards. That seal,\nYou ask with such a violence, the king,\nMine and your master, with his own hand gave me;\nBade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,\nDuring my life; and, to confirm his goodness,\nTied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?\nSURREY\nThe king, that gave it.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nIt must be himself, then.\nSURREY\nThou art a proud traitor, priest.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nProud lord, thou liest:\nWithin these forty hours Surrey durst better\nHave burnt that tongue than said so.\nSURREY\nThy ambition,\nThou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land\nOf noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:\nThe heads of all thy brother cardinals,\nWith thee and all thy best parts bound together,\nWeigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!\nYou sent me deputy for Ireland;\nFar from his succor, from the king, from all\nThat might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;\nWhilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,\nAbsolved him with an axe.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nThis, and all else\nThis talking lord can lay upon my credit,\nI answer is most false. The duke by law\nFound his deserts: how innocent I was\nFrom any private malice in his end,\nHis noble jury and foul cause can witness.\nIf I loved many words, lord, I should tell you\nYou have as little honesty as honour,\nThat in the way of loyalty and truth\nToward the king, my ever royal master,\nDare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,\nAnd all that love his follies.\nSURREY\nBy my soul,\nYour long coat, priest, protects you; thou\nshouldst feel\nMy sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,\nCan ye endure to hear this arrogance?\nAnd from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,\nTo be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,\nFarewell nobility; let his grace go forward,\nAnd dare us with his cap like larks.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nAll goodness\nIs poison to thy stomach.\nSURREY\nYes, that goodness\nOf gleaning all the land's wealth into one,\nInto your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;\nThe goodness of your intercepted packets\nYou writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,\nSince you provoke me, shall be most notorious.\nMy Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,\nAs you respect the common good, the state\nOf our despised nobility, our issues,\nWho, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,\nProduce the grand sum of his sins, the articles\nCollected from his life. I'll startle you\nWorse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench\nLay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nHow much, methinks, I could despise this man,\nBut that I am bound in charity against it!\nNORFOLK\nThose articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:\nBut, thus much, they are foul ones.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nSo much fairer\nAnd spotless shall mine innocence arise,\nWhen the king knows my truth.\nSURREY\nThis cannot save you:\nI thank my memory, I yet remember\nSome of these articles; and out they shall.\nNow, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,\nYou'll show a little honesty.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nSpeak on, sir;\nI dare your worst objections: if I blush,\nIt is to see a nobleman want manners.\nSURREY\nI had rather want those than my head. Have at you!\nFirst, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,\nYou wrought to be a legate; by which power\nYou maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.\nNORFOLK\nThen, that in all you writ to Rome, or else\nTo foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'\nWas still inscribed; in which you brought the king\nTo be your servant.\nSUFFOLK\nThen that, without the knowledge\nEither of king or council, when you went\nAmbassador to the emperor, you made bold\nTo carry into Flanders the great seal.\nSURREY\nItem, you sent a large commission\nTo Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,\nWithout the king's will or the state's allowance,\nA league between his highness and Ferrara.\nSUFFOLK\nThat, out of mere ambition, you have caused\nYour holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.\nSURREY\nThen that you have sent innumerable substance--\nBy what means got, I leave to your own conscience--\nTo furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways\nYou have for dignities; to the mere undoing\nOf all the kingdom. Many more there are;\nWhich, since they are of you, and odious,\nI will not taint my mouth with.\nChamberlain\nO my lord,\nPress not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:\nHis faults lie open to the laws; let them,\nNot you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him\nSo little of his great self.\nSURREY\nI forgive him.\nSUFFOLK\nLord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,\nBecause all those things you have done of late,\nBy your power legatine, within this kingdom,\nFall into the compass of a praemunire,\nThat therefore such a writ be sued against you;\nTo forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,\nChattels, and whatsoever, and to be\nOut of the king's protection. This is my charge.\nNORFOLK\nAnd so we'll leave you to your meditations\nHow to live better. For your stubborn answer\nAbout the giving back the great seal to us,\nThe king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.\nSo fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.\nExeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY\n\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nSo farewell to the little good you bear me.\nFarewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!\nThis is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\nThe tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,\nAnd bears his blushing honours thick upon him;\nThe third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\nAnd, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\nHis greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\nAnd then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,\nLike little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\nThis many summers in a sea of glory,\nBut far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\nAt length broke under me and now has left me,\nWeary and old with service, to the mercy\nOf a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.\nVain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\nI feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched\nIs that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!\nThere is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\nThat sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\nMore pangs and fears than wars or women have:\nAnd when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,\nNever to hope again.\nEnter CROMWELL, and stands amazed\n\nWhy, how now, Cromwell!\nCROMWELL\nI have no power to speak, sir.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nWhat, amazed\nAt my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder\nA great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,\nI am fall'n indeed.\nCROMWELL\nHow does your grace?\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nWhy, well;\nNever so truly happy, my good Cromwell.\nI know myself now; and I feel within me\nA peace above all earthly dignities,\nA still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,\nI humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,\nThese ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken\nA load would sink a navy, too much honour:\nO, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen\nToo heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!\nCROMWELL\nI am glad your grace has made that right use of it.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nI hope I have: I am able now, methinks,\nOut of a fortitude of soul I feel,\nTo endure more miseries and greater far\nThan my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.\nWhat news abroad?\nCROMWELL\nThe heaviest and the worst\nIs your displeasure with the king.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nGod bless him!\nCROMWELL\nThe next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen\nLord chancellor in your place.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nThat's somewhat sudden:\nBut he's a learned man. May he continue\nLong in his highness' favour, and do justice\nFor truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,\nWhen he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,\nMay have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?\nCROMWELL\nThat Cranmer is return'd with welcome,\nInstall'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nThat's news indeed.\nCROMWELL\nLast, that the Lady Anne,\nWhom the king hath in secrecy long married,\nThis day was view'd in open as his queen,\nGoing to chapel; and the voice is now\nOnly about her coronation.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nThere was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,\nThe king has gone beyond me: all my glories\nIn that one woman I have lost for ever:\nNo sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,\nOr gild again the noble troops that waited\nUpon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;\nI am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now\nTo be thy lord and master: seek the king;\nThat sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him\nWhat and how true thou art: he will advance thee;\nSome little memory of me will stir him--\nI know his noble nature--not to let\nThy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,\nNeglect him not; make use now, and provide\nFor thine own future safety.\nCROMWELL\nO my lord,\nMust I, then, leave you? must I needs forego\nSo good, so noble and so true a master?\nBear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,\nWith what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.\nThe king shall have my service: but my prayers\nFor ever and for ever shall be yours.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nCromwell, I did not think to shed a tear\nIn all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,\nOut of thy honest truth, to play the woman.\nLet's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;\nAnd, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,\nAnd sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention\nOf me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,\nSay, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,\nAnd sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,\nFound thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;\nA sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.\nMark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.\nCromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:\nBy that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,\nThe image of his Maker, hope to win by it?\nLove thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;\nCorruption wins not more than honesty.\nStill in thy right hand carry gentle peace,\nTo silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:\nLet all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,\nThy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,\nO Cromwell,\nThou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;\nAnd,--prithee, lead me in:\nThere take an inventory of all I have,\nTo the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,\nAnd my integrity to heaven, is all\nI dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!\nHad I but served my God with half the zeal\nI served my king, he would not in mine age\nHave left me naked to mine enemies.\nCROMWELL\nGood sir, have patience.\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\nSo I have. Farewell\nThe hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.\nExeunt",

    "content":"ACT IV\nSCENE I. A street in Westminster.\nEnter two Gentlemen, meeting one another\nFirst Gentleman\nYou're well met once again.\nSecond Gentleman\nSo are you.\nFirst Gentleman\nYou come to take your stand here, and behold\nThe Lady Anne pass from her coronation?\nSecond Gentleman\n'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,\nThe Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.\nFirst Gentleman\n'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;\nThis, general joy.\nSecond Gentleman\n'Tis well: the citizens,\nI am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--\nAs, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--\nIn celebration of this day with shows,\nPageants and sights of honour.\nFirst Gentleman\nNever greater,\nNor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.\nSecond Gentleman\nMay I be bold to ask at what that contains,\nThat paper in your hand?\nFirst Gentleman\nYes; 'tis the list\nOf those that claim their offices this day\nBy custom of the coronation.\nThe Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims\nTo be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,\nHe to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.\nSecond Gentleman\nI thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,\nI should have been beholding to your paper.\nBut, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,\nThe princess dowager? how goes her business?\nFirst Gentleman\nThat I can tell you too. The Archbishop\nOf Canterbury, accompanied with other\nLearned and reverend fathers of his order,\nHeld a late court at Dunstable, six miles off\nFrom Ampthill where the princess lay; to which\nShe was often cited by them, but appear'd not:\nAnd, to be short, for not appearance and\nThe king's late scruple, by the main assent\nOf all these learned men she was divorced,\nAnd the late marriage made of none effect\nSince which she was removed to Kimbolton,\nWhere she remains now sick.\nSecond Gentleman\nAlas, good lady!\nTrumpets\n\nThe trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.\nHautboys\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE CORONATION\n\n1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.\n2. Then, two Judges.\n3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace\nbefore him.\n4. Choristers, singing.\nMusic\n\n5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then\nGarter, in his coat of arms, and on his\nhead a gilt copper crown.\n6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,\non his head a demi-coronal of gold. With\nhim, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver with\nthe dove, crowned with an earl's coronet.\nCollars of SS.\n7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet\non his head, bearing a long white wand, as\nhigh-steward. With him, NORFOLK, with the\nrod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.\nCollars of SS.\n8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;\nunder it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hair\nrichly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each\nside her, the Bishops of London and\nWinchester.\n9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of\ngold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEEN\nANNE's train.\n10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain\ncirclets of gold without flowers.\nThey pass over the stage in order and state\n\nSecond Gentleman\nA royal train, believe me. These I know:\nWho's that that bears the sceptre?\nFirst Gentleman\nMarquess Dorset:\nAnd that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.\nSecond Gentleman\nA bold brave gentleman. That should be\nThe Duke of Suffolk?\nFirst Gentleman\n'Tis the same: high-steward.\nSecond Gentleman\nAnd that my Lord of Norfolk?\nFirst Gentleman\nYes;\nSecond Gentleman\nHeaven bless thee!\nLooking on QUEEN ANNE\n\nThou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.\nSir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;\nOur king has all the Indies in his arms,\nAnd more and richer, when he strains that lady:\nI cannot blame his conscience.\nFirst Gentleman\nThey that bear\nThe cloth of honour over her, are four barons\nOf the Cinque-ports.\nSecond Gentleman\nThose men are happy; and so are all are near her.\nI take it, she that carries up the train\nIs that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.\nFirst Gentleman\nIt is; and all the rest are countesses.\nSecond Gentleman\nTheir coronets say so. These are stars indeed;\nAnd sometimes falling ones.\nFirst Gentleman\nNo more of that.\nExit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets\n\nEnter a third Gentleman\n\nFirst Gentleman\nGod save you, sir! where have you been broiling?\nThird Gentleman\nAmong the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger\nCould not be wedged in more: I am stifled\nWith the mere rankness of their joy.\nSecond Gentleman\nYou saw\nThe ceremony?\nThird Gentleman\nThat I did.\nFirst Gentleman\nHow was it?\nThird Gentleman\nWell worth the seeing.\nSecond Gentleman\nGood sir, speak it to us.\nThird Gentleman\nAs well as I am able. The rich stream\nOf lords and ladies, having brought the queen\nTo a prepared place in the choir, fell off\nA distance from her; while her grace sat down\nTo rest awhile, some half an hour or so,\nIn a rich chair of state, opposing freely\nThe beauty of her person to the people.\nBelieve me, sir, she is the goodliest woman\nThat ever lay by man: which when the people\nHad the full view of, such a noise arose\nAs the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,\nAs loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--\nDoublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces\nBeen loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy\nI never saw before. Great-bellied women,\nThat had not half a week to go, like rams\nIn the old time of war, would shake the press,\nAnd make 'em reel before 'em. No man living\nCould say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven\nSo strangely in one piece.\nSecond Gentleman\nBut, what follow'd?\nThird Gentleman\nAt length her grace rose, and with modest paces\nCame to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like\nCast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.\nThen rose again and bow'd her to the people:\nWhen by the Archbishop of Canterbury\nShe had all the royal makings of a queen;\nAs holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,\nThe rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems\nLaid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,\nWith all the choicest music of the kingdom,\nTogether sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,\nAnd with the same full state paced back again\nTo York-place, where the feast is held.\nFirst Gentleman\nSir,\nYou must no more call it York-place, that's past;\nFor, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:\n'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.\nThird Gentleman\nI know it;\nBut 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name\nIs fresh about me.\nSecond Gentleman\nWhat two reverend bishops\nWere those that went on each side of the queen?\nThird Gentleman\nStokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,\nNewly preferr'd from the king's secretary,\nThe other, London.\nSecond Gentleman\nHe of Winchester\nIs held no great good lover of the archbishop's,\nThe virtuous Cranmer.\nThird Gentleman\nAll the land knows that:\nHowever, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,\nCranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.\nSecond Gentleman\nWho may that be, I pray you?\nThird Gentleman\nThomas Cromwell;\nA man in much esteem with the king, and truly\nA worthy friend. The king has made him master\nO' the jewel house,\nAnd one, already, of the privy council.\nSecond Gentleman\nHe will deserve more.\nThird Gentleman\nYes, without all doubt.\nCome, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which\nIs to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:\nSomething I can command. As I walk thither,\nI'll tell ye more.\nBoth\nYou may command us, sir.\nExeunt",

Kimbolton.\nEnter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman\nGRIFFITH\nHow does your grace?\nKATHARINE\nO Griffith, sick to death!\nMy legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,\nWilling to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:\nSo; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.\nDidst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,\nThat the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?\nGRIFFITH\nYes, madam; but I think your grace,\nOut of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.\nKATHARINE\nPrithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:\nIf well, he stepp'd before me, happily\nFor my example.\nGRIFFITH\nWell, the voice goes, madam:\nFor after the stout Earl Northumberland\nArrested him at York, and brought him forward,\nAs a man sorely tainted, to his answer,\nHe fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill\nHe could not sit his mule.\nKATHARINE\nAlas, poor man!\nGRIFFITH\nAt last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,\nLodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,\nWith all his covent, honourably received him;\nTo whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,\nAn old man, broken with the storms of state,\nIs come to lay his weary bones among ye;\nGive him a little earth for charity!'\nSo went to bed; where eagerly his sickness\nPursued him still: and, three nights after this,\nAbout the hour of eight, which he himself\nForetold should be his last, full of repentance,\nContinual meditations, tears, and sorrows,\nHe gave his honours to the world again,\nHis blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.\nKATHARINE\nSo may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!\nYet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,\nAnd yet with charity. He was a man\nOf an unbounded stomach, ever ranking\nHimself with princes; one that, by suggestion,\nTied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;\nHis own opinion was his law: i' the presence\nHe would say untruths; and be ever double\nBoth in his words and meaning: he was never,\nBut where he meant to ruin, pitiful:\nHis promises were, as he then was, mighty;\nBut his performance, as he is now, nothing:\nOf his own body he was ill, and gave\nThe clergy in example.\nGRIFFITH\nNoble madam,\nMen's evil manners live in brass; their virtues\nWe write in water. May it please your highness\nTo hear me speak his good now?\nKATHARINE\nYes, good Griffith;\nI were malicious else.\nGRIFFITH\nThis cardinal,\nThough from an humble stock, undoubtedly\nWas fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.\nHe was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;\nExceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:\nLofty and sour to them that loved him not;\nBut to those men that sought him sweet as summer.\nAnd though he were unsatisfied in getting,\nWhich was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,\nHe was most princely: ever witness for him\nThose twins Of learning that he raised in you,\nIpswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,\nUnwilling to outlive the good that did it;\nThe other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,\nSo excellent in art, and still so rising,\nThat Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.\nHis overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;\nFor then, and not till then, he felt himself,\nAnd found the blessedness of being little:\nAnd, to add greater honours to his age\nThan man could give him, he died fearing God.\nKATHARINE\nAfter my death I wish no other herald,\nNo other speaker of my living actions,\nTo keep mine honour from corruption,\nBut such an honest chronicler as Griffith.\nWhom I most hated living, thou hast made me,\nWith thy religious truth and modesty,\nNow in his ashes honour: peace be with him!\nPatience, be near me still; and set me lower:\nI have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,\nCause the musicians play me that sad note\nI named my knell, whilst I sit meditating\nOn that celestial harmony I go to.\nSad and solemn music\n\nGRIFFITH\nShe is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,\nFor fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.\nThe vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six personages, clad in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in their hands. They first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her head; at which the other four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes, and holding the garland over her head: which done, they deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order: at which, as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues\n\nKATHARINE\nSpirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,\nAnd leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?\nGRIFFITH\nMadam, we are here.\nKATHARINE\nIt is not you I call for:\nSaw ye none enter since I slept?\nGRIFFITH\nNone, madam.\nKATHARINE\nNo? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop\nInvite me to a banquet; whose bright faces\nCast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?\nThey promised me eternal happiness;\nAnd brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel\nI am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.\nGRIFFITH\nI am most joyful, madam, such good dreams\nPossess your fancy.\nKATHARINE\nBid the music leave,\nThey are harsh and heavy to me.\nMusic ceases\n\nPATIENCE\nDo you note\nHow much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?\nHow long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,\nAnd of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!\nGRIFFITH\nShe is going, wench: pray, pray.\nPATIENCE\nHeaven comfort her!\nEnter a Messenger\n\nMessenger\nAn't like your grace,--\nKATHARINE\nYou are a saucy fellow:\nDeserve we no more reverence?\nGRIFFITH\nYou are to blame,\nKnowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,\nTo use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.\nMessenger\nI humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;\nMy haste made me unmannerly. There is staying\nA gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.\nKATHARINE\nAdmit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow\nLet me ne'er see again.\nExeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger\n\nRe-enter GRIFFITH, with CAPUCIUS\n\nIf my sight fail not,\nYou should be lord ambassador from the emperor,\nMy royal nephew, and your name Capucius.\nCAPUCIUS\nMadam, the same; your servant.\nKATHARINE\nO, my lord,\nThe times and titles now are alter'd strangely\nWith me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,\nWhat is your pleasure with me?\nCAPUCIUS\nNoble lady,\nFirst mine own service to your grace; the next,\nThe king's request that I would visit you;\nWho grieves much for your weakness, and by me\nSends you his princely commendations,\nAnd heartily entreats you take good comfort.\nKATHARINE\nO my good lord, that comfort comes too late;\n'Tis like a pardon after execution:\nThat gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;\nBut now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.\nHow does his highness?\nCAPUCIUS\nMadam, in good health.\nKATHARINE\nSo may he ever do! and ever flourish,\nWhen I shal l dwell with worms, and my poor name\nBanish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,\nI caused you write, yet sent away?\nPATIENCE\nNo, madam.\nGiving it to KATHARINE\n\nKATHARINE\nSir, I most humbly pray you to deliver\nThis to my lord the king.\nCAPUCIUS\nMost willing, madam.\nKATHARINE\nIn which I have commended to his goodness\nThe model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;\nThe dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!\nBeseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--\nShe is young, and of a noble modest nature,\nI hope she will deserve well,--and a little\nTo love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,\nHeaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition\nIs, that his noble grace would have some pity\nUpon my wretched women, that so long\nHave follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:\nOf which there is not one, I dare avow,\nAnd now I should not lie, but will deserve\nFor virtue and true beauty of the soul,\nFor honesty and decent carriage,\nA right good husband, let him be a noble\nAnd, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.\nThe last is, for my men; they are the poorest,\nBut poverty could never draw 'em from me;\nThat they may have their wages duly paid 'em,\nAnd something over to remember me by:\nIf heaven had pleased to have given me longer life\nAnd able means, we had not parted thus.\nThese are the whole contents: and, good my lord,\nBy that you love the dearest in this world,\nAs you wish Christian peace to souls departed,\nStand these poor people's friend, and urge the king\nTo do me this last right.\nCAPUCIUS\nBy heaven, I will,\nOr let me lose the fashion of a man!\nKATHARINE\nI thank you, honest lord. Remember me\nIn all humility unto his highness:\nSay his long trouble now is passing\nOut of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,\nFor so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,\nMy lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,\nYou must not leave me yet: I must to bed;\nCall in more women. When I am dead, good wench,\nLet me be used with honour: strew me over\nWith maiden flowers, that all the world may know\nI was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,\nThen lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like\nA queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.\nI can no more.\nExeunt, leading KATHARINE",

I fear nothing\nWhat can be said against me.\nKING HENRY VIII\nKnow you not\nHow your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?\nYour enemies are many, and not small; their practises\nMust bear the same proportion; and not ever\nThe justice and the truth o' the question carries\nThe due o' the verdict with it: at what ease\nMight corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt\nTo swear against you? such things have been done.\nYou are potently opposed; and with a malice\nOf as great size. Ween you of better luck,\nI mean, in perjured witness, than your master,\nWhose minister you are, whiles here he lived\nUpon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;\nYou take a precipice for no leap of danger,\nAnd woo your own destruction.\nCRANMER\nGod and your majesty\nProtect mine innocence, or I fall into\nThe trap is laid for me!\nKING HENRY VIII\nBe of good cheer;\nThey shall no more prevail than we give way to.\nKeep comfort to you; and this morning see\nYou do appear before them: if they shall chance,\nIn charging you with matters, to commit you,\nThe best persuasions to the contrary\nFail not to use, and with what vehemency\nThe occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties\nWill render you no remedy, this ring\nDeliver them, and your appeal to us\nThere make before them. Look, the good man weeps!\nHe's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother!\nI swear he is true--hearted; and a soul\nNone better in my kingdom. Get you gone,\nAnd do as I have bid you.\nExit CRANMER\n\nHe has strangled\nHis language in his tears.\nEnter Old Lady, LOVELL following\n\nGentleman\n[Within] Come back: what mean you?\nOld Lady\nI'll not come back; the tidings that I bring\nWill make my boldness manners. Now, good angels\nFly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person\nUnder their blessed wings!\nKING HENRY VIII\nNow, by thy looks\nI guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?\nSay, ay; and of a boy.\nOld Lady\nAy, ay, my liege;\nAnd of a lovely boy: the God of heaven\nBoth now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,\nPromises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen\nDesires your visitation, and to be\nAcquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you\nAs cherry is to cherry.\nKING HENRY VIII\nLovell!\nLOVELL\nSir?\nKING HENRY VIII\nGive her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.\nExit\n\nOld Lady\nAn hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more.\nAn ordinary groom is for such payment.\nI will have more, or scold it out of him.\nSaid I for this, the girl was like to him?\nI will have more, or else unsay't; and now,\nWhile it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.\nExeunt",

Keeper at the door\nChancellor\nSpeak to the business, master-secretary:\nWhy are we met in council?\nCROMWELL\nPlease your honours,\nThe chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.\nGARDINER\nHas he had knowledge of it?\nCROMWELL\nYes.\nNORFOLK\nWho waits there?\nKeeper\nWithout, my noble lords?\nGARDINER\nYes.\nKeeper\nMy lord archbishop;\nAnd has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.\nChancellor\nLet him come in.\nKeeper\nYour grace may enter now.\nCRANMER enters and approaches the council-table\n\nChancellor\nMy good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry\nTo sit here at this present, and behold\nThat chair stand empty: but we all are men,\nIn our own natures frail, and capable\nOf our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty\nAnd want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,\nHave misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,\nToward the king first, then his laws, in filling\nThe whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,\nFor so we are inform'd, with new opinions,\nDivers and dangerous; which are heresies,\nAnd, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.\nGARDINER\nWhich reformation must be sudden too,\nMy noble lords; for those that tame wild horses\nPace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,\nBut stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,\nTill they obey the manage. If we suffer,\nOut of our easiness and childish pity\nTo one man's honour, this contagious sickness,\nFarewell all physic: and what follows then?\nCommotions, uproars, with a general taint\nOf the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,\nThe upper Germany, can dearly witness,\nYet freshly pitied in our memories.\nCRANMER\nMy good lords, hitherto, in all the progress\nBoth of my life and office, I have labour'd,\nAnd with no little study, that my teaching\nAnd the strong course of my authority\nMight go one way, and safely; and the end\nWas ever, to do well: nor is there living,\nI speak it with a single heart, my lords,\nA man that more detests, more stirs against,\nBoth in his private conscience and his place,\nDefacers of a public peace, than I do.\nPray heaven, the king may never find a heart\nWith less allegiance in it! Men that make\nEnvy and crooked malice nourishment\nDare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,\nThat, in this case of justice, my accusers,\nBe what they will, may stand forth face to face,\nAnd freely urge against me.\nSUFFOLK\nNay, my lord,\nThat cannot be: you are a counsellor,\nAnd, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.\nGARDINER\nMy lord, because we have business of more moment,\nWe will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,\nAnd our consent, for better trial of you,\nFrom hence you be committed to the Tower;\nWhere, being but a private man again,\nYou shall know many dare accuse you boldly,\nMore than, I fear, you are provided for.\nCRANMER\nAh, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;\nYou are always my good friend; if your will pass,\nI shall both find your lordship judge and juror,\nYou are so merciful: I see your end;\n'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,\nBecome a churchman better than ambition:\nWin straying souls with modesty again,\nCast none away. That I shall clear myself,\nLay all the weight ye can upon my patience,\nI make as little doubt, as you do conscience\nIn doing daily wrongs. I could say more,\nBut reverence to your calling makes me modest.\nGARDINER\nMy lord, my lord, you are a sectary,\nThat's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,\nTo men that understand you, words and weakness.\nCROMWELL\nMy Lord of Winchester, you are a little,\nBy your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,\nHowever faulty, yet should find respect\nFor what they have been: 'tis a cruelty\nTo load a falling man.\nGARDINER\nGood master secretary,\nI cry your honour mercy; you may, worst\nOf all this table, say so.\nCROMWELL\nWhy, my lord?\nGARDINER\nDo not I know you for a favourer\nOf this new sect? ye are not sound.\nCROMWELL\nNot sound?\nGARDINER\nNot sound, I say.\nCROMWELL\nWould you were half so honest!\nMen's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.\nGARDINER\nI shall remember this bold language.\nCROMWELL\nDo.\nRemember your bold life too.\nChancellor\nThis is too much;\nForbear, for shame, my lords.\nGARDINER\nI have done.\nCROMWELL\nAnd I.\nChancellor\nThen thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,\nI take it, by all voices, that forthwith\nYou be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;\nThere to remain till the king's further pleasure\nBe known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?\nAll\nWe are.\nCRANMER\nIs there no other way of mercy,\nBut I must needs to the Tower, my lords?\nGARDINER\nWhat other\nWould you expect? you are strangely troublesome.\nLet some o' the guard be ready there.\nEnter Guard\n\nCRANMER\nFor me?\nMust I go like a traitor thither?\nGARDINER\nReceive him,\nAnd see him safe i' the Tower.\nCRANMER\nStay, good my lords,\nI have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;\nBy virtue of that ring, I take my cause\nOut of the gripes of cruel men, and give it\nTo a most noble judge, the king my master.\nChamberlain\nThis is the king's ring.\nSURREY\n'Tis no counterfeit.\nSUFFOLK\n'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,\nWhen ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,\n'Twould fall upon ourselves.\nNORFOLK\nDo you think, my lords,\nThe king will suffer but the little finger\nOf this man to be vex'd?\nChancellor\n'Tis now too certain:\nHow much more is his life in value with him?\nWould I were fairly out on't!\nCROMWELL\nMy mind gave me,\nIn seeking tales and informations\nAgainst this man, whose honesty the devil\nAnd his disciples only envy at,\nYe blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!\nEnter KING, frowning on them; takes his seat\n\nGARDINER\nDread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven\nIn daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;\nNot only good and wise, but most religious:\nOne that, in all obedience, makes the church\nThe chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen\nThat holy duty, out of dear respect,\nHis royal self in judgment comes to hear\nThe cause betwixt her and this great offender.\nKING HENRY VIII\nYou were ever good at sudden commendations,\nBishop of Winchester. But know, I come not\nTo hear such flattery now, and in my presence;\nThey are too thin and bare to hide offences.\nTo me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,\nAnd think with wagging of your tongue to win me;\nBut, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure\nThou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.\nTo CRANMER\n\nGood man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest\nHe, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:\nBy all that's holy, he had better starve\nThan but once think this place becomes thee not.\nSURREY\nMay it please your grace,--\nKING HENRY VIII\nNo, sir, it does not please me.\nI had thought I had had men of some understanding\nAnd wisdom of my council; but I find none.\nWas it discretion, lords, to let this man,\nThis good man,--few of you deserve that title,--\nThis honest man, wait like a lousy footboy\nAt chamber--door? and one as great as you are?\nWhy, what a shame was this! Did my commission\nBid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye\nPower as he was a counsellor to try him,\nNot as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,\nMore out of malice than integrity,\nWould try him to the utmost, had ye mean;\nWhich ye shall never have while I live.\nChancellor\nThus far,\nMy most dread sovereign, may it like your grace\nTo let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed\nConcerning his imprisonment, was rather,\nIf there be faith in men, meant for his trial,\nAnd fair purgation to the world, than malice,\nI'm sure, in me.\nKING HENRY VIII\nWell, well, my lords, respect him;\nTake him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.\nI will say thus much for him, if a prince\nMay be beholding to a subject, I\nAm, for his love and service, so to him.\nMake me no more ado, but all embrace him:\nBe friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of\nCanterbury,\nI have a suit which you must not deny me;\nThat is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,\nYou must be godfather, and answer for her.\nCRANMER\nThe greatest monarch now alive may glory\nIn such an honour: how may I deserve it\nThat am a poor and humble subject to you?\nKING HENRY VIII\nCome, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons: you\nshall have two noble partners with you; the old\nDuchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will\nthese please you?\nOnce more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,\nEmbrace and love this man.\nGARDINER\nWith a true heart\nAnd brother-love I do it.\nCRANMER\nAnd let heaven\nWitness, how dear I hold this confirmation.\nKING HENRY VIII\nGood man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:\nThe common voice, I see, is verified\nOf thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury\nA shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'\nCome, lords, we trifle time away; I long\nTo have this young one made a Christian.\nAs I have made ye one, lords, one remain;\nSo I grow stronger, you more honour gain.\nExeunt",

Enter Porter and his Man\nPorter\nYou'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you\ntake the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,\nleave your gaping.\nWithin\n\nGood master porter, I belong to the larder.\nPorter\nBelong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is\nthis a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree\nstaves, and strong ones: these are but switches to\n'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing\nchristenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,\nyou rude rascals?\nMan\nPray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--\nUnless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--\nTo scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep\nOn May-day morning; which will never be:\nWe may as well push against Powle's, as stir em.\nPorter\nHow got they in, and be hang'd?\nMan\nAlas, I know not; how gets the tide in?\nAs much as one sound cudgel of four foot--\nYou see the poor remainder--could distribute,\nI made no spare, sir.\nPorter\nYou did nothing, sir.\nMan\nI am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,\nTo mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any\nThat had a head to hit, either young or old,\nHe or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,\nLet me ne'er hope to see a chine again\nAnd that I would not for a cow, God save her!\nWithin\n\nDo you hear, master porter?\nPorter\nI shall be with you presently, good master puppy.\nKeep the door close, sirrah.\nMan\nWhat would you have me do?\nPorter\nWhat should you do, but knock 'em down by the\ndozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have\nwe some strange Indian with the great tool come to\ncourt, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a\nfry of fornication is at door! On my Christian\nconscience, this one christening will beget a\nthousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.\nMan\nThe spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a\nfellow somewhat near the door, he should be a\nbrazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty\nof the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand\nabout him are under the line, they need no other\npenance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on\nthe head, and three times was his nose discharged\nagainst me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to\nblow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small\nwit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked\nporringer fell off her head, for kindling such a\ncombustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,\nand hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I\nmight see from far some forty truncheoners draw to\nher succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, where\nshe was quartered. They fell on; I made good my\nplace: at length they came to the broom-staff to\nme; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of\nboys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower\nof pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,\nand let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst\n'em, I think, surely.\nPorter\nThese are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,\nand fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but\nthe tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of\nLimehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.\nI have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they\nare like to dance these three days; besides the\nrunning banquet of two beadles that is to come.\nEnter Chamberlain\n\nChamberlain\nMercy o' me, what a multitude are here!\nThey grow still too; from all parts they are coming,\nAs if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,\nThese lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:\nThere's a trim rabble let in: are all these\nYour faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have\nGreat store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,\nWhen they pass back from the christening.\nPorter\nAn't please\nyour honour,\nWe are but men; and what so many may do,\nNot being torn a-pieces, we have done:\nAn army cannot rule 'em.\nChamberlain\nAs I live,\nIf the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all\nBy the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads\nClap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;\nAnd here ye lie baiting of bombards, when\nYe should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;\nThey're come already from the christening:\nGo, break among the press, and find a way out\nTo let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find\nA Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.\nPorter\nMake way there for the princess.\nMan\nYou great fellow,\nStand close up, or I'll make your head ache.\nPorter\nYou i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;\nI'll peck you o'er the pales else.\nExeunt",
