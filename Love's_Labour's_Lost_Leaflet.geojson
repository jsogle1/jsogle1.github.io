    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park\nEnter Ferdinand, King of Navarre, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine.\n\nKING.\nLet fame, that all hunt after in their lives,\nLive registered upon our brazen tombs,\nAnd then grace us in the disgrace of death;\nWhen, spite of cormorant devouring time,\nTh’ endeavour of this present breath may buy\nThat honour which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge,\nAnd make us heirs of all eternity.\nTherefore, brave conquerors, for so you are\nThat war against your own affections\nAnd the huge army of the world’s desires,\nOur late edict shall strongly stand in force.\nNavarre shall be the wonder of the world;\nOur court shall be a little academe,\nStill and contemplative in living art.\nYou three, Berowne, Dumaine and Longaville,\nHave sworn for three years’ term to live with me,\nMy fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes\nThat are recorded in this schedule here.\nYour oaths are passed, and now subscribe your names,\nThat his own hand may strike his honour down\nThat violates the smallest branch herein.\nIf you are armed to do as sworn to do,\nSubscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nI am resolved. ’Tis but a three years’ fast.\nThe mind shall banquet, though the body pine.\nFat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits\nMake rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.\n\n[He signs.]\n\nDUMAINE.\nMy loving lord, Dumaine is mortified.\nThe grosser manner of these world’s delights\nHe throws upon the gross world’s baser slaves.\nTo love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,\nWith all these living in philosophy.\n\n[He signs.]\n\nBEROWNE.\nI can but say their protestation over.\nSo much, dear liege, I have already sworn,\nThat is, to live and study here three years.\nBut there are other strict observances:\nAs not to see a woman in that term,\nWhich I hope well is not enrolled there;\nAnd one day in a week to touch no food,\nAnd but one meal on every day beside,\nThe which I hope is not enrolled there;\nAnd then to sleep but three hours in the night,\nAnd not be seen to wink of all the day,\nWhen I was wont to think no harm all night,\nAnd make a dark night too of half the day,\nWhich I hope well is not enrolled there.\nO, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,\nNot to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.\n\nKING.\nYour oath is passed to pass away from these.\n\nBEROWNE.\nLet me say no, my liege, an if you please.\nI only swore to study with your Grace\nAnd stay here in your court for three years’ space.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nYou swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.\n\nBEROWNE.\nBy yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.\nWhat is the end of study, let me know?\n\nKING.\nWhy, that to know which else we should not know.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThings hid and barred, you mean, from common sense?\n\nKING.\nAy, that is study’s god-like recompense.\n\nBEROWNE.\nCome on, then, I will swear to study so,\nTo know the thing I am forbid to know:\nAs thus, to study where I well may dine,\n    When I to feast expressly am forbid;\nOr study where to meet some mistress fine,\n    When mistresses from common sense are hid;\nOr, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,\nStudy to break it, and not break my troth.\nIf study’s gain be thus, and this be so,\nStudy knows that which yet it doth not know.\nSwear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.\n\nKING.\nThese be the stops that hinder study quite,\nAnd train our intellects to vain delight.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhy, all delights are vain, but that most vain\nWhich, with pain purchased, doth inherit pain:\nAs painfully to pore upon a book\n    To seek the light of truth, while truth the while\nDoth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.\n    Light seeking light doth light of light beguile;\nSo, ere you find where light in darkness lies,\nYour light grows dark by losing of your eyes.\nStudy me how to please the eye indeed\n    By fixing it upon a fairer eye,\nWho dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,\n    And give him light that it was blinded by.\nStudy is like the heaven’s glorious sun,\n    That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks;\nSmall have continual plodders ever won,\n    Save base authority from others’ books.\nThese earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,\n    That give a name to every fixed star,\nHave no more profit of their shining nights\n    Than those that walk and wot not what they are.\nToo much to know is to know naught but fame,\nAnd every godfather can give a name.\n\nKING.\nHow well he’s read, to reason against reading.\n\nDUMAINE.\nProceeded well, to stop all good proceeding.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nHe weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThe spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.\n\nDUMAINE.\nHow follows that?\n\nBEROWNE.\nFit in his place and time.\n\nDUMAINE.\nIn reason nothing.\n\nBEROWNE.\nSomething then in rhyme.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nBerowne is like an envious sneaping frost\nThat bites the first-born infants of the spring.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWell, say I am. Why should proud summer boast\nBefore the birds have any cause to sing?\nWhy should I joy in any abortive birth?\nAt Christmas I no more desire a rose\nThan wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows,\nBut like of each thing that in season grows.\nSo you, to study now it is too late,\nClimb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.\n\nKING.\nWell, sit you out. Go home, Berowne. Adieu.\n\nBEROWNE.\nNo, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you,\nAnd though I have for barbarism spoke more\n    Than for that angel knowledge you can say,\nYet confident I’ll keep what I have sworn\n    And bide the penance of each three years’ day.\nGive me the paper, let me read the same,\nAnd to the strictest decrees I’ll write my name.\n\nKING.\nHow well this yielding rescues thee from shame.\n\nBEROWNE.\n[Reads.] Item, That no woman shall come within a mile of my court. Hath this been proclaimed?\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nFour days ago.\n\nBEROWNE.\nLet’s see the penalty. [Reads.] On pain of losing her tongue. Who devised this penalty?\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nMarry, that did I.\n\nBEROWNE.\nSweet lord, and why?\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nTo fright them hence with that dread penalty.\n\nBEROWNE.\nA dangerous law against gentility.\n[Reads.] Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.\nThis article, my liege, yourself must break,\n    For well you know here comes in embassy\nThe French King’s daughter, with yourself to speak—\n    A mild of grace and complete majesty—\nAbout surrender up of Aquitaine\n    To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father.\nTherefore this article is made in vain,\n    Or vainly comes th’ admired Princess hither.\n\nKING.\nWhat say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.\n\nBEROWNE.\nSo study evermore is overshot.\nWhile it doth study to have what it would,\nIt doth forget to do the thing it should;\nAnd when it hath the thing it hunteth most,\n’Tis won as towns with fire: so won, so lost.\n\nKING.\nWe must of force dispense with this decree.\nShe must lie here on mere necessity.\n\nBEROWNE.\nNecessity will make us all forsworn\nThree thousand times within this three years’ space;\nFor every man with his affects is born,\nNot by might mastered, but by special grace.\nIf I break faith, this word shall speak for me:\nI am forsworn on mere necessity.\nSo to the laws at large I write my name,\nAnd he that breaks them in the least degree\nStands in attainder of eternal shame.\nSuggestions are to other as to me;\nBut I believe, although I seem so loath,\nI am the last that will last keep his oath.\n\n[He signs.]\n\nBut is there no quick recreation granted?\n\nKING.\nAy, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted\nWith a refined traveller of Spain,\nA man in all the world’s new fashion planted,\nThat hath a mint of phrases in his brain;\nOne who the music of his own vain tongue\nDoth ravish like enchanting harmony,\nA man of complements, whom right and wrong\nHave chose as umpire of their mutiny.\nThis child of fancy, that Armado hight,\nFor interim to our studies shall relate\nIn high-born words the worth of many a knight\nFrom tawny Spain lost in the world’s debate.\nHow you delight, my lords, I know not, I,\nBut I protest I love to hear him lie,\nAnd I will use him for my minstrelsy.\n\nBEROWNE.\nArmado is a most illustrious wight,\nA man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nCostard the swain and he shall be our sport,\nAnd so to study three years is but short.\n\nEnter Dull, a Constable, with a letter, and Costard.\n\nDULL.\nWhich is the Duke’s own person?\n\nBEROWNE.\nThis, fellow. What wouldst?\n\nDULL.\nI myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace’s farborough. But I would see his own person in flesh and blood.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThis is he.\n\nDULL.\nSignior Arm… Arm… commends you. There’s villainy abroad. This letter will tell you more.\n\nCOSTARD.\nSir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.\n\nKING.\nA letter from the magnificent Armado.\n\nBEROWNE.\nHow long soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nA high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!\n\nBEROWNE.\nTo hear, or forbear laughing?\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nTo hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately, or to forbear both.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWell, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness.\n\nCOSTARD.\nThe matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.\n\nBEROWNE.\nIn what manner?\n\nCOSTARD.\nIn manner and form following, sir, all those three. I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following her into the park, which, put together, is “in manner and form following”. Now, sir, for the manner. It is the manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form—in some form.\n\nBEROWNE.\nFor the “following”, sir?\n\nCOSTARD.\nAs it shall follow in my correction, and God defend the right!\n\nKING.\nWill you hear this letter with attention?\n\nBEROWNE.\nAs we would hear an oracle.\n\nCOSTARD.\nSuch is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] Great deputy, the welkin’s vicegerent and sole dominator of\nNavarre, my soul’s earth’s god and body’s fostering patron—\n\nCOSTARD.\nNot a word of Costard yet.\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] So it is—\n\nCOSTARD.\nIt may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so.\n\nKING.\nPeace!\n\nCOSTARD.\nBe to me, and every man that dares not fight.\n\nKING.\nNo words!\n\nCOSTARD.\nOf other men’s secrets, I beseech you.\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk. The time when? About the sixth hour, when beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper. So much for the time when. Now for the ground which? Which, I mean, I walked upon. It is ycleped thy park. Then for the place, where? Where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene and most preposterous event that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest. But to the place where? It standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain, that base minnow of thy mirth—\n\nCOSTARD.\nMe?\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] That unlettered small-knowing soul—\n\nCOSTARD.\nMe?\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] That shallow vassal—\n\nCOSTARD.\nStill me?\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] Which, as I remember, hight Costard—\n\nCOSTARD.\nO me!\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] Sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon, which with, O, with—but with this I passion to say wherewith—\n\nCOSTARD.\nWith a wench.\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] With a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a woman. Him, I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on, have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment, by thy sweet Grace’s officer, Antony Dull, a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.\n\nDULL.\nMe, an’t shall please you; I am Antony Dull.\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] For Jaquenetta, so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain, I keep her as a vessel of thy law’s fury, and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and heartburning heat of duty,\n                    Don Adriano de Armado.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThis is not so well as I looked for, but the best that ever I heard.\n\nKING.\nAy, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to this?\n\nCOSTARD.\nSir, I confess the wench.\n\nKING.\nDid you hear the proclamation?\n\nCOSTARD.\nI do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it.\n\nKING.\nIt was proclaimed a year’s imprisonment to be taken with a wench.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI was taken with none, sir. I was taken with a damsel.\n\nKING.\nWell, it was proclaimed “damsel”.\n\nCOSTARD.\nThis was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.\n\nKING.\nIt is so varied too, for it was proclaimed “virgin”.\n\nCOSTARD.\nIf it were, I deny her virginity. I was taken with a maid.\n\nKING.\nThis maid will not serve your turn, sir.\n\nCOSTARD.\nThis maid will serve my turn, sir.\n\nKING.\nSir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with bran and water.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.\n\nKING.\nAnd Don Armado shall be your keeper.\nMy Lord Berowne, see him delivered o’er;\nAnd go we, lords, to put in practice that\nWhich each to other hath so strongly sworn.\n\n[Exeunt King, Longaville and Dumaine.]\n\nBEROWNE.\nI’ll lay my head to any good man’s hat\nThese oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.\nSirrah, come on.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl. And therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again, and till then, sit thee down, sorrow.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. The park\nEnter Armado and Moth, his Page.\n\nARMADO.\nBoy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?\n\nMOTH.\nA great sign, sir, that he will look sad.\n\nARMADO.\nWhy, sadness is one and the selfsame thing, dear imp.\n\nMOTH.\nNo, no, O Lord, sir, no.\n\nARMADO.\nHow canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?\n\nMOTH.\nBy a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.\n\nARMADO.\nWhy tough signior? Why tough signior?\n\nMOTH.\nWhy tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?\n\nARMADO.\nI spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.\n\nMOTH.\nAnd I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough.\n\nARMADO.\nPretty and apt.\n\nMOTH.\nHow mean you, sir? I pretty and my saying apt, or I apt, and my saying pretty?\n\nARMADO.\nThou pretty, because little.\n\nMOTH.\nLittle pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?\n\nARMADO.\nAnd therefore apt, because quick.\n\nMOTH.\nSpeak you this in my praise, master?\n\nARMADO.\nIn thy condign praise.\n\nMOTH.\nI will praise an eel with the same praise.\n\nARMADO.\nWhat, that an eel is ingenious?\n\nMOTH.\nThat an eel is quick.\n\nARMADO.\nI do say thou art quick in answers. Thou heat’st my blood.\n\nMOTH.\nI am answered, sir.\n\nARMADO.\nI love not to be crossed.\n\nMOTH.\n[Aside.] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.\n\nARMADO.\nI have promised to study three years with the Duke.\n\nMOTH.\nYou may do it in an hour, sir.\n\nARMADO.\nImpossible.\n\nMOTH.\nHow many is one thrice told?\n\nARMADO.\nI am ill at reckoning. It fitteth the spirit of a tapster.\n\nMOTH.\nYou are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.\n\nARMADO.\nI confess both. They are both the varnish of a complete man.\n\nMOTH.\nThen I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.\n\nARMADO.\nIt doth amount to one more than two.\n\nMOTH.\nWhich the base vulgar do call three.\n\nARMADO.\nTrue.\n\nMOTH.\nWhy, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here’s three studied ere ye’ll thrice wink. And how easy it is to put “years” to the word “three”, and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will tell you.\n\nARMADO.\nA most fine figure!\n\nMOTH.\n[Aside.] To prove you a cipher.\n\nARMADO.\nI will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What great men have been in love?\n\nMOTH.\nHercules, master.\n\nARMADO.\nMost sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.\n\nMOTH.\nSamson, master. He was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter, and he was in love.\n\nARMADO.\nO well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson’s love, my dear Moth?\n\nMOTH.\nA woman, master.\n\nARMADO.\nOf what complexion?\n\nMOTH.\nOf all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.\n\nARMADO.\nTell me precisely of what complexion.\n\nMOTH.\nOf the sea-water green, sir.\n\nARMADO.\nIs that one of the four complexions?\n\nMOTH.\nAs I have read, sir; and the best of them too.\n\nARMADO.\nGreen indeed is the colour of lovers. But to have a love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.\n\nMOTH.\nIt was so, sir, for she had a green wit.\n\nARMADO.\nMy love is most immaculate white and red.\n\nMOTH.\nMost maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours.\n\nARMADO.\nDefine, define, well-educated infant.\n\nMOTH.\nMy father’s wit and my mother’s tongue assist me!\n\nARMADO.\nSweet invocation of a child, most pretty, and pathetical!\n\nMOTH.\n  If she be made of white and red,\n     Her faults will ne’er be known;\n  For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,\n     And fears by pale white shown.\n  Then if she fear, or be to blame,\n     By this you shall not know,\n  For still her cheeks possess the same\n     Which native she doth owe.\nA dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.\n\nARMADO.\nIs there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?\n\nMOTH.\nThe world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.\n\nARMADO.\nI will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves well.\n\nMOTH.\n[Aside.] To be whipped: and yet a better love than my master.\n\nARMADO.\nSing, boy. My spirit grows heavy in love.\n\nMOTH.\nAnd that’s great marvel, loving a light wench.\n\nARMADO.\nI say, sing.\n\nMOTH.\nForbear till this company be past.\n\nEnter Costard the Clown, Dull the Constable and Jaquenetta a Wench.\n\nDULL.\nSir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and you must suffer him to take no delight, nor no penance, but he must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park. She is allowed for the dey-woman. Fare you well.\n\nARMADO.\nI do betray myself with blushing.—Maid.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nMan.\n\nARMADO.\nI will visit thee at the lodge.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nThat’s hereby.\n\nARMADO.\nI know where it is situate.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nLord, how wise you are!\n\nARMADO.\nI will tell thee wonders.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nWith that face?\n\nARMADO.\nI love thee.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nSo I heard you say.\n\nARMADO.\nAnd so, farewell.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nFair weather after you!\n\nDULL.\nCome, Jaquenetta, away.\n\n[Exeunt Dull and Jaquenetta.]\n\nARMADO.\nVillain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned.\n\nCOSTARD.\nWell, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach.\n\nARMADO.\nThou shalt be heavily punished.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly rewarded.\n\nARMADO.\nTake away this villain. Shut him up.\n\nMOTH.\nCome, you transgressing slave, away!\n\nCOSTARD.\nLet me not be pent up, sir. I will fast being loose.\n\nMOTH.\nNo, sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to prison.\n\nCOSTARD.\nWell, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see.\n\nMOTH.\nWhat shall some see?\n\nCOSTARD.\nNay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and therefore I can be quiet.\n\n[Exeunt Moth and Costard.]\n\nARMADO.\nI do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first and second cause will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello he regards not. His disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be still, drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.\n\n[Exit.]",

Is’t so?\n\nMARIA.\nThey say so most that most his humours know.\n\nPRINCESS.\nSuch short-lived wits do wither as they grow.\nWho are the rest?\n\nKATHARINE.\nThe young Dumaine, a well-accomplished youth,\nOf all that virtue love for virtue loved;\nMost power to do most harm, least knowing ill,\nFor he hath wit to make an ill shape good,\nAnd shape to win grace though he had no wit.\nI saw him at the Duke Alençon’s once;\nAnd much too little of that good I saw\nIs my report to his great worthiness.\n\nROSALINE.\nAnother of these students at that time\nWas there with him, if I have heard a truth.\nBerowne they call him, but a merrier man,\nWithin the limit of becoming mirth,\nI never spent an hour’s talk withal.\nHis eye begets occasion for his wit,\nFor every object that the one doth catch\nThe other turns to a mirth-moving jest,\nWhich his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor,\nDelivers in such apt and gracious words\nThat aged ears play truant at his tales,\nAnd younger hearings are quite ravished,\nSo sweet and voluble is his discourse.\n\nPRINCESS.\nGod bless my ladies! Are they all in love,\nThat every one her own hath garnished\nWith such bedecking ornaments of praise?\n\nLORD.\nHere comes Boyet.\n\nEnter Boyet.\n\nPRINCESS.\nNow, what admittance, lord?\n\nBOYET.\nNavarre had notice of your fair approach,\nAnd he and his competitors in oath\nWere all addressed to meet you, gentle lady,\nBefore I came. Marry, thus much I have learned:\nHe rather means to lodge you in the field,\nLike one that comes here to besiege his court,\nThan seek a dispensation for his oath,\nTo let you enter his unpeopled house.\n\nEnter King of Navarre, Longaville, Dumaine, Berowne and Attendants.\n\nHere comes Navarre.\n\nKING.\nFair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.\n\nPRINCESS.\n“Fair” I give you back again, and “welcome” I have not yet. The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.\n\nKING.\nYou shall be welcome, madam, to my court.\n\nPRINCESS.\nI will be welcome then. Conduct me thither.\n\nKING.\nHear me, dear lady. I have sworn an oath.\n\nPRINCESS.\nOur Lady help my lord! He’ll be forsworn.\n\nKING.\nNot for the world, fair madam, by my will.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWhy, will shall break it; will, and nothing else.\n\nKING.\nYour ladyship is ignorant what it is.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWere my lord so, his ignorance were wise,\nWhere now his knowledge must prove ignorance.\nI hear your Grace hath sworn out housekeeping.\n’Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,\nAnd sin to break it.\nBut pardon me, I am too sudden bold.\nTo teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.\nVouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,\nAnd suddenly resolve me in my suit.\n\n[She gives him a paper.]\n\nKING.\nMadam, I will, if suddenly I may.\n\nPRINCESS.\nYou will the sooner that I were away,\nFor you’ll prove perjured if you make me stay.\n\n[The King reads the paper.]\n\nBEROWNE.\n[To Rosaline.] Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?\n\nROSALINE.\nDid not I dance with you in Brabant once?\n\nBEROWNE.\nI know you did.\n\nROSALINE.\nHow needless was it then\nTo ask the question!\n\nBEROWNE.\nYou must not be so quick.\n\nROSALINE.\n’Tis long of you that spur me with such questions.\n\nBEROWNE.\nYour wit’s too hot, it speeds too fast, ’twill tire.\n\nROSALINE.\nNot till it leave the rider in the mire.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhat time o’ day?\n\nROSALINE.\nThe hour that fools should ask.\n\nBEROWNE.\nNow fair befall your mask.\n\nROSALINE.\nFair fall the face it covers.\n\nBEROWNE.\nAnd send you many lovers!\n\nROSALINE.\nAmen, so you be none.\n\nBEROWNE.\nNay, then will I be gone.\n\nKING.\nMadam, your father here doth intimate\nThe payment of a hundred thousand crowns,\nBeing but the one half of an entire sum\nDisbursed by my father in his wars.\nBut say that he or we, as neither have,\nReceived that sum, yet there remains unpaid\nA hundred thousand more, in surety of the which\nOne part of Aquitaine is bound to us,\nAlthough not valued to the money’s worth.\nIf then the King your father will restore\nBut that one half which is unsatisfied,\nWe will give up our right in Aquitaine,\nAnd hold fair friendship with his majesty.\nBut that, it seems, he little purposeth;\nFor here he doth demand to have repaid\nA hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,\nOn payment of a hundred thousand crowns,\nTo have his title live in Aquitaine,\nWhich we much rather had depart withal,\nAnd have the money by our father lent,\nThan Aquitaine, so gelded as it is.\nDear Princess, were not his requests so far\nFrom reason’s yielding, your fair self should make\nA yielding ’gainst some reason in my breast,\nAnd go well satisfied to France again.\n\nPRINCESS.\nYou do the King my father too much wrong,\nAnd wrong the reputation of your name,\nIn so unseeming to confess receipt\nOf that which hath so faithfully been paid.\n\nKING.\nI do protest I never heard of it;\nAnd, if you prove it, I’ll repay it back\nOr yield up Aquitaine.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWe arrest your word.\nBoyet, you can produce acquittances\nFor such a sum from special officers\nOf Charles his father.\n\nKING.\nSatisfy me so.\n\nBOYET.\nSo please your Grace, the packet is not come\nWhere that and other specialties are bound.\nTomorrow you shall have a sight of them.\n\nKING.\nIt shall suffice me; at which interview\nAll liberal reason I will yield unto.\nMeantime receive such welcome at my hand\nAs honour, without breach of honour, may\nMake tender of to thy true worthiness.\nYou may not come, fair Princess, in my gates,\nBut here without you shall be so received\nAs you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,\nThough so denied fair harbour in my house.\nYour own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell.\nTomorrow shall we visit you again.\n\nPRINCESS.\nSweet health and fair desires consort your Grace.\n\nKING.\nThy own wish wish I thee in every place.\n\n[Exeunt the King, Longaville and Dumaine.]\n\nBEROWNE.\nLady, I will commend you to mine own heart.\n\nROSALINE.\nPray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.\n\nBEROWNE.\nI would you heard it groan.\n\nROSALINE.\nIs the fool sick?\n\nBEROWNE.\nSick at the heart.\n\nROSALINE.\nAlack, let it blood.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWould that do it good?\n\nROSALINE.\nMy physic says “ay”.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWill you prick’t with your eye?\n\nROSALINE.\nNon point, with my knife.\n\nBEROWNE.\nNow, God save thy life.\n\nROSALINE.\nAnd yours from long living.\n\nBEROWNE.\nI cannot stay thanksgiving.\n\n[He exits.]\n\nEnter Dumaine.\n\nDUMAINE.\nSir, I pray you, a word.

Boyet is disposed.\n\nBOYET.\nBut to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed.\nI only have made a mouth of his eye\nBy adding a tongue which I know will not lie.\n\nROSALINE.\nThou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully.\n\nMARIA.\nHe is Cupid’s grandfather, and learns news of him.\n\nROSALINE.\nThen was Venus like her mother; for her father is but grim.\n\nBOYET.\nDo you hear, my mad wenches?\n\nMARIA.\nNo.\n\nBOYET.\nWhat, then, do you see?\n\nROSALINE.\nAy, our way to be gone.\n\nBOYET.\nYou are too hard for me.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT III\nSCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park\nEnter Armado the Braggart and Moth his Boy.\n\nARMADO.\nWarble, child, make passionate my sense of hearing.\n\nMOTH.\n[Singing.]\nConcolinel.\n\nARMADO.\nSweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither. I must employ him in a letter to my love.\n\nMOTH.\nMaster, will you win your love with a French brawl?\n\nARMADO.\nHow meanest thou? Brawling in French?\n\nMOTH.\nNo, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue’s end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the shop of your eyes, with your arms crossed on your thin-belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away. These are compliments, these are humours; these betray nice wenches that would be betrayed without these; and make them men of note—do you note me?—that most are affected to these.\n\nARMADO.\nHow hast thou purchased this experience?\n\nMOTH.\nBy my penny of observation.\n\nARMADO.\nBut O—but O—\n\nMOTH.\n“The hobby-horse is forgot.”\n\nARMADO.\nCall’st thou my love “hobby-horse”?\n\nMOTH.\nNo, master. The hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?\n\nARMADO.\nAlmost I had.\n\nMOTH.\nNegligent student! Learn her by heart.\n\nARMADO.\nBy heart and in heart, boy.\n\nMOTH.\nAnd out of heart, master. All those three I will prove.\n\nARMADO.\nWhat wilt thou prove?\n\nMOTH.\nA man, if I live; and this, “by, in, and without,” upon the instant: “by” heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by her; “in” heart you love her, because your heart is in love with her; and “out” of heart you love her, being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her.\n\nARMADO.\nI am all these three.\n\nMOTH.\nAnd three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.\n\nARMADO.\nFetch hither the swain. He must carry me a letter.\n\nMOTH.\nA message well sympathized: a horse to be ambassador for an ass.\n\nARMADO.\nHa, ha, what sayest thou?\n\nMOTH.\nMarry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.\n\nARMADO.\nThe way is but short. Away!\n\nMOTH.\nAs swift as lead, sir.\n\nARMADO.\nThe meaning, pretty ingenious?\nIs not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?\n\nMOTH.\nMinime, honest master; or rather, master, no.\n\nARMADO.\nI say lead is slow.\n\nMOTH.\nYou are too swift, sir, to say so.\nIs that lead slow which is fired from a gun?\n\nARMADO.\nSweet smoke of rhetoric!\nHe reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that’s he.\nI shoot thee at the swain.\n\nMOTH.\nThump then, and I flee.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nARMADO.\nA most acute juvenal, voluble and free of grace!\nBy thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face.\nMost rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.\nMy herald is returned.\n\nEnter Moth and Costard.\n\nMOTH.\nA wonder, master! Here’s a costard broken in a shin.\n\nARMADO.\nSome enigma, some riddle. Come, thy l’envoi begin.\n\nCOSTARD.\nNo egma, no riddle, no l’envoi, no salve in the mail, sir. O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! No l’envoi, no l’envoi, no salve, sir, but a plantain.\n\nARMADO.\nBy virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l’envoi, and the word l’envoi for a salve?\n\nMOTH.\nDo the wise think them other? Is not l’envoi a salve?\n\nARMADO.\nNo, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain\nSome obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.\nI will example it:\n    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee\n    Were still at odds, being but three.\nThere’s the moral. Now the l’envoi.\n\nMOTH.\nI will add the l’envoi. Say the moral again.\n\nARMADO.\n    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee\n    Were still at odds, being but three.\n\nMOTH.\n    Until the goose came out of door,\n    And stayed the odds by adding four.\nNow will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my l’envoi.\n    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee\n    Were still at odds, being but three.\n\nARMADO.\n    Until the goose came out of door,\n    Staying the odds by adding four.\n\nMOTH.\nA good l’envoi, ending in the goose. Would you desire more?\n\nCOSTARD.\nThe boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that’s flat.\nSir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.\nTo sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose.\nLet me see: a fat l’envoi—ay, that’s a fat goose.\n\nARMADO.\nCome hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?\n\nMOTH.\nBy saying that a costard was broken in a shin.\nThen called you for the l’envoi.\n\nCOSTARD.\nTrue, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in. Then the boy’s fat l’envoi, the goose that you bought; and he ended the market.\n\nARMADO.\nBut tell me, how was there a costard broken in a shin?\n\nMOTH.\nI will tell you sensibly.\n\nCOSTARD.\nThou hast no feeling of it, Moth. I will speak that l’envoi.\n    I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,\n    Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.\n\nARMADO.\nWe will talk no more of this matter.\n\nCOSTARD.\nTill there be more matter in the shin.\n\nARMADO.\nSirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.\n\nCOSTARD.\nO, marry me to one Frances! I smell some l’envoi, some goose, in this.\n\nARMADO.\nBy my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy person. Thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound.\n\nCOSTARD.\nTrue, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me loose.\n\nARMADO.\nI give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance, and, in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: [Giving him a letter.] bear this significant to the country maid Jaquenetta. [Giving money.] There is remuneration for the best ward of mine honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nMOTH.\nLike the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.\n\n[Exit Moth.]\n\nCOSTARD.\nMy sweet ounce of man’s flesh, my incony Jew!\nNow will I look to his remuneration. “Remuneration”! O, that’s the Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings—remuneration. “What’s the price of this inkle?” “One penny.” “No, I’ll give you a remuneration.” Why, it carries it! Remuneration. Why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of this word.\n\nEnter Berowne.\n\nBEROWNE.\nMy good knave Costard, exceedingly well met.\n\nCOSTARD.\nPray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a remuneration?\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhat is a remuneration?\n\nCOSTARD.\nMarry, sir, halfpenny farthing.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhy, then, three-farthing worth of silk.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI thank your worship. God be wi’ you.\n\nBEROWNE.\nStay, slave. I must employ thee.\nAs thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,\nDo one thing for me that I shall entreat.\n\nCOSTARD.\nWhen would you have it done, sir?\n\nBEROWNE.\nThis afternoon.\n\nCOSTARD.\nWell, I will do it, sir. Fare you well.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThou knowest not what it is.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI shall know, sir, when I have done it.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhy, villain, thou must know first.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI will come to your worship tomorrow morning.\n\nBEROWNE.\nIt must be done this afternoon. Hark, slave, it is but this:\nThe Princess comes to hunt here in the park,\nAnd in her train there is a gentle lady;\nWhen tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,\nAnd Rosaline they call her. Ask for her\nAnd to her white hand see thou do commend\nThis sealed-up counsel.\n\n[Gives him money.]\n\nThere’s thy guerdon. Go.\n\nCOSTARD.\nGardon, O sweet gardon! Better than remuneration, a ’levenpence farthing better. Most sweet gardon! I will do it, sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBEROWNE.\nAnd I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love’s whip,\nA very beadle to a humorous sigh,\nA critic, nay, a night-watch constable,\nA domineering pedant o’er the boy,\nThan whom no mortal so magnificent!\nThis wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,\nThis Signior Junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid,\nRegent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,\nTh’ anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,\nLiege of all loiterers and malcontents,\nDread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,\nSole imperator, and great general\nOf trotting paritors—O my little heart!\nAnd I to be a corporal of his field\nAnd wear his colours like a tumbler’s hoop!\nWhat? I love, I sue, I seek a wife?\nA woman, that is like a German clock,\nStill a-repairing, ever out of frame,\nAnd never going aright, being a watch,\nBut being watched that it may still go right!\nNay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;\nAnd, among three, to love the worst of all,\nA whitely wanton with a velvet brow,\nWith two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;\nAy, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed\nThough Argus were her eunuch and her guard.\nAnd I to sigh for her, to watch for her,\nTo pray for her! Go to, it is a plague\nThat Cupid will impose for my neglect\nOf his almighty dreadful little might.\nWell, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan.\nSome men must love my lady, and some Joan.\n\n[Exit.]",

Now mercy goes to kill,\nAnd shooting well is then accounted ill.\nThus will I save my credit in the shoot:\nNot wounding, pity would not let me do’t;\nIf wounding, then it was to show my skill,\nThat more for praise than purpose meant to kill.\nAnd out of question so it is sometimes,\nGlory grows guilty of detested crimes,\nWhen, for fame’s sake, for praise, an outward part,\nWe bend to that the working of the heart;\nAs I for praise alone now seek to spill\nThe poor deer’s blood, that my heart means no ill.\n\nBOYET.\nDo not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty\nOnly for praise’ sake, when they strive to be\nLords o’er their lords?\n\nPRINCESS.\nOnly for praise; and praise we may afford\nTo any lady that subdues a lord.\n\nEnter Costard.\n\nBOYET.\nHere comes a member of the commonwealth.\n\nCOSTARD.\nGod dig-you-den all!

More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal.

He came, one; see, two; overcame, three. Who came? The King. Why did he come? To see. Why did he see? To overcome. To whom came he? To the beggar. What saw he? The beggar. Who overcame he? The beggar. The conclusion is victory. On whose side? The King’s. The captive is enriched. On whose side? The beggar’s. The catastrophe is a nuptial. On whose side? The King’s? No, on both in one, or one in both. I am the King, for so stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? Robes. For tittles? Titles. For thyself? Me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part.\n          Thine in the dearest design of industry,\n                    Don Adriano de Armado.\n\nThus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar\n    ’Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.\nSubmissive fall his princely feet before,\n    And he from forage will incline to play.\nBut if thou strive, poor soul, what are thou then?\nFood for his rage, repasture for his den.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWhat plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?\nWhat vane?

    "content":"SCENE II. The same\nEnter Dull, Holofernes, the Pedant and Nathaniel.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nVery reverend sport, truly, and done in the testimony of a good conscience.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nThe deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood, ripe as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven, and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra, the soil, the land, the earth.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nTruly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least. But, sir, I assure ye it was a buck of the first head.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nSir Nathaniel, haud credo.\n\nDULL.\n’Twas not a “auld grey doe”, ’twas a pricket.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nMost barbarous intimation! Yet a kind of insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of explication; facere, as it were, replication, or rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his inclination, after his undressed, unpolished, uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather, unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my haud credo for a deer.\n\nDULL.\nI said the deer was not a “auld grey doe”, ’twas a pricket.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nTwice-sod simplicity, bis coctus!\nO, thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!\n\nNATHANIEL.\nSir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred of a book.\nHe hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink.\nHis intellect is not replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in the duller parts.\nAnd such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be—\nWhich we of taste and feeling are—for those parts that do fructify in us more than he.\nFor as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,\nSo, were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school.\nBut, omne bene, say I, being of an old father’s mind;\nMany can brook the weather that love not the wind.\n\nDULL.\nYou two are bookmen. Can you tell me by your wit\nWhat was a month old at Cain’s birth, that’s not five weeks old as yet?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nDictynna, goodman Dull. Dictynna, goodman Dull.\n\nDULL.\nWhat is Dictynna?\n\nNATHANIEL.\nA title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nThe moon was a month old when Adam was no more,\nAnd raught not to five weeks when he came to five-score.\nTh’ allusion holds in the exchange.\n\nDULL.\n’Tis true, indeed. The collusion holds in the exchange.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nGod comfort thy capacity! I say, th’ allusion holds in the exchange.\n\nDULL.\nAnd I say the pollution holds in the exchange, for the moon is never but a month old; and I say beside that ’twas a pricket that the Princess killed.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nSir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer? And, to humour the ignorant, call I the deer the Princess killed a pricket.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nPerge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nI will something affect the letter; for it argues facility.\nThe preyful Princess pierced and pricked a pretty pleasing pricket;\nSome say a sore; but not a sore till now made sore with shooting.\nThe dogs did yell, put “l” to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket;\nOr pricket sore, or else sorel, the people fall a-hooting.\nIf sore be sore, then “L” to “sore” makes fifty sores o’ sorel.\nOf one sore I an hundred make, by adding but one more “L”.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nA rare talent!\n\nDULL.\n[Aside.] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nThis is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nSir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my parishioners, for their sons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit very greatly under you. You are a good member of the commonwealth.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nMehercle! If their sons be ingenious, they shall want no instruction; if their daughters be capable, I will put it to them. But, vir sapit qui pauca loquitur. A soul feminine saluteth us.\n\nEnter Jaquenetta and Costard.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nGod give you good morrow, Master Person.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nMaster Person, quasi pierce one. And if one should be pierced, which is the one?\n\nCOSTARD.\nMarry, Master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nOf piercing a hogshead! A good lustre or conceit in a turf of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a swine. ’Tis pretty; it is well.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nGood Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter. It was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech you read it.\n\n[Giving a letter to Nathaniel.]\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nFauste precor, gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra Ruminat—\nand so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan, I may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice:\n    Venetia, Venetia,\n    Chi non ti vede, non ti pretia.\nOld Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth thee not, loves thee not.\n[He sings.]\n    Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.\nUnder pardon, sir, what are the contents? Or rather as Horace says in his—What, my soul, verses?\n\nNATHANIEL.\nAy, sir, and very learned.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nLet me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse,\n    Lege, domine.\n\nNATHANIEL.\n[Reads.]\nIf love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?\n    Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed.\nThough to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll faithful prove.\n    Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.\nStudy his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,\n    Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend.\nIf knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice.\n    Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,\nAll ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;\n    Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire.\nThy eye Jove’s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,\n    Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.\nCelestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong,\nThat sings heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nYou find not the apostrophus, and so miss the accent. Let me supervise the canzonet. [He takes the letter.] Here are only numbers ratified, but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret. Ovidius Naso was the man. And why indeed “Naso,” but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing: so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper, the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin, was this directed to you?\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nAy, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange queen’s lords.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nI will overglance the superscript: To the snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline. I will look again on the intellect of the letter, for the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto: Your Ladyship’s in all desired employment, Berowne. Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one of the votaries with the King, and here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen’s, which accidentally, or by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my sweet, deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King. It may concern much. Stay not thy compliment. I forgive thy duty. Adieu.\n\nJAQUENETTA.\nGood Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life.\n\nCOSTARD.\nHave with thee, my girl.\n\n[Exeunt Costard and Jaquenetta.]\n\nNATHANIEL.\nSir, you have done this in the fear of God, very religiously; and, as a certain Father saith—\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nSir, tell not me of the Father, I do fear colourable colours. But to return to the verses: did they please you, Sir Nathaniel?\n\nNATHANIEL.\nMarvellous well for the pen.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nI do dine today at the father’s of a certain pupil of mine, where if, before repast, it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I will prove those verses to be very unlearned, neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention. I beseech your society.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nAnd thank you too; for society, saith the text, is the happiness of life.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nAnd certes, the text most infallibly concludes it. [To Dull.] Sir, I do invite you too. You shall not say me nay. Pauca verba. Away! The gentles are at their game, and we will to our recreation.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

They have pitched a toil; I am toiling in a pitch, pitch that defiles. Defile! A foul word! Well, set thee down, sorrow, for so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool. Well proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax. It kills sheep, it kills me, I a sheep. Well proved again, o’ my side! I will not love; if I do, hang me! I’ faith, I will not. O, but her eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to rhyme, and to be melancholy. And here is part of my rhyme, and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o’ my sonnets already. The clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it. Sweet clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a paper.

Why dost thou tear it?\n\nBEROWNE.\nA toy, my liege, a toy. Your Grace needs not fear it.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nIt did move him to passion, and therefore let’s hear it.\n\nDUMAINE.\n[Picking up the pieces.]\nIt is Berowne’s writing, and here is his name.\n\nBEROWNE.\n[To Costard.] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead, you were born to do me shame.\nGuilty, my lord, guilty.

Who sees the heavenly Rosaline\nThat, like a rude and savage man of Ind,\nAt the first op’ning of the gorgeous east,\nBows not his vassal head and, strucken blind,\nKisses the base ground with obedient breast?\nWhat peremptory eagle-sighted eye\nDares look upon the heaven of her brow\nThat is not blinded by her majesty?\n\nKING.\nWhat zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?\nMy love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;\nShe, an attending star, scarce seen a light.\n\nBEROWNE.\nMy eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.\nO, but for my love, day would turn to night!\nOf all complexions the culled sovereignty\nDo meet as at a fair in her fair cheek,\nWhere several worthies make one dignity,\nWhere nothing wants that want itself doth seek.\nLend me the flourish of all gentle tongues—\nFie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not.\nTo things of sale a seller’s praise belongs.\nShe passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.\nA withered hermit, five-score winters worn,\nMight shake off fifty, looking in her eye.\nBeauty doth varnish age, as if new born,\nAnd gives the crutch the cradle’s infancy.\nO, ’tis the sun that maketh all things shine!\n\nKING.\nBy heaven, thy love is black as ebony.\n\nBEROWNE.\nIs ebony like her? O word divine!\nA wife of such wood were felicity.\nO, who can give an oath? Where is a book?\nThat I may swear beauty doth beauty lack\nIf that she learn not of her eye to look.\nNo face is fair that is not full so black.\n\nKING.\nO paradox!

    "content":"ACT V\nSCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park\nEnter Holofernes, Sir Nathaniel and Dull.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nSatis quod sufficit.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nI praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious, pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the King’s, who is intituled, nominated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nNovi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nA most singular and choice epithet.\n\n[Draws out his table-book.]\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nHe draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and point-devise companions, such rackers of orthography, as to speak “dout” sine “b”, when he should say “doubt”, “det” when he should pronounce “debt”—d, e, b, t, not d, e, t. He clepeth a calf “cauf”, half “hauf”; neighbour vocatur “nebour”, neigh abbreviated “ne”. This is abhominable, which he would call “abominable”. It insinuateth me of insanie. Ne intelligis, domine? To make frantic, lunatic.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nLaus Deo, bone intelligo.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nBone? Bone for bene? Priscian a little scratched; ’twill serve.\n\nEnter Armado, Moth and Costard.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nVidesne quis venit?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nVideo, et gaudeo.\n\nARMADO.\nChirrah!\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nQuare “chirrah”, not “sirrah”?\n\nARMADO.\nMen of peace, well encountered.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nMost military sir, salutation.\n\nMOTH.\n[Aside to Costard.] They have been at a great feast of languages and stolen the scraps.\n\nCOSTARD.\nO, they have lived long on the almsbasket of words. I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word, for thou art not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus. Thou art easier swallowed than a flap-dragon.\n\nMOTH.\nPeace! The peal begins.\n\nARMADO.\n[To Holofernes.] Monsieur, are you not lettered?\n\nMOTH.\nYes, yes, he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a, b, spelt backward with the horn on his head?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nBa, pueritia, with a horn added.\n\nMOTH.\nBa, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nQuis, quis, thou consonant?\n\nMOTH.\nThe third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or the fifth, if I.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nI will repeat them: a, e, i—\n\nMOTH.\nThe sheep. The other two concludes it: o, u.\n\nARMADO.\nNow, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch, a quick venue of wit! Snip, snap, quick and home! It rejoiceth my intellect. True wit!\n\nMOTH.\nOffered by a child to an old man—which is wit-old.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nWhat is the figure? What is the figure?\n\nMOTH.\nHorns.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nThou disputes like an infant. Go whip thy gig.\n\nMOTH.\nLend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your infamy unum cita. A gig of a cuckold’s horn.\n\nCOSTARD.\nAn I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy gingerbread. Hold, there is the very remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me! Go to, thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers’ ends, as they say.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nO, I smell false Latin! Dunghill for unguem.\n\nARMADO.\nArts-man, preambulate. We will be singuled from the barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the charge-house on the top of the mountain?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nOr mons, the hill.\n\nARMADO.\nAt your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nI do, sans question.\n\nARMADO.\nSir, it is the King’s most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the Princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the rude multitude call the afternoon.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nThe posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable for the afternoon. The word is well culled, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.\n\nARMADO.\nSir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure ye, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee, remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy head. And among other importunate and most serious designs, and of great import indeed, too—but let that pass. For I must tell thee it will please his Grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio. But, sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable! Some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world. But let that pass. The very all of all is—but, sweet heart, I do implore secrecy—that the King would have me present the Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antic, or firework. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking-out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to crave your assistance.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nSir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies. Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by our assistance, the King’s command, and this most gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princess, I say, none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nWhere will you find men worthy enough to present them?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nJoshua, yourself; myself; and this gallant gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus. This swain, because of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules.\n\nARMADO.\nPardon, sir; error. He is not quantity enough for that Worthy’s thumb; he is not so big as the end of his club.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nShall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in minority. His enter and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.\n\nMOTH.\nAn excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may cry “Well done, Hercules, now thou crushest the snake!” That is the way to make an offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.\n\nARMADO.\nFor the rest of the Worthies?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nI will play three myself.\n\nMOTH.\nThrice-worthy gentleman!\n\nARMADO.\nShall I tell you a thing?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nWe attend.\n\nARMADO.\nWe will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I beseech you, follow.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nVia, goodman Dull! Thou has spoken no word all this while.\n\nDULL.\nNor understood none neither, sir.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nAllons! we will employ thee.\n\nDULL.\nI’ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play on the tabor to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nMost dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. The same. Before the Princess’s pavilion\nEnter the Princess, Rosaline, Katharine and Maria.\n\nPRINCESS.\nSweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,\nIf fairings come thus plentifully in.\nA lady walled about with diamonds!\nLook you what I have from the loving King.\n\nROSALINE.\nMadam, came nothing else along with that?\n\nPRINCESS.\nNothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme\nAs would be crammed up in a sheet of paper\nWrit o’ both sides the leaf, margent and all,\nThat he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name.\n\nROSALINE.\nThat was the way to make his godhead wax,\nFor he hath been five thousand years a boy.\n\nKATHARINE.\nAy, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.\n\nROSALINE.\nYou’ll ne’er be friends with him. He killed your sister.\n\nKATHARINE.\nHe made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;\nAnd so she died. Had she been light, like you,\nOf such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,\nShe might ha’ been a grandam ere she died.\nAnd so may you, for a light heart lives long.\n\nROSALINE.\nWhat’s your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?\n\nKATHARINE.\nA light condition in a beauty dark.\n\nROSALINE.\nWe need more light to find your meaning out.\n\nKATHARINE.\nYou’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff;\nTherefore I’ll darkly end the argument.\n\nROSALINE.\nLook what you do, you do it still i’ th’ dark.\n\nKATHARINE.\nSo do not you, for you are a light wench.\n\nROSALINE.\nIndeed, I weigh not you, and therefore light.\n\nKATHARINE.\nYou weigh me not? O, that’s you care not for me.\n\nROSALINE.\nGreat reason, for past cure is still past care.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWell bandied both; a set of wit well played.\nBut, Rosaline, you have a favour too.\nWho sent it? And what is it?\n\nROSALINE.\nI would you knew.\nAn if my face were but as fair as yours,\nMy favour were as great. Be witness this.\nNay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne;\nThe numbers true, and, were the numbering too,\nI were the fairest goddess on the ground.\nI am compared to twenty thousand fairs.\nO, he hath drawn my picture in his letter.\n\nPRINCESS.\nAnything like?\n\nROSALINE.\nMuch in the letters, nothing in the praise.\n\nPRINCESS.\nBeauteous as ink: a good conclusion.\n\nKATHARINE.\nFair as a text B in a copy-book.\n\nROSALINE.\n’Ware pencils, how! Let me not die your debtor,\nMy red dominical, my golden letter.\nO, that your face were not so full of O’s!\n\nPRINCESS.\nA pox of that jest! And beshrew all shrews.\nBut, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumaine?\n\nKATHARINE.\nMadam, this glove.\n\nPRINCESS.\nDid he not send you twain?\n\nKATHARINE.\nYes, madam, and moreover,\nSome thousand verses of a faithful lover.\nA huge translation of hypocrisy,\nVilely compiled, profound simplicity.\n\nMARIA.\nThis, and these pearls, to me sent Longaville.\nThe letter is too long by half a mile.\n\nPRINCESS.\nI think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart\nThe chain were longer and the letter short?\n\nMARIA.\nAy, or I would these hands might never part.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWe are wise girls to mock our lovers so.\n\nROSALINE.\nThey are worse fools to purchase mocking so.\nThat same Berowne I’ll torture ere I go.\nO that I knew he were but in by th’ week!\nHow I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,\nAnd wait the season, and observe the times,\nAnd spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,\nAnd shape his service wholly to my hests,\nAnd make him proud to make me proud that jests!\nSo pair-taunt-like would I o’ersway his state,\nThat he should be my fool, and I his fate.\n\nPRINCESS.\nNone are so surely caught, when they are catched,\nAs wit turned fool. Folly, in wisdom hatched,\nHath wisdom’s warrant and the help of school\nAnd wit’s own grace to grace a learned fool.\n\nROSALINE.\nThe blood of youth burns not with such excess\nAs gravity’s revolt to wantonness.\n\nMARIA.\nFolly in fools bears not so strong a note\nAs fool’ry in the wise when wit doth dote,\nSince all the power thereof it doth apply\nTo prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.\n\nEnter Boyet.\n\nPRINCESS.\nHere comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.\n\nBOYET.\nO, I am stabbed with laughter! Where’s her Grace?\n\nPRINCESS.\nThy news, Boyet?\n\nBOYET.\nPrepare, madam, prepare!\nArm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are\nAgainst your peace. Love doth approach disguised,\nArmed in arguments. You’ll be surprised.\nMuster your wits, stand in your own defence,\nOr hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.\n\nPRINCESS.\nSaint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they\nThat charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.\n\nBOYET.\nUnder the cool shade of a sycamore\nI thought to close mine eyes some half an hour,\nWhen, lo, to interrupt my purposed rest,\nToward that shade I might behold addressed\nThe King and his companions. Warily\nI stole into a neighbour thicket by,\nAnd overheard what you shall overhear:\nThat, by and by, disguised they will be here.\nTheir herald is a pretty knavish page\nThat well by heart hath conned his embassage.\nAction and accent did they teach him there:\n“Thus must thou speak,” and “thus thy body bear.”\nAnd ever and anon they made a doubt\nPresence majestical would put him out;\n“For,” quoth the King, “an angel shalt thou see;\nYet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.”\nThe boy replied “An angel is not evil;\nI should have feared her had she been a devil.”\nWith that all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder,\nMaking the bold wag by their praises bolder.\nOne rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered, and swore\nA better speech was never spoke before.\nAnother with his finger and his thumb\nCried “Via, we will do ’t, come what will come.”\nThe third he capered, and cried “All goes well!”\nThe fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell.\nWith that they all did tumble on the ground,\nWith such a zealous laughter, so profound,\nThat in this spleen ridiculous appears,\nTo check their folly, passion’s solemn tears.\n\nPRINCESS.\nBut what, but what, come they to visit us?\n\nBOYET.\nThey do, they do, and are apparelled thus,\nLike Muscovites, or Russians, as I guess.\nTheir purpose is to parley, court, and dance,\nAnd every one his love-feat will advance\nUnto his several mistress, which they’ll know\nBy favours several which they did bestow.\n\nPRINCESS.\nAnd will they so? The gallants shall be tasked;\nFor, ladies, we will every one be masked,\nAnd not a man of them shall have the grace,\nDespite of suit, to see a lady’s face.\nHold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,\nAnd then the King will court thee for his dear.\nHold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,\nSo shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.\nAnd change you favours too; so shall your loves\nWoo contrary, deceived by these removes.\n\nROSALINE.\nCome on, then, wear the favours most in sight.\n\nKATHARINE.\nBut in this changing, what is your intent?\n\nPRINCESS.\nThe effect of my intent is to cross theirs.\nThey do it but in mocking merriment,\nAnd mock for mock is only my intent.\nTheir several counsels they unbosom shall\nTo loves mistook, and so be mocked withal\nUpon the next occasion that we meet,\nWith visages displayed to talk and greet.\n\nROSALINE.\nBut shall we dance, if they desire us to’t?\n\nPRINCESS.\nNo, to the death we will not move a foot,\nNor to their penned speech render we no grace,\nBut while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.\n\nBOYET.\nWhy, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart,\nAnd quite divorce his memory from his part.\n\nPRINCESS.\nTherefore I do it, and I make no doubt\nThe rest will ne’er come in, if he be out.\nThere’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,\nTo make theirs ours and ours none but our own.\nSo shall we stay, mocking intended game,\nAnd they, well mocked, depart away with shame.\n\n[Sound trumpet, within.]\n\nBOYET.\nThe trumpet sounds. Be masked; the maskers come.\n\n[The Ladies mask.]\n\nEnter Blackamoors with music, Moth, with a speech, the King, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine disguised.\n\nMOTH.\nAll hail, the richest beauties on the earth!\n\nBOYET.\nBeauties no richer than rich taffeta.\n\nMOTH.\nA holy parcel of the fairest dames\n\n[The Ladies turn their backs to him.]\n\nThat ever turned their—backs—to mortal views!\n\nBEROWNE.\nTheir eyes, villain, their eyes.\n\nMOTH.\nThat ever turned their eyes to mortal views.\nOut—\n\nBOYET.\nTrue; out indeed.\n\nMOTH.\nOut of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe\nNot to behold—\n\nBEROWNE.\nOnce to behold, rogue!\n\nMOTH.\nOnce to behold with your sun-beamed eyes—\nWith your sun-beamed eyes—\n\nBOYET.\nThey will not answer to that epithet.\nYou were best call it “daughter-beamed eyes”.\n\nMOTH.\nThey do not mark me, and that brings me out.\n\nBEROWNE.\nIs this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue!\n\n[Exit Moth.]\n\nROSALINE.\nWhat would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.\nIf they do speak our language, ’tis our will\nThat some plain man recount their purposes.\nKnow what they would.\n\nBOYET.\nWhat would you with the Princess?\n\nBEROWNE.\nNothing but peace and gentle visitation.\n\nROSALINE.\nWhat would they, say they?\n\nBOYET.\nNothing but peace and gentle visitation.\n\nROSALINE.\nWhy, that they have, and bid them so be gone.\n\nBOYET.\nShe says you have it, and you may be gone.\n\nKING.\nSay to her we have measured many miles\nTo tread a measure with her on this grass.\n\nBOYET.\nThey say that they have measured many a mile\nTo tread a measure with you on this grass.\n\nROSALINE.\nIt is not so. Ask them how many inches\nIs in one mile? If they have measured many,\nThe measure then of one is easily told.\n\nBOYET.\nIf to come hither you have measured miles,\nAnd many miles, the Princess bids you tell\nHow many inches doth fill up one mile.\n\nBEROWNE.\nTell her we measure them by weary steps.\n\nBOYET.\nShe hears herself.\n\nROSALINE.\nHow many weary steps\nOf many weary miles you have o’ergone\nAre numbered in the travel of one mile?\n\nBEROWNE.\nWe number nothing that we spend for you.\nOur duty is so rich, so infinite,\nThat we may do it still without account.\nVouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,\nThat we, like savages, may worship it.\n\nROSALINE.\nMy face is but a moon, and clouded too.\n\nKING.\nBlessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!\nVouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,\nThose clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.\n\nROSALINE.\nO vain petitioner! Beg a greater matter!\nThou now requests but moonshine in the water.\n\nKING.\nThen in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.\nThou bidd’st me beg; this begging is not strange.\n\nROSALINE.\nPlay, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.\n\n[Music plays.]\n\nNot yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.\n\nKING.\nWill you not dance? How come you thus estranged?\n\nROSALINE.\nYou took the moon at full, but now she’s changed.\n\nKING.\nYet still she is the moon, and I the man.\nThe music plays, vouchsafe some motion to it.\n\nROSALINE.\nOur ears vouchsafe it.\n\nKING.\nBut your legs should do it.\n\nROSALINE.\nSince you are strangers and come here by chance,\nWe’ll not be nice. Take hands. We will not dance.\n\nKING.\nWhy take we hands then?\n\nROSALINE.\nOnly to part friends.\nCurtsy, sweet hearts, and so the measure ends.\n\nKING.\nMore measure of this measure! Be not nice.\n\nROSALINE.\nWe can afford no more at such a price.\n\nKING.\nPrice you yourselves? What buys your company?\n\nROSALINE.\nYour absence only.\n\nKING.\nThat can never be.\n\nROSALINE.\nThen cannot we be bought. And so adieu—\nTwice to your visor, and half once to you!\n\nKING.\nIf you deny to dance, let’s hold more chat.\n\nROSALINE.\nIn private then.\n\nKING.\nI am best pleased with that.\n\n[They converse apart.]\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhite-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.\n\nPRINCESS.\nHoney, and milk, and sugar: there is three.\n\nBEROWNE.\nNay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,\nMetheglin, wort, and malmsey. Well run, dice!\nThere’s half a dozen sweets.\n\nPRINCESS.\nSeventh sweet, adieu.\nSince you can cog, I’ll play no more with you.\n\nBEROWNE.\nOne word in secret.\n\nPRINCESS.\nLet it not be sweet.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThou griev’st my gall.\n\nPRINCESS.\nGall! Bitter.\n\nBEROWNE.\nTherefore meet.\n\n[They converse apart.]\n\nDUMAINE.\nWill you vouchsafe with me to change a word?\n\nMARIA.\nName it.\n\nDUMAINE.\nFair lady—\n\nMARIA.\nSay you so? Fair lord!\nTake that for your “fair lady”.\n\nDUMAINE.\nPlease it you,\nAs much in private, and I’ll bid adieu.\n\n[They converse apart.]\n\nKATHARINE.\nWhat, was your visor made without a tongue?\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nI know the reason, lady, why you ask.\n\nKATHARINE.\nO, for your reason! Quickly, sir, I long.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nYou have a double tongue within your mask,\nAnd would afford my speechless visor half.\n\nKATHARINE.\n“Veal”, quoth the Dutchman. Is not veal a calf?\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nA calf, fair lady?\n\nKATHARINE.\nNo, a fair lord calf.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nLet’s part the word.\n\nKATHARINE.\nNo, I’ll not be your half.\nTake all and wean it; it may prove an ox.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nLook how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks.\nWill you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so.\n\nKATHARINE.\nThen die a calf before your horns do grow.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nOne word in private with you ere I die.\n\nKATHARINE.\nBleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.\n\n[They converse apart.]\n\nBOYET.\nThe tongues of mocking wenches are as keen\n    As is the razor’s edge invisible,\nCutting a smaller hair than may be seen;\n    Above the sense of sense, so sensible\nSeemeth their conference. Their conceits have wings\nFleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.\n\nROSALINE.\nNot one word more, my maids; break off, break off.\n\nBEROWNE.\nBy heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!\n\nKING.\nFarewell, mad wenches. You have simple wits.\n\n[Exeunt King, Lords and Blackamoors.]\n\nPRINCESS.\nTwenty adieus, my frozen Muscovites.\nAre these the breed of wits so wondered at?\n\nBOYET.\nTapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed out.\n\nROSALINE.\nWell-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.\n\nPRINCESS.\nO poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!\nWill they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?\nOr ever but in vizors show their faces?\nThis pert Berowne was out of countenance quite.\n\nROSALINE.\nThey were all in lamentable cases.\nThe King was weeping-ripe for a good word.\n\nPRINCESS.\nBerowne did swear himself out of all suit.\n\nMARIA.\nDumaine was at my service, and his sword.\n“Non point,” quoth I; my servant straight was mute.\n\nKATHARINE.\nLord Longaville said I came o’er his heart;\nAnd trow you what he called me?\n\nPRINCESS.\nQualm, perhaps.\n\nKATHARINE.\nYes, in good faith.\n\nPRINCESS.\nGo, sickness as thou art!\n\nROSALINE.\nWell, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.\nBut will you hear? The King is my love sworn.\n\nPRINCESS.\nAnd quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.\n\nKATHARINE.\nAnd Longaville was for my service born.\n\nMARIA.\nDumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.\n\nBOYET.\nMadam, and pretty mistresses, give ear.\nImmediately they will again be here\nIn their own shapes, for it can never be\nThey will digest this harsh indignity.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWill they return?\n\nBOYET.\nThey will, they will, God knows,\nAnd leap for joy, though they are lame with blows.\nTherefore, change favours and, when they repair,\nBlow like sweet roses in this summer air.\n\nPRINCESS.\nHow “blow”? How “blow”? Speak to be understood.\n\nBOYET.\nFair ladies masked are roses in their bud.\nDismasked, their damask sweet commixture shown,\nAre angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.\n\nPRINCESS.\nAvaunt, perplexity! What shall we do\nIf they return in their own shapes to woo?\n\nROSALINE.\nGood madam, if by me you’ll be advised,\nLet’s mock them still, as well known as disguised.\nLet us complain to them what fools were here,\nDisguised like Muscovites in shapeless gear;\nAnd wonder what they were, and to what end\nTheir shallow shows and prologue vilely penned,\nAnd their rough carriage so ridiculous,\nShould be presented at our tent to us.\n\nBOYET.\nLadies, withdraw. The gallants are at hand.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWhip to our tents, as roes run o’er the land.\n\n[Exeunt Princess, Rosaline, Katharine and Maria.]\n\nEnter the King, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine as themselves.\n\nKING.\nFair sir, God save you. Where’s the Princess?\n\nBOYET.\nGone to her tent. Please it your Majesty\nCommand me any service to her thither?\n\nKING.\nThat she vouchsafe me audience for one word.\n\nBOYET.\nI will; and so will she, I know, my lord.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBEROWNE.\nThis fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas\nAnd utters it again when God doth please.\nHe is wit’s pedlar, and retails his wares\nAt wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;\nAnd we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,\nHave not the grace to grace it with such show.\nThis gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve.\nHad he been Adam, he had tempted Eve.\nHe can carve too, and lisp. Why, this is he\nThat kissed his hand away in courtesy.\nThis is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,\nThat, when he plays at tables, chides the dice\nIn honourable terms. Nay, he can sing\nA mean most meanly; and in ushering\nMend him who can. The ladies call him sweet.\nThe stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.\nThis is the flower that smiles on everyone,\nTo show his teeth as white as whale’s bone;\nAnd consciences that will not die in debt\nPay him the due of “honey-tongued Boyet”.\n\nKING.\nA blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,\nThat put Armado’s page out of his part!\n\nEnter the Princess, Rosaline, Maria, Katharine with Boyet.\n\nBEROWNE.\nSee where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou\nTill this man showed thee, and what art thou now?\n\nKING.\nAll hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day.\n\nPRINCESS.\n“Fair” in “all hail” is foul, as I conceive.\n\nKING.\nConstrue my speeches better, if you may.\n\nPRINCESS.\nThen wish me better. I will give you leave.\n\nKING.\nWe came to visit you, and purpose now\nTo lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it then.\n\nPRINCESS.\nThis field shall hold me, and so hold your vow.\nNor God nor I delights in perjured men.\n\nKING.\nRebuke me not for that which you provoke.\nThe virtue of your eye must break my oath.\n\nPRINCESS.\nYou nickname virtue: “vice” you should have spoke;\nFor virtue’s office never breaks men’s troth.\nNow by my maiden honour, yet as pure\nAs the unsullied lily, I protest,\nA world of torments though I should endure,\nI would not yield to be your house’s guest,\nSo much I hate a breaking cause to be\nOf heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.\n\nKING.\nO, you have lived in desolation here,\nUnseen, unvisited, much to our shame.\n\nPRINCESS.\nNot so, my lord. It is not so, I swear.\nWe have had pastimes here and pleasant game.\nA mess of Russians left us but of late.\n\nKING.\nHow, madam? Russians?\n\nPRINCESS.\nAy, in truth, my lord.\nTrim gallants, full of courtship and of state.\n\nROSALINE.\nMadam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.\nMy lady, to the manner of the days,\nIn courtesy gives undeserving praise.\nWe four indeed confronted were with four\nIn Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour\nAnd talked apace; and in that hour, my lord,\nThey did not bless us with one happy word.\nI dare not call them fools; but this I think,\nWhen they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThis jest is dry to me. My gentle sweet,\nYour wit makes wise things foolish. When we greet,\nWith eyes’ best seeing, heaven’s fiery eye,\nBy light we lose light. Your capacity\nIs of that nature that to your huge store\nWise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.\n\nROSALINE.\nThis proves you wise and rich, for in my eye—\n\nBEROWNE.\nI am a fool, and full of poverty.\n\nROSALINE.\nBut that you take what doth to you belong,\nIt were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.\n\nBEROWNE.\nO, I am yours, and all that I possess.\n\nROSALINE.\nAll the fool mine?\n\nBEROWNE.\nI cannot give you less.\n\nROSALINE.\nWhich of the visors was it that you wore?\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhere, when, what visor? Why demand you this?\n\nROSALINE.\nThere, then, that visor; that superfluous case\nThat hid the worse and showed the better face.\n\nKING.\nWe are descried. They’ll mock us now downright.\n\nDUMAINE.\nLet us confess and turn it to a jest.\n\nPRINCESS.\nAmazed, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?\n\nROSALINE.\nHelp! Hold his brows! He’ll swoon. Why look you pale?\nSeasick, I think, coming from Muscovy.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.\nCan any face of brass hold longer out?\nHere stand I, lady; dart thy skill at me.\nBruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,\nThrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,\nCut me to pieces with thy keen conceit,\nAnd I will wish thee never more to dance,\nNor never more in Russian habit wait.\nO, never will I trust to speeches penned,\nNor to the motion of a school-boy’s tongue,\nNor never come in visor to my friend,\nNor woo in rhyme like a blind harper’s song.\nTaffeta phrases, silken terms precise,\nThree-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,\nFigures pedantical: these summer flies\nHave blown me full of maggot ostentation.\nI do forswear them, and I here protest,\nBy this white glove—how white the hand, God knows!—\nHenceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed\nIn russet yeas and honest kersey noes.\nAnd, to begin: wench, so God help me, law,\nMy love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.\n\nROSALINE.\nSans “sans,” I pray you.\n\nBEROWNE.\nYet I have a trick\nOf the old rage. Bear with me, I am sick;\nI’ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:\nWrite “Lord have mercy on us” on those three.\nThey are infected; in their hearts it lies;\nThey have the plague, and caught it of your eyes.\nThese lords are visited. You are not free,\nFor the Lord’s tokens on you do I see.\n\nPRINCESS.\nNo, they are free that gave these tokens to us.\n\nBEROWNE.\nOur states are forfeit. Seek not to undo us.\n\nROSALINE.\nIt is not so. For how can this be true,\nThat you stand forfeit, being those that sue?\n\nBEROWNE.\nPeace! for I will not have to do with you.\n\nROSALINE.\nNor shall not, if I do as I intend.\n\nBEROWNE.\nSpeak for yourselves. My wit is at an end.\n\nKING.\nTeach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression\nSome fair excuse.\n\nPRINCESS.\nThe fairest is confession.\nWere not you here but even now, disguised?\n\nKING.\nMadam, I was.\n\nPRINCESS.\nAnd were you well advised?\n\nKING.\nI was, fair madam.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWhen you then were here,\nWhat did you whisper in your lady’s ear?\n\nKING.\nThat more than all the world I did respect her.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWhen she shall challenge this, you will reject her.\n\nKING.\nUpon mine honour, no.\n\nPRINCESS.\nPeace, peace, forbear!\nYour oath once broke, you force not to forswear.\n\nKING.\nDespise me when I break this oath of mine.\n\nPRINCESS.\nI will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,\nWhat did the Russian whisper in your ear?\n\nROSALINE.\nMadam, he swore that he did hold me dear\nAs precious eyesight, and did value me\nAbove this world; adding thereto, moreover,\nThat he would wed me, or else die my lover.\n\nPRINCESS.\nGod give thee joy of him! The noble lord\nMost honourably doth uphold his word.\n\nKING.\nWhat mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,\nI never swore this lady such an oath.\n\nROSALINE.\nBy heaven, you did! And to confirm it plain,\nYou gave me this. But take it, sir, again.\n\nKING.\nMy faith and this the Princess I did give.\nI knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.\n\nPRINCESS.\nPardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear,\nAnd Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.\nWhat, will you have me, or your pearl again?\n\nBEROWNE.\nNeither of either; I remit both twain.\nI see the trick on’t. Here was a consent,\nKnowing aforehand of our merriment,\nTo dash it like a Christmas comedy.\nSome carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,\nSome mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,\nThat smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick\nTo make my lady laugh when she’s disposed,\nTold our intents before; which once disclosed,\nThe ladies did change favours, and then we,\nFollowing the signs, wooed but the sign of she.\nNow, to our perjury to add more terror,\nWe are again forsworn in will and error.\nMuch upon this ’tis. [To Boyet.] And might not you\nForestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?\nDo not you know my lady’s foot by th’ squier,\nAnd laugh upon the apple of her eye?\nAnd stand between her back, sir, and the fire,\nHolding a trencher, jesting merrily?\nYou put our page out. Go, you are allowed;\nDie when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.\nYou leer upon me, do you? There’s an eye\nWounds like a leaden sword.\n\nBOYET.\nFull merrily\nHath this brave manage, this career, been run.\n\nBEROWNE.\nLo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.\n\nEnter Costard.\n\nWelcome, pure wit! Thou part’st a fair fray.\n\nCOSTARD.\nO Lord, sir, they would know\nWhether the three Worthies shall come in or no.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhat, are there but three?\n\nCOSTARD.\nNo, sir; but it is vara fine,\nFor every one pursents three.\n\nBEROWNE.\nAnd three times thrice is nine.\n\nCOSTARD.\nNot so, sir, under correction, sir, I hope it is not so.\nYou cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we know.\nI hope, sir, three times thrice, sir—\n\nBEROWNE.\nIs not nine?\n\nCOSTARD.\nUnder correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.\n\nBEROWNE.\nBy Jove, I always took three threes for nine.\n\nCOSTARD.\nO Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by reckoning, sir.\n\nBEROWNE.\nHow much is it?\n\nCOSTARD.\nO Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man in one poor man—Pompion the Great, sir.\n\nBEROWNE.\nArt thou one of the Worthies?\n\nCOSTARD.\nIt pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great. For mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.\n\nBEROWNE.\nGo bid them prepare.\n\nCOSTARD.\nWe will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.\n\n[Exit Costard.]\n\nKING.\nBerowne, they will shame us. Let them not approach.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWe are shame-proof, my lord, and ’tis some policy\nTo have one show worse than the King’s and his company.\n\nKING.\nI say they shall not come.\n\nPRINCESS.\nNay, my good lord, let me o’errule you now.\nThat sport best pleases that doth least know how,\nWhere zeal strives to content, and the contents\nDie in the zeal of that which it presents;\nTheir form confounded makes most form in mirth,\nWhen great things labouring perish in their birth.\n\nBEROWNE.\nA right description of our sport, my lord.\n\nEnter Armado, the Braggart.\n\nARMADO.\nAnointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.\n\n[Armado and King talk apart.]\n\nPRINCESS.\nDoth this man serve God?\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhy ask you?\n\nPRINCESS.\nHe speaks not like a man of God his making.\n\nARMADO.\nThat is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical; too, too vain, too, too vain. But we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nKING.\nHere is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado’s page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus.\nAnd if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,\nThese four will change habits and present the other five.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThere is five in the first show.\n\nKING.\nYou are deceived. ’Tis not so.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThe pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and the boy.\nAbate throw at novum, and the whole world again\nCannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.\n\nKING.\nThe ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.\n\nEnter Costard as Pompey.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI Pompey am—\n\nBEROWNE.\nYou lie, you are not he.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI Pompey am—\n\nBOYET.\nWith leopard’s head on knee.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWell said, old mocker. I must needs be friends with thee.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big.\n\nDUMAINE.\nThe “Great”.\n\nCOSTARD.\nIt is “Great”, sir; Pompey surnamed the Great,\nThat oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to sweat.\nAnd travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,\nAnd lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France.\nIf your ladyship would say, “Thanks, Pompey”, I had done.\n\nPRINCESS.\nGreat thanks, great Pompey.\n\nCOSTARD.\n’Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect. I made a little fault in “Great”.\n\nBEROWNE.\nMy hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.\n\nEnter Nathaniel, the Curate, for Alexander.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nWhen in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander;\nBy east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might.\nMy scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander.\n\nBOYET.\nYour nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right.\n\nBEROWNE.\nYour nose smells “no” in this, most tender-smelling knight.\n\nPRINCESS.\nThe conqueror is dismayed. Proceed, good Alexander.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nWhen in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander—\n\nBOYET.\nMost true; ’tis right. You were so, Alisander.\n\nBEROWNE.\nPompey the Great—\n\nCOSTARD.\nYour servant, and Costard.\n\nBEROWNE.\nTake away the conqueror, take away Alisander.\n\nCOSTARD.\n[To Sir Nathaniel.] O sir, you have overthrown Alisander the Conqueror. You will be scraped out of the painted cloth for this. Your lion, that holds his pole-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given to Ajax. He will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror, and afeard to speak? Run away for shame, Alisander. [Nathaniel retires.] There, an’t shall please you, a foolish mild man; an honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good bowler; but for Alisander, alas you see how ’tis—a little o’erparted. But there are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.\n\nPRINCESS.\nStand aside, good Pompey.\n\nEnter Holofernes, the Pedant, as Judas, and Moth, the Boy, as Hercules.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nGreat Hercules is presented by this imp,\nWhose club killed Cerberus, that three-headed canus,\nAnd when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,\nThus did he strangle serpents in his manus.\nQuoniam he seemeth in minority,\nErgo I come with this apology.\nKeep some state in thy exit, and vanish.\n\n[Moth retires.]\n\nJudas I am.—\n\nDUMAINE.\nA Judas!\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nNot Iscariot, sir.\nJudas I am, ycleped Maccabaeus.\n\nDUMAINE.\nJudas Maccabaeus clipped is plain Judas.\n\nBEROWNE.\nA kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nJudas I am—\n\nDUMAINE.\nThe more shame for you, Judas.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nWhat mean you, sir?\n\nBOYET.\nTo make Judas hang himself.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nBegin, sir; you are my elder.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWell followed. Judas was hanged on an elder.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nI will not be put out of countenance.\n\nBEROWNE.\nBecause thou hast no face.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nWhat is this?\n\nBOYET.\nA cittern-head.\n\nDUMAINE.\nThe head of a bodkin.\n\nBEROWNE.\nA death’s face in a ring.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nThe face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.\n\nBOYET.\nThe pommel of Caesar’s falchion.\n\nDUMAINE.\nThe carved-bone face on a flask.\n\nBEROWNE.\nSaint George’s half-cheek in a brooch.\n\nDUMAINE.\nAy, and in a brooch of lead.\n\nBEROWNE.\nAy, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.\nAnd now forward, for we have put thee in countenance.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nYou have put me out of countenance.\n\nBEROWNE.\nFalse. We have given thee faces.\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nBut you have outfaced them all.\n\nBEROWNE.\nAn thou wert a lion, we would do so.\n\nBOYET.\nTherefore, as he is an ass, let him go.\nAnd so adieu, sweet Jude. Nay, why dost thou stay?\n\nDUMAINE.\nFor the latter end of his name.\n\nBEROWNE.\nFor the ass to the Jude? Give it him. Jud-as, away!\n\nHOLOFERNES.\nThis is not generous, not gentle, not humble.\n\nBOYET.\nA light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark; he may stumble.\n\n[Exit Holofernes.]\n\nPRINCESS.\nAlas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!\n\nEnter Armado, the Braggart, as Hector.\n\nBEROWNE.\nHide thy head, Achilles. Here comes Hector in arms.\n\nDUMAINE.\nThough my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.\n\nKING.\nHector was but a Trojan in respect of this.\n\nBOYET.\nBut is this Hector?\n\nDUMAINE.\nI think Hector was not so clean-timbered.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nHis leg is too big for Hector’s.\n\nDUMAINE.\nMore calf, certain.\n\nBOYET.\nNo, he is best endued in the small.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThis cannot be Hector.\n\nDUMAINE.\nHe’s a god or a painter, for he makes faces.\n\nARMADO.\nThe armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,\nGave Hector a gift—\n\nDUMAINE.\nA gilt nutmeg.\n\nBEROWNE.\nA lemon.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nStuck with cloves.\n\nDUMAINE.\nNo, cloven.\n\nARMADO.\nPeace!\nThe armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,\n    Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;\nA man so breathed that certain he would fight, yea,\n    From morn till night, out of his pavilion.\nI am that flower—\n\nDUMAINE.\nThat mint.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nThat columbine.\n\nARMADO.\nSweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nI must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.\n\nDUMAINE.\nAy, and Hector’s a greyhound.\n\nARMADO.\nThe sweet war-man is dead and rotten. Sweet chucks, beat not the bones of the buried. When he breathed, he was a man. But I will forward with my device. [To the Princess.] Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.\n\nPRINCESS.\nSpeak, brave Hector; we are much delighted.\n\nARMADO.\nI do adore thy sweet Grace’s slipper.\n\nBOYET.\nLoves her by the foot.\n\nDUMAINE.\nHe may not by the yard.\n\nARMADO.\nThis Hector far surmounted Hannibal.\nThe party is gone—\n\nCOSTARD.\nFellow Hector, she is gone; she is two months on her way.\n\nARMADO.\nWhat meanest thou?\n\nCOSTARD.\nFaith, unless you play the honest Trojan, the poor wench is cast away. She’s quick; the child brags in her belly already. ’Tis yours.\n\nARMADO.\nDost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.\n\nCOSTARD.\nThen shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is quick by him, and hanged for Pompey that is dead by him.\n\nDUMAINE.\nMost rare Pompey!\n\nBOYET.\nRenowned Pompey!\n\nBEROWNE.\nGreater than “Great”! Great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the Huge!\n\nDUMAINE.\nHector trembles.\n\nBEROWNE.\nPompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on, stir them on!\n\nDUMAINE.\nHector will challenge him.\n\nBEROWNE.\nAy, if he have no more man’s blood in his belly than will sup a flea.\n\nARMADO.\nBy the north pole, I do challenge thee.\n\nCOSTARD.\nI will not fight with a pole, like a northern man. I’ll slash, I’ll do it by the sword. I bepray you, let me borrow my arms again.\n\nDUMAINE.\nRoom for the incensed Worthies!\n\nCOSTARD.\nI’ll do it in my shirt.\n\nDUMAINE.\nMost resolute Pompey!\n\nMOTH.\nMaster, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean you? You will lose your reputation.\n\nARMADO.\nGentlemen and soldiers, pardon me. I will not combat in my shirt.\n\nDUMAINE.\nYou may not deny it. Pompey hath made the challenge.\n\nARMADO.\nSweet bloods, I both may and will.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWhat reason have you for ’t?\n\nARMADO.\nThe naked truth of it is, I have no shirt. I go woolward for penance.\n\nBOYET.\nTrue, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen; since when, I’ll be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of Jaquenetta’s, and that he wears next his heart for a favour.\n\nEnter a Messenger, Monsieur Marcadé.\n\nMARCADÉ.\nGod save you, madam.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWelcome, Marcadé,\nBut that thou interruptest our merriment.\n\nMARCADÉ.\nI am sorry, madam, for the news I bring\nIs heavy in my tongue. The King your father—\n\nPRINCESS.\nDead, for my life!\n\nMARCADÉ.\nEven so. My tale is told.\n\nBEROWNE.\nWorthies away! The scene begins to cloud.\n\nARMADO.\nFor mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.\n\n[Exeunt Worthies.]\n\nKING.\nHow fares your Majesty?\n\nPRINCESS.\nBoyet, prepare. I will away tonight.\n\nKING.\nMadam, not so. I do beseech you stay.\n\nPRINCESS.\nPrepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,\nFor all your fair endeavours, and entreat,\nOut of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe\nIn your rich wisdom to excuse or hide\nThe liberal opposition of our spirits,\nIf over-boldly we have borne ourselves\nIn the converse of breath; your gentleness\nWas guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord!\nA heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.\nExcuse me so, coming too short of thanks\nFor my great suit so easily obtained.\n\nKING.\nThe extreme parts of time extremely forms\nAll causes to the purpose of his speed,\nAnd often at his very loose decides\nThat which long process could not arbitrate.\nAnd though the mourning brow of progeny\nForbid the smiling courtesy of love\nThe holy suit which fain it would convince,\nYet, since love’s argument was first on foot,\nLet not the cloud of sorrow jostle it\nFrom what it purposed; since to wail friends lost\nIs not by much so wholesome-profitable\nAs to rejoice at friends but newly found.\n\nPRINCESS.\nI understand you not. My griefs are double.\n\nBEROWNE.\nHonest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;\nAnd by these badges understand the King.\nFor your fair sakes have we neglected time,\nPlayed foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies,\nHath much deformed us, fashioning our humours\nEven to the opposed end of our intents;\nAnd what in us hath seemed ridiculous—\nAs love is full of unbefitting strains,\nAll wanton as a child, skipping and vain,\nFormed by the eye and therefore, like the eye,\nFull of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,\nVarying in subjects as the eye doth roll\nTo every varied object in his glance;\nWhich parti-coated presence of loose love\nPut on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,\nHave misbecomed our oaths and gravities,\nThose heavenly eyes that look into these faults\nSuggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,\nOur love being yours, the error that love makes\nIs likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false\nBy being once false for ever to be true\nTo those that make us both—fair ladies, you.\nAnd even that falsehood, in itself a sin,\nThus purifies itself and turns to grace.\n\nPRINCESS.\nWe have received your letters, full of love;\nYour favours, the ambassadors of love;\nAnd in our maiden council rated them\nAt courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,\nAs bombast and as lining to the time.\nBut more devout than this in our respects\nHave we not been; and therefore met your loves\nIn their own fashion, like a merriment.\n\nDUMAINE.\nOur letters, madam, showed much more than jest.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nSo did our looks.\n\nROSALINE.\nWe did not quote them so.\n\nKING.\nNow, at the latest minute of the hour,\nGrant us your loves.\n\nPRINCESS.\nA time, methinks, too short\nTo make a world-without-end bargain in.\nNo, no, my lord, your Grace is perjured much,\nFull of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:\nIf for my love—as there is no such cause—\nYou will do aught, this shall you do for me:\nYour oath I will not trust, but go with speed\nTo some forlorn and naked hermitage,\nRemote from all the pleasures of the world,\nThere stay until the twelve celestial signs\nHave brought about the annual reckoning.\nIf this austere insociable life\nChange not your offer made in heat of blood;\nIf frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,\nNip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,\nBut that it bear this trial, and last love;\nThen, at the expiration of the year,\nCome challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,\nAnd, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,\nI will be thine. And, till that instance, shut\nMy woeful self up in a mournful house,\nRaining the tears of lamentation\nFor the remembrance of my father’s death.\nIf this thou do deny, let our hands part,\nNeither entitled in the other’s heart.\n\nKING.\nIf this, or more than this, I would deny,\n    To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,\nThe sudden hand of death close up mine eye!\n    Hence hermit, then. My heart is in thy breast.\n\n[They converse apart]\n\nDUMAINE.\nAnd what to me, my love? But what to me?\nA wife?\n\nKATHARINE.\nA beard, fair health, and honesty;\nWith threefold love I wish you all these three.\n\nDUMAINE.\nO, shall I say, “I thank you, gentle wife”?\n\nKATHARINE.\nNo so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day\nI’ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say.\nCome when the King doth to my lady come;\nThen, if I have much love, I’ll give you some.\n\nDUMAINE.\nI’ll serve thee true and faithfully till then.\n\nKATHARINE.\nYet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.\n\n[They converse apart]\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nWhat says Maria?\n\nMARIA.\nAt the twelvemonth’s end\nI’ll change my black gown for a faithful friend.\n\nLONGAVILLE.\nI’ll stay with patience, but the time is long.\n\nMARIA.\nThe liker you; few taller are so young.\n\n[They converse apart]\n\nBEROWNE.\nStudies my lady? Mistress, look on me.\nBehold the window of my heart, mine eye,\nWhat humble suit attends thy answer there.\nImpose some service on me for thy love.\n\nROSALINE.\nOft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,\nBefore I saw you; and the world’s large tongue\nProclaims you for a man replete with mocks,\nFull of comparisons and wounding flouts,\nWhich you on all estates will execute\nThat lie within the mercy of your wit.\nTo weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,\nAnd therewithal to win me, if you please,\nWithout the which I am not to be won,\nYou shall this twelvemonth term from day to day\nVisit the speechless sick, and still converse\nWith groaning wretches; and your task shall be,\nWith all the fierce endeavour of your wit\nTo enforce the pained impotent to smile.\n\nBEROWNE.\nTo move wild laughter in the throat of death?\nIt cannot be, it is impossible.\nMirth cannot move a soul in agony.\n\nROSALINE.\nWhy, that’s the way to choke a gibing spirit,\nWhose influence is begot of that loose grace\nWhich shallow laughing hearers give to fools.\nA jest’s prosperity lies in the ear\nOf him that hears it, never in the tongue\nOf him that makes it. Then, if sickly ears,\nDeafed with the clamours of their own dear groans,\nWill hear your idle scorns, continue then,\nAnd I will have you and that fault withal;\nBut if they will not, throw away that spirit,\nAnd I shall find you empty of that fault,\nRight joyful of your reformation.\n\nBEROWNE.\nA twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,\nI’ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.\n\nPRINCESS.\n[To the King.] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.\n\nKING.\nNo, madam, we will bring you on your way.\n\nBEROWNE.\nOur wooing doth not end like an old play.\nJack hath not Jill. These ladies’ courtesy\nMight well have made our sport a comedy.\n\nKING.\nCome, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,\nAnd then ’twill end.\n\nBEROWNE.\nThat’s too long for a play.\n\nEnter Armado, the Braggart.\n\nARMADO.\nSweet Majesty, vouchsafe me—\n\nPRINCESS.\nWas not that Hector?\n\nDUMAINE.\nThe worthy knight of Troy.\n\nARMADO.\nI will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three year. But, most esteemed Greatness, will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the end of our show.\n\nKING.\nCall them forth quickly; we will do so.\n\nARMADO.\nHolla! Approach.\n\nEnter all.\n\nThis side is Hiems, Winter; this Ver, the Spring; the one maintained by the owl, th’ other by the cuckoo. Ver, begin.\n\nThe Song\nSPRING.\nWhen daisies pied and violets blue\n    And lady-smocks all silver-white\nAnd cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\n    Do paint the meadows with delight,\nThe cuckoo then on every tree\nMocks married men; for thus sings he:\n         “Cuckoo!\nCuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear,\nUnpleasing to a married ear.\n\nWhen shepherds pipe on oaten straws,\n    And merry larks are ploughmen’s clocks,\nWhen turtles tread, and rooks and daws,\n    And maidens bleach their summer smocks,\nThe cuckoo then, on every tree,\nMocks married men, for thus sings he:\n         “Cuckoo!\nCuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear,\nUnpleasing to a married ear.\n\nWINTER.\nWhen icicles hang by the wall,\n    And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,\nAnd Tom bears logs into the hall,\n    And milk comes frozen home in pail,\nWhen blood is nipped, and ways be foul,\n  Then nightly sings the staring owl:\n“Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!” A merry note,\nWhile greasy Joan doth keel the pot.\n\nWhen all aloud the wind doth blow,\n    And coughing drowns the parson’s saw,\nAnd birds sit brooding in the snow,\n    And Marian’s nose looks red and raw,\nWhen roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,\nThen nightly sings the staring owl:\n“Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!” A merry note,\nWhile greasy Joan doth keel the pot.\n\nARMADO.\nThe words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo.\nYou that way, we this way.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
