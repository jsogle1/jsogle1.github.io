when your words are done,\nMy woes end likewise with the evening sun.\n\nDUKE.\nWell, Syracusian, say in brief the cause\nWhy thou departedst from thy native home,\nAnd for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.\n\nEGEON.\nA heavier task could not have been impos’d\nThan I to speak my griefs unspeakable;\nYet, that the world may witness that my end\nWas wrought by nature, not by vile offence,\nI’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.\nIn Syracusa was I born, and wed\nUnto a woman happy but for me,\nAnd by me, had not our hap been bad.\nWith her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d\nBy prosperous voyages I often made\nTo Epidamnum, till my factor’s death,\nAnd the great care of goods at random left,\nDrew me from kind embracements of my spouse;\nFrom whom my absence was not six months old\nBefore herself (almost at fainting under\nThe pleasing punishment that women bear)\nHad made provision for her following me,\nAnd soon and safe arrived where I was.\nThere had she not been long but she became\nA joyful mother of two goodly sons,\nAnd, which was strange, the one so like the other\nAs could not be distinguish’d but by names.\nThat very hour, and in the self-same inn,\nA mean woman was delivered\nOf such a burden, male twins, both alike.\nThose, for their parents were exceeding poor,\nI bought, and brought up to attend my sons.\nMy wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,\nMade daily motions for our home return.\nUnwilling I agreed; alas, too soon\nWe came aboard.\nA league from Epidamnum had we sail’d\nBefore the always-wind-obeying deep\nGave any tragic instance of our harm;\nBut longer did we not retain much hope;\nFor what obscured light the heavens did grant\nDid but convey unto our fearful minds\nA doubtful warrant of immediate death,\nWhich though myself would gladly have embrac’d,\nYet the incessant weepings of my wife,\nWeeping before for what she saw must come,\nAnd piteous plainings of the pretty babes,\nThat mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,\nForc’d me to seek delays for them and me.\nAnd this it was (for other means was none).\nThe sailors sought for safety by our boat,\nAnd left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.\nMy wife, more careful for the latter-born,\nHad fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,\nSuch as sea-faring men provide for storms.\nTo him one of the other twins was bound,\nWhilst I had been like heedful of the other.\nThe children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,\nFixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,\nFast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,\nAnd, floating straight, obedient to the stream,\nWas carried towards Corinth, as we thought.\nAt length the sun, gazing upon the earth,\nDispers’d those vapours that offended us,\nAnd by the benefit of his wished light\nThe seas wax’d calm, and we discovered\nTwo ships from far, making amain to us,\nOf Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.\nBut ere they came—O, let me say no more!\nGather the sequel by that went before.\n\nDUKE.\nNay, forward, old man, do not break off so,\nFor we may pity, though not pardon thee.\n\nEGEON.\nO, had the gods done so, I had not now\nWorthily term’d them merciless to us.\nFor, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,\nWe were encountered by a mighty rock,\nWhich being violently borne upon,\nOur helpful ship was splitted in the midst;\nSo that, in this unjust divorce of us,\nFortune had left to both of us alike\nWhat to delight in, what to sorrow for.\nHer part, poor soul, seeming as burdened\nWith lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,\nWas carried with more speed before the wind,\nAnd in our sight they three were taken up\nBy fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.\nAt length another ship had seiz’d on us;\nAnd, knowing whom it was their hap to save,\nGave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack’d guests,\nAnd would have reft the fishers of their prey,\nHad not their bark been very slow of sail;\nAnd therefore homeward did they bend their course.\nThus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,\nThat by misfortunes was my life prolong’d\nTo tell sad stories of my own mishaps.\n\nDUKE.\nAnd for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,\nDo me the favour to dilate at full\nWhat have befall’n of them and thee till now.\n\nEGEON.\nMy youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,\nAt eighteen years became inquisitive\nAfter his brother, and importun’d me\nThat his attendant, so his case was like,\nReft of his brother, but retain’d his name,\nMight bear him company in the quest of him;\nWhom whilst I laboured of a love to see,\nI hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.\nFive summers have I spent in farthest Greece,\nRoaming clean through the bounds of Asia,\nAnd, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,\nHopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought\nOr that or any place that harbours men.\nBut here must end the story of my life;\nAnd happy were I in my timely death,\nCould all my travels warrant me they live.\n\nDUKE.\nHapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d\nTo bear the extremity of dire mishap;\nNow, trust me, were it not against our laws,\nAgainst my crown, my oath, my dignity,\nWhich princes, would they, may not disannul,\nMy soul should sue as advocate for thee.\nBut though thou art adjudged to the death,\nAnd passed sentence may not be recall’d\nBut to our honour’s great disparagement,\nYet will I favour thee in what I can.\nTherefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day\nTo seek thy health by beneficial help.\nTry all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;\nBeg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,\nAnd live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.\nJailer, take him to thy custody.\n\nJAILER.\nI will, my lord.\n\nEGEON.\nHopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,\nBut to procrastinate his lifeless end.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nFor what reason?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nFor two, and sound ones too.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nNay, not sound, I pray you.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nSure ones, then.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nNay, not sure, in a thing falsing.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nCertain ones, then.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nName them.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nThe one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nYou would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nMarry, and did, sir; namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nBut your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nThus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world’s end will have bald followers.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nI knew ’twould be a bald conclusion.\nBut soft! who wafts us yonder?\n\nEnter Adriana and Luciana.\n\nADRIANA.\nAy, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown,\nSome other mistress hath thy sweet aspects.\nI am not Adriana, nor thy wife.\nThe time was once when thou unurg’d wouldst vow\nThat never words were music to thine ear,\nThat never object pleasing in thine eye,\nThat never touch well welcome to thy hand,\nThat never meat sweet-savour’d in thy taste,\nUnless I spake, or look’d, or touch’d, or carv’d to thee.\nHow comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,\nThat thou art then estranged from thyself?\nThyself I call it, being strange to me,\nThat, undividable, incorporate,\nAm better than thy dear self’s better part.\nAh, do not tear away thyself from me;\nFor know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall\nA drop of water in the breaking gulf,\nAnd take unmingled thence that drop again\nWithout addition or diminishing,\nAs take from me thyself, and not me too.\nHow dearly would it touch thee to the quick,\nShould’st thou but hear I were licentious?\nAnd that this body, consecrate to thee,\nBy ruffian lust should be contaminate?\nWouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,\nAnd hurl the name of husband in my face,\nAnd tear the stain’d skin off my harlot brow,\nAnd from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,\nAnd break it with a deep-divorcing vow?\nI know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.\nI am possess’d with an adulterate blot;\nMy blood is mingled with the crime of lust;\nFor if we two be one, and thou play false,\nI do digest the poison of thy flesh,\nBeing strumpeted by thy contagion.\nKeep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,\nI live distain’d, thou undishonoured.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nPlead you to me, fair dame? I know you not.\nIn Ephesus I am but two hours old,\nAs strange unto your town as to your talk,\nWho, every word by all my wit being scann’d,\nWants wit in all one word to understand.\n\nLUCIANA.\nFie, brother, how the world is chang’d with you.\nWhen were you wont to use my sister thus?\nShe sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nBy Dromio?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nBy me?\n\nADRIANA.\nBy thee; and this thou didst return from him,\nThat he did buffet thee, and in his blows\nDenied my house for his, me for his wife.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nDid you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?\nWhat is the course and drift of your compact?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nI, sir?

If she lives till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nWhat complexion is she of?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nSwart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept.

But I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nWhere Spain?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nFaith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nWhere America, the Indies?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nO, sir, upon her nose, all o’er-embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of carracks to be ballast at her nose.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nWhere stood Belgia, the Netherlands?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nO, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me, called me Dromio, swore I was assured to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch.

I bespoke it not.\n\nANGELO.\nNot once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.\nGo home with it, and please your wife withal,\nAnd soon at supper-time I’ll visit you,\nAnd then receive my money for the chain.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nI pray you, sir, receive the money now,\nFor fear you ne’er see chain nor money more.\n\nANGELO.\nYou are a merry man, sir; fare you well.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nWhat I should think of this I cannot tell,\nBut this I think, there’s no man is so vain\nThat would refuse so fair an offer’d chain.\nI see a man here needs not live by shifts,\nWhen in the streets he meets such golden gifts.\nI’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;\nIf any ship put out, then straight away.\n\n[Exit.]",

Be mad, good master; cry, “the devil”.\n\nLUCIANA.\nGod help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!\n\nADRIANA.\nGo bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.\n\n[Exeunt Pinch and Assistants, with Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio of Ephesus.]\n\nSay now, whose suit is he arrested at?\n\nOFFICER.\nOne Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?\n\nADRIANA.\nI know the man. What is the sum he owes?\n\nOFFICER.\nTwo hundred ducats.\n\nADRIANA.\nSay, how grows it due?\n\nOFFICER.\nDue for a chain your husband had of him.\n\nADRIANA.\nHe did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.\n\nCOURTESAN.\nWhen as your husband, all in rage, today\nCame to my house and took away my ring,\nThe ring I saw upon his finger now,\nStraight after did I meet him with a chain.\n\nADRIANA.\nIt may be so, but I did never see it.\nCome, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is,\nI long to know the truth hereof at large.\n\nEnter Antipholus of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and Dromio of Syracuse.\n\nLUCIANA.\nGod, for thy mercy, they are loose again!\n\nADRIANA.\nAnd come with naked swords.

Methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nI will not stay tonight for all the town;\nTherefore away, to get our stuff aboard.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT V\nSCENE I. The same\nEnter Merchant and Angelo.\n\nANGELO.\nI am sorry, sir, that I have hinder’d you,\nBut I protest he had the chain of me,\nThough most dishonestly he doth deny it.\n\nMERCHANT.\nHow is the man esteem’d here in the city?\n\nANGELO.\nOf very reverend reputation, sir,\nOf credit infinite, highly belov’d,\nSecond to none that lives here in the city.\nHis word might bear my wealth at any time.\n\nMERCHANT.\nSpeak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks.\n\nEnter Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.\n\nANGELO.\n’Tis so; and that self chain about his neck\nWhich he forswore most monstrously to have.\nGood sir, draw near to me, I’ll speak to him.\nSignior Antipholus, I wonder much\nThat you would put me to this shame and trouble,\nAnd not without some scandal to yourself,\nWith circumstance and oaths so to deny\nThis chain, which now you wear so openly.\nBeside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,\nYou have done wrong to this my honest friend,\nWho, but for staying on our controversy,\nHad hoisted sail and put to sea today.\nThis chain you had of me, can you deny it?\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nI think I had: I never did deny it.\n\nMERCHANT.\nYes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nWho heard me to deny it or forswear it?\n\nMERCHANT.\nThese ears of mine, thou know’st, did hear thee.\nFie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st\nTo walk where any honest men resort.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nThou art a villain to impeach me thus;\nI’ll prove mine honour and mine honesty\nAgainst thee presently, if thou dar’st stand.\n\nMERCHANT.\nI dare, and do defy thee for a villain.\n\n[They draw.]\n\nEnter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan and others.\n\nADRIANA.\nHold, hurt him not, for God’s sake, he is mad.\nSome get within him, take his sword away.\nBind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nRun, master, run, for God’s sake, take a house.\nThis is some priory; in, or we are spoil’d.\n\n[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the priory.]\n\nEnter Lady Abbess.\n\nABBESS.\nBe quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?\n\nADRIANA.\nTo fetch my poor distracted husband hence.\nLet us come in, that we may bind him fast\nAnd bear him home for his recovery.\n\nANGELO.\nI knew he was not in his perfect wits.\n\nMERCHANT.\nI am sorry now that I did draw on him.\n\nABBESS.\nHow long hath this possession held the man?\n\nADRIANA.\nThis week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,\nAnd much different from the man he was.\nBut till this afternoon his passion\nNe’er brake into extremity of rage.\n\nABBESS.\nHath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?\nBuried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye\nStray’d his affection in unlawful love?\nA sin prevailing much in youthful men\nWho give their eyes the liberty of gazing?\nWhich of these sorrows is he subject to?\n\nADRIANA.\nTo none of these, except it be the last,\nNamely, some love that drew him oft from home.\n\nABBESS.\nYou should for that have reprehended him.\n\nADRIANA.\nWhy, so I did.\n\nABBESS.\nAy, but not rough enough.\n\nADRIANA.\nAs roughly as my modesty would let me.\n\nABBESS.\nHaply in private.\n\nADRIANA.\nAnd in assemblies too.\n\nABBESS.\nAy, but not enough.\n\nADRIANA.\nIt was the copy of our conference.\nIn bed he slept not for my urging it;\nAt board he fed not for my urging it;\nAlone, it was the subject of my theme;\nIn company I often glanced it;\nStill did I tell him it was vile and bad.\n\nABBESS.\nAnd thereof came it that the man was mad.\nThe venom clamours of a jealous woman\nPoisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.\nIt seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing,\nAnd thereof comes it that his head is light.\nThou say’st his meat was sauc’d with thy upbraidings.\nUnquiet meals make ill digestions;\nThereof the raging fire of fever bred,\nAnd what’s a fever but a fit of madness?\nThou say’st his sports were hinder’d by thy brawls.\nSweet recreation barr’d, what doth ensue\nBut moody and dull melancholy,\nKinsman to grim and comfortless despair,\nAnd at her heels a huge infectious troop\nOf pale distemperatures and foes to life?\nIn food, in sport, and life-preserving rest\nTo be disturb’d would mad or man or beast.\nThe consequence is, then, thy jealous fits\nHath scar’d thy husband from the use of’s wits.\n\nLUCIANA.\nShe never reprehended him but mildly,\nWhen he demean’d himself rough, rude, and wildly.\nWhy bear you these rebukes and answer not?\n\nADRIANA.\nShe did betray me to my own reproof.\nGood people, enter and lay hold on him.\n\nABBESS.\nNo, not a creature enters in my house.\n\nADRIANA.\nThen let your servants bring my husband forth.\n\nABBESS.\nNeither. He took this place for sanctuary,\nAnd it shall privilege him from your hands\nTill I have brought him to his wits again,\nOr lose my labour in assaying it.\n\nADRIANA.\nI will attend my husband, be his nurse,\nDiet his sickness, for it is my office,\nAnd will have no attorney but myself;\nAnd therefore let me have him home with me.\n\nABBESS.\nBe patient, for I will not let him stir\nTill I have used the approved means I have,\nWith wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,\nTo make of him a formal man again.\nIt is a branch and parcel of mine oath,\nA charitable duty of my order;\nTherefore depart, and leave him here with me.\n\nADRIANA.\nI will not hence and leave my husband here;\nAnd ill it doth beseem your holiness\nTo separate the husband and the wife.\n\nABBESS.\nBe quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him.\n\n[Exit Abbess.]\n\nLUCIANA.\nComplain unto the duke of this indignity.\n\nADRIANA.\nCome, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet,\nAnd never rise until my tears and prayers\nHave won his grace to come in person hither\nAnd take perforce my husband from the abbess.\n\nMERCHANT.\nBy this, I think, the dial points at five.\nAnon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person\nComes this way to the melancholy vale,\nThe place of death and sorry execution\nBehind the ditches of the abbey here.\n\nANGELO.\nUpon what cause?\n\nMERCHANT.\nTo see a reverend Syracusian merchant,\nWho put unluckily into this bay\nAgainst the laws and statutes of this town,\nBeheaded publicly for his offence.\n\nANGELO.\nSee where they come. We will behold his death.\n\nLUCIANA.\nKneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.\n\nEnter the Duke, attended; Egeon, bareheaded; with the Headsman and other Officers.\n\nDUKE.\nYet once again proclaim it publicly,\nIf any friend will pay the sum for him,\nHe shall not die; so much we tender him.\n\nADRIANA.\nJustice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!\n\nDUKE.\nShe is a virtuous and a reverend lady,\nIt cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.\n\nADRIANA.\nMay it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,\nWho I made lord of me and all I had\nAt your important letters, this ill day\nA most outrageous fit of madness took him;\nThat desp’rately he hurried through the street,\nWith him his bondman all as mad as he,\nDoing displeasure to the citizens\nBy rushing in their houses, bearing thence\nRings, jewels, anything his rage did like.\nOnce did I get him bound and sent him home,\nWhilst to take order for the wrongs I went,\nThat here and there his fury had committed.\nAnon, I wot not by what strong escape,\nHe broke from those that had the guard of him,\nAnd with his mad attendant and himself,\nEach one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,\nMet us again, and, madly bent on us,\nChased us away; till raising of more aid,\nWe came again to bind them. Then they fled\nInto this abbey, whither we pursued them.\nAnd here the abbess shuts the gates on us,\nAnd will not suffer us to fetch him out,\nNor send him forth that we may bear him hence.\nTherefore, most gracious duke, with thy command\nLet him be brought forth and borne hence for help.\n\nDUKE.\nLong since thy husband serv’d me in my wars,\nAnd I to thee engag’d a prince’s word,\nWhen thou didst make him master of thy bed,\nTo do him all the grace and good I could.\nGo, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,\nAnd bid the lady abbess come to me.\nI will determine this before I stir.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nO mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself.\nMy master and his man are both broke loose,\nBeaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,\nWhose beard they have singed off with brands of fire,\nAnd ever as it blazed they threw on him\nGreat pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.\nMy master preaches patience to him, and the while\nHis man with scissors nicks him like a fool;\nAnd sure (unless you send some present help)\nBetween them they will kill the conjurer.\n\nADRIANA.\nPeace, fool, thy master and his man are here,\nAnd that is false thou dost report to us.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMistress, upon my life, I tell you true.\nI have not breath’d almost since I did see it.\nHe cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,\nTo scorch your face and to disfigure you.\n\n[Cry within.]\n\nHark, hark, I hear him, mistress. Fly, be gone!\n\nDUKE.\nCome, stand by me, fear nothing. Guard with halberds.\n\nADRIANA.\nAy me, it is my husband. Witness you\nThat he is borne about invisible.\nEven now we hous’d him in the abbey here,\nAnd now he’s there, past thought of human reason.\n\nEnter Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nJustice, most gracious duke; O, grant me justice!\nEven for the service that long since I did thee\nWhen I bestrid thee in the wars, and took\nDeep scars to save thy life; even for the blood\nThat then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.\n\nEGEON.\nUnless the fear of death doth make me dote,\nI see my son Antipholus and Dromio.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nJustice, sweet prince, against that woman there.\nShe whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife;\nThat hath abused and dishonour’d me\nEven in the strength and height of injury.\nBeyond imagination is the wrong\nThat she this day hath shameless thrown on me.\n\nDUKE.\nDiscover how, and thou shalt find me just.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nThis day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me\nWhile she with harlots feasted in my house.\n\nDUKE.\nA grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?\n\nADRIANA.\nNo, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister\nToday did dine together. So befall my soul\nAs this is false he burdens me withal.\n\nLUCIANA.\nNe’er may I look on day nor sleep on night\nBut she tells to your highness simple truth.\n\nANGELO.\nO perjur’d woman! They are both forsworn.\nIn this the madman justly chargeth them.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nMy liege, I am advised what I say,\nNeither disturb’d with the effect of wine,\nNor heady-rash, provok’d with raging ire,\nAlbeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.\nThis woman lock’d me out this day from dinner.\nThat goldsmith there, were he not pack’d with her,\nCould witness it, for he was with me then,\nWho parted with me to go fetch a chain,\nPromising to bring it to the Porpentine,\nWhere Balthasar and I did dine together.\nOur dinner done, and he not coming thither,\nI went to seek him. In the street I met him,\nAnd in his company that gentleman.\nThere did this perjur’d goldsmith swear me down\nThat I this day of him receiv’d the chain,\nWhich, God he knows, I saw not. For the which\nHe did arrest me with an officer.\nI did obey, and sent my peasant home\nFor certain ducats. He with none return’d.\nThen fairly I bespoke the officer\nTo go in person with me to my house.\nBy th’ way we met\nMy wife, her sister, and a rabble more\nOf vile confederates. Along with them\nThey brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,\nA mere anatomy, a mountebank,\nA threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller;\nA needy, hollow-ey’d, sharp-looking wretch;\nA living dead man. This pernicious slave,\nForsooth, took on him as a conjurer,\nAnd gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,\nAnd with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me,\nCries out, I was possess’d. Then altogether\nThey fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,\nAnd in a dark and dankish vault at home\nThere left me and my man, both bound together,\nTill gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,\nI gain’d my freedom and immediately\nRan hither to your Grace, whom I beseech\nTo give me ample satisfaction\nFor these deep shames and great indignities.\n\nANGELO.\nMy lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,\nThat he din’d not at home, but was lock’d out.\n\nDUKE.\nBut had he such a chain of thee, or no?\n\nANGELO.\nHe had, my lord, and when he ran in here\nThese people saw the chain about his neck.\n\nMERCHANT.\nBesides, I will be sworn these ears of mine\nHeard you confess you had the chain of him,\nAfter you first forswore it on the mart,\nAnd thereupon I drew my sword on you;\nAnd then you fled into this abbey here,\nFrom whence I think you are come by miracle.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nI never came within these abbey walls,\nNor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me.\nI never saw the chain, so help me heaven;\nAnd this is false you burden me withal.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy, what an intricate impeach is this!\nI think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.\nIf here you hous’d him, here he would have been.\nIf he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.\nYou say he din’d at home, the goldsmith here\nDenies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nSir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.\n\nCOURTESAN.\nHe did, and from my finger snatch’d that ring.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\n’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.\n\nDUKE.\nSaw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?\n\nCOURTESAN.\nAs sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.\nI think you are all mated, or stark mad.\n\n[Exit one to the Abbess.]\n\nEGEON.\nMost mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word;\nHaply I see a friend will save my life\nAnd pay the sum that may deliver me.\n\nDUKE.\nSpeak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.\n\nEGEON.\nIs not your name, sir, call’d Antipholus?\nAnd is not that your bondman Dromio?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nWithin this hour I was his bondman, sir,\nBut he, I thank him, gnaw’d in two my cords.\nNow am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.\n\nEGEON.\nI am sure you both of you remember me.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nOurselves we do remember, sir, by you.\nFor lately we were bound as you are now.\nYou are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?\n\nEGEON.\nWhy look you strange on me? you know me well.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nI never saw you in my life till now.\n\nEGEON.\nO! grief hath chang’d me since you saw me last,\nAnd careful hours with time’s deformed hand,\nHave written strange defeatures in my face.\nBut tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nNeither.\n\nEGEON.\nDromio, nor thou?\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nNo, trust me, sir, nor I.\n\nEGEON.\nI am sure thou dost.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nAy, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.\n\nEGEON.\nNot know my voice! O time’s extremity,\nHast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue\nIn seven short years that here my only son\nKnows not my feeble key of untun’d cares?\nThough now this grained face of mine be hid\nIn sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow,\nAnd all the conduits of my blood froze up,\nYet hath my night of life some memory,\nMy wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,\nMy dull deaf ears a little use to hear.\nAll these old witnesses, I cannot err,\nTell me thou art my son Antipholus.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nI never saw my father in my life.\n\nEGEON.\nBut seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,\nThou know’st we parted; but perhaps, my son,\nThou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nThe duke and all that know me in the city,\nCan witness with me that it is not so.\nI ne’er saw Syracusa in my life.\n\nDUKE.\nI tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years\nHave I been patron to Antipholus,\nDuring which time he ne’er saw Syracusa.\nI see thy age and dangers make thee dote.\n\nEnter the Abbess with Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.\n\nABBESS.\nMost mighty duke, behold a man much wrong’d.\n\n[All gather to see them.]\n\nADRIANA.\nI see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.\n\nDUKE.\nOne of these men is genius to the other;\nAnd so of these, which is the natural man,\nAnd which the spirit? Who deciphers them?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nI, sir, am Dromio, command him away.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nI, sir, am Dromio, pray let me stay.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nEgeon, art thou not? or else his ghost?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nO, my old master, who hath bound him here?\n\nABBESS.\nWhoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,\nAnd gain a husband by his liberty.\nSpeak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man\nThat hadst a wife once called Emilia,\nThat bore thee at a burden two fair sons.\nO, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,\nAnd speak unto the same Emilia!\n\nDUKE.\nWhy, here begins his morning story right:\nThese two Antipholus’, these two so like,\nAnd these two Dromios, one in semblance,\nBesides her urging of her wreck at sea.\nThese are the parents to these children,\nWhich accidentally are met together.\nEGEON.\nIf I dream not, thou art Emilia.\nIf thou art she, tell me where is that son\nThat floated with thee on the fatal raft?\n\nABBESS.\nBy men of Epidamnum, he and I\nAnd the twin Dromio, all were taken up;\nBut, by and by, rude fishermen of Corinth\nBy force took Dromio and my son from them,\nAnd me they left with those of Epidamnum.\nWhat then became of them I cannot tell;\nI to this fortune that you see me in.\n\nDUKE.\nAntipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first?\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nNo, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse.\n\nDUKE.\nStay, stand apart, I know not which is which.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nI came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nAnd I with him.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nBrought to this town by that most famous warrior,\nDuke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.\n\nADRIANA.\nWhich of you two did dine with me today?\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nI, gentle mistress.\n\nADRIANA.\nAnd are not you my husband?\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nNo, I say nay to that.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nAnd so do I, yet did she call me so;\nAnd this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,\nDid call me brother. What I told you then,\nI hope I shall have leisure to make good,\nIf this be not a dream I see and hear.\n\nANGELO.\nThat is the chain, sir, which you had of me.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nI think it be, sir. I deny it not.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nAnd you, sir, for this chain arrested me.\n\nANGELO.\nI think I did, sir. I deny it not.\n\nADRIANA.\nI sent you money, sir, to be your bail\nBy Dromio, but I think he brought it not.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nNo, none by me.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nThis purse of ducats I receiv’d from you,\nAnd Dromio my man did bring them me.\nI see we still did meet each other’s man,\nAnd I was ta’en for him, and he for me,\nAnd thereupon these errors are arose.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nThese ducats pawn I for my father here.\n\nDUKE.\nIt shall not need, thy father hath his life.\n\nCOURTESAN.\nSir, I must have that diamond from you.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nThere, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.\n\nABBESS.\nRenowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains\nTo go with us into the abbey here,\nAnd hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;\nAnd all that are assembled in this place,\nThat by this sympathised one day’s error\nHave suffer’d wrong, go, keep us company,\nAnd we shall make full satisfaction.\nThirty-three years have I but gone in travail\nOf you, my sons, and till this present hour\nMy heavy burden ne’er delivered.\nThe duke, my husband, and my children both,\nAnd you, the calendars of their nativity,\nGo to a gossips’ feast, and go with me.\nAfter so long grief, such nativity.\n\nDUKE.\nWith all my heart, I’ll gossip at this feast.\n\n[Exeunt except the two Dromios and two Brothers.]\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nMaster, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.\nDromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark’d?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nYour goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.\nHe speaks to me; I am your master, Dromio.\nCome, go with us. We’ll look to that anon.\nEmbrace thy brother there, rejoice with him.\n\n[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus.]\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nThere is a fat friend at your master’s house,\nThat kitchen’d me for you today at dinner.\nShe now shall be my sister, not my wife.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nMethinks you are my glass, and not my brother.\nI see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.\nWill you walk in to see their gossiping?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nNot I, sir, you are my elder.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nThat’s a question, how shall we try it?\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\nWe’ll draw cuts for the senior. Till then, lead thou first.\n\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS.\nNay, then, thus:\nWe came into the world like brother and brother,\nAnd now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
