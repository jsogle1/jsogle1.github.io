KING RICHARD II's palace.\nEnter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants\nKING RICHARD II\nOld John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,\nHast thou, according to thy oath and band,\nBrought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,\nHere to make good the boisterous late appeal,\nWhich then our leisure would not let us hear,\nAgainst the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nI have, my liege.\nKING RICHARD II\nTell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,\nIf he appeal the duke on ancient malice;\nOr worthily, as a good subject should,\nOn some known ground of treachery in him?\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nAs near as I could sift him on that argument,\nOn some apparent danger seen in him\nAim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.\nKING RICHARD II\nThen call them to our presence; face to face,\nAnd frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear\nThe accuser and the accused freely speak:\nHigh-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,\nIn rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.\nEnter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nMany years of happy days befal\nMy gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY\nEach day still better other's happiness;\nUntil the heavens, envying earth's good hap,\nAdd an immortal title to your crown!\nKING RICHARD II\nWe thank you both: yet one but flatters us,\nAs well appeareth by the cause you come;\nNamely to appeal each other of high treason.\nCousin of Hereford, what dost thou object\nAgainst the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nFirst, heaven be the record to my speech!\nIn the devotion of a subject's love,\nTendering the precious safety of my prince,\nAnd free from other misbegotten hate,\nCome I appellant to this princely presence.\nNow, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,\nAnd mark my greeting well; for what I speak\nMy body shall make good upon this earth,\nOr my divine soul answer it in heaven.\nThou art a traitor and a miscreant,\nToo good to be so and too bad to live,\nSince the more fair and crystal is the sky,\nThe uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.\nOnce more, the more to aggravate the note,\nWith a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;\nAnd wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,\nWhat my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY\nLet not my cold words here accuse my zeal:\n'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,\nThe bitter clamour of two eager tongues,\nCan arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;\nThe blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:\nYet can I not of such tame patience boast\nAs to be hush'd and nought at all to say:\nFirst, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me\nFrom giving reins and spurs to my free speech;\nWhich else would post until it had return'd\nThese terms of treason doubled down his throat.\nSetting aside his high blood's royalty,\nAnd let him be no kinsman to my liege,\nI do defy him, and I spit at him;\nCall him a slanderous coward and a villain:\nWhich to maintain I would allow him odds,\nAnd meet him, were I tied to run afoot\nEven to the frozen ridges of the Alps,\nOr any other ground inhabitable,\nWhere ever Englishman durst set his foot.\nMean time let this defend my loyalty,\nBy all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nPale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,\nDisclaiming here the kindred of the king,\nAnd lay aside my high blood's royalty,\nWhich fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.\nIf guilty dread have left thee so much strength\nAs to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:\nBy that and all the rites of knighthood else,\nWill I make good against thee, arm to arm,\nWhat I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY\nI take it up; and by that sword I swear\nWhich gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,\nI'll answer thee in any fair degree,\nOr chivalrous design of knightly trial:\nAnd when I mount, alive may I not light,\nIf I be traitor or unjustly fight!\nKING RICHARD II\nWhat doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?\nIt must be great that can inherit us\nSo much as of a thought of ill in him.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nLook, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;\nThat Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles\nIn name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,\nThe which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,\nLike a false traitor and injurious villain.\nBesides I say and will in battle prove,\nOr here or elsewhere to the furthest verge\nThat ever was survey'd by English eye,\nThat all the treasons for these eighteen years\nComplotted and contrived in this land\nFetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.\nFurther I say and further will maintain\nUpon his bad life to make all this good,\nThat he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,\nSuggest his soon-believing adversaries,\nAnd consequently, like a traitor coward,\nSluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:\nWhich blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,\nEven from the tongueless caverns of the earth,\nTo me for justice and rough chastisement;\nAnd, by the glorious worth of my descent,\nThis arm shall do it, or this life be spent.\nKING RICHARD II\nHow high a pitch his resolution soars!\nThomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY\nO, let my sovereign turn away his face\nAnd bid his ears a little while be deaf,\nTill I have told this slander of his blood,\nHow God and good men hate so foul a liar.\nKING RICHARD II\nMowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:\nWere he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,\nAs he is but my father's brother's son,\nNow, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,\nSuch neighbour nearness to our sacred blood\nShould nothing privilege him, nor partialize\nThe unstooping firmness of my upright soul:\nHe is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:\nFree speech and fearless I to thee allow.\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY\nThen, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,\nThrough the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.\nThree parts of that receipt I had for Calais\nDisbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;\nThe other part reserved I by consent,\nFor that my sovereign liege was in my debt\nUpon remainder of a dear account,\nSince last I went to France to fetch his queen:\nNow swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,\nI slew him not; but to my own disgrace\nNeglected my sworn duty in that case.\nFor you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,\nThe honourable father to my foe\nOnce did I lay an ambush for your life,\nA trespass that doth vex my grieved soul\nBut ere I last received the sacrament\nI did confess it, and exactly begg'd\nYour grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.\nThis is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,\nIt issues from the rancour of a villain,\nA recreant and most degenerate traitor\nWhich in myself I boldly will defend;\nAnd interchangeably hurl down my gage\nUpon this overweening traitor's foot,\nTo prove myself a loyal gentleman\nEven in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.\nIn haste whereof, most heartily I pray\nYour highness to assign our trial day.\nKING RICHARD II\nWrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;\nLet's purge this choler without letting blood:\nThis we prescribe, though no physician;\nDeep malice makes too deep incision;\nForget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;\nOur doctors say this is no month to bleed.\nGood uncle, let this end where it begun;\nWe'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nTo be a make-peace shall become my age:\nThrow down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.\nKING RICHARD II\nAnd, Norfolk, throw down his.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nWhen, Harry, when?\nObedience bids I should not bid again.\nKING RICHARD II\nNorfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY\nMyself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.\nMy life thou shalt command, but not my shame:\nThe one my duty owes; but my fair name,\nDespite of death that lives upon my grave,\nTo dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.\nI am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,\nPierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,\nThe which no balm can cure but his heart-blood\nWhich breathed this poison.\nKING RICHARD II\nRage must be withstood:\nGive me his gage: lions make leopards tame.\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY\nYea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.\nAnd I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,\nThe purest treasure mortal times afford\nIs spotless reputation: that away,\nMen are but gilded loam or painted clay.\nA jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest\nIs a bold spirit in a loyal breast.\nMine honour is my life; both grow in one:\nTake honour from me, and my life is done:\nThen, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;\nIn that I live and for that will I die.\nKING RICHARD II\nCousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nO, God defend my soul from such deep sin!\nShall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?\nOr with pale beggar-fear impeach my height\nBefore this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue\nShall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,\nOr sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear\nThe slavish motive of recanting fear,\nAnd spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,\nWhere shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.\nExit JOHN OF GAUNT\n\nKING RICHARD II\nWe were not born to sue, but to command;\nWhich since we cannot do to make you friends,\nBe ready, as your lives shall answer it,\nAt Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:\nThere shall your swords and lances arbitrate\nThe swelling difference of your settled hate:\nSince we can not atone you, we shall see\nJustice design the victor's chivalry.\nLord marshal, command our officers at arms\nBe ready to direct these home alarms.\nExeunt",

Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE\nCousin, farewell: what presence must not know,\nFrom where you do remain let paper show.\nLord Marshal\nMy lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,\nAs far as land will let me, by your side.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nO, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,\nThat thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nI have too few to take my leave of you,\nWhen the tongue's office should be prodigal\nTo breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nThy grief is but thy absence for a time.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nJoy absent, grief is present for that time.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nWhat is six winters? they are quickly gone.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nTo men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nCall it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nMy heart will sigh when I miscall it so,\nWhich finds it an inforced pilgrimage.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nThe sullen passage of thy weary steps\nEsteem as foil wherein thou art to set\nThe precious jewel of thy home return.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nNay, rather, every tedious stride I make\nWill but remember me what a deal of world\nI wander from the jewels that I love.\nMust I not serve a long apprenticehood\nTo foreign passages, and in the end,\nHaving my freedom, boast of nothing else\nBut that I was a journeyman to grief?\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nAll places that the eye of heaven visits\nAre to a wise man ports and happy havens.\nTeach thy necessity to reason thus;\nThere is no virtue like necessity.\nThink not the king did banish thee,\nBut thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,\nWhere it perceives it is but faintly borne.\nGo, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour\nAnd not the king exiled thee; or suppose\nDevouring pestilence hangs in our air\nAnd thou art flying to a fresher clime:\nLook, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it\nTo lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:\nSuppose the singing birds musicians,\nThe grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,\nThe flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more\nThan a delightful measure or a dance;\nFor gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite\nThe man that mocks at it and sets it light.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nO, who can hold a fire in his hand\nBy thinking on the frosty Caucasus?\nOr cloy the hungry edge of appetite\nBy bare imagination of a feast?\nOr wallow naked in December snow\nBy thinking on fantastic summer's heat?\nO, no! the apprehension of the good\nGives but the greater feeling to the worse:\nFell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more\nThan when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.\nJOHN OF GAUNT\nCome, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:\nHad I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nThen, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;\nMy mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!\nWhere'er I wander, boast of this I can,\nThough banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.\nExeunt",

But who comes here?\nEnter LORD BERKELEY\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nIt is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.\nLORD BERKELEY\nMy Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nMy lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;\nAnd I am come to seek that name in England;\nAnd I must find that title in your tongue,\nBefore I make reply to aught you say.\nLORD BERKELEY\nMistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning\nTo raze one title of your honour out:\nTo you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,\nFrom the most gracious regent of this land,\nThe Duke of York, to know what pricks you on\nTo take advantage of the absent time\nAnd fright our native peace with self-born arms.\nEnter DUKE OF YORK attended\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nI shall not need transport my words by you;\nHere comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!\nKneels\n\nDUKE OF YORK\nShow me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,\nWhose duty is deceiveable and false.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nMy gracious uncle--\nDUKE OF YORK\nTut, tut!\nGrace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:\nI am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'\nIn an ungracious mouth is but profane.\nWhy have those banish'd and forbidden legs\nDared once to touch a dust of England's ground?\nBut then more 'why?' why have they dared to march\nSo many miles upon her peaceful bosom,\nFrighting her pale-faced villages with war\nAnd ostentation of despised arms?\nComest thou because the anointed king is hence?\nWhy, foolish boy, the king is left behind,\nAnd in my loyal bosom lies his power.\nWere I but now the lord of such hot youth\nAs when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself\nRescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,\nFrom forth the ranks of many thousand French,\nO, then how quickly should this arm of mine.\nNow prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee\nAnd minister correction to thy fault!\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nMy gracious uncle, let me know my fault:\nOn what condition stands it and wherein?\nDUKE OF YORK\nEven in condition of the worst degree,\nIn gross rebellion and detested treason:\nThou art a banish'd man, and here art come\nBefore the expiration of thy time,\nIn braving arms against thy sovereign.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nAs I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;\nBut as I come, I come for Lancaster.\nAnd, noble uncle, I beseech your grace\nLook on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:\nYou are my father, for methinks in you\nI see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,\nWill you permit that I shall stand condemn'd\nA wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties\nPluck'd from my arms perforce and given away\nTo upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?\nIf that my cousin king be King of England,\nIt must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.\nYou have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;\nHad you first died, and he been thus trod down,\nHe should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,\nTo rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.\nI am denied to sue my livery here,\nAnd yet my letters-patents give me leave:\nMy father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,\nAnd these and all are all amiss employ'd.\nWhat would you have me do? I am a subject,\nAnd I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;\nAnd therefore, personally I lay my claim\nTo my inheritance of free descent.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nThe noble duke hath been too much abused.\nLORD ROSS\nIt stands your grace upon to do him right.\nLORD WILLOUGHBY\nBase men by his endowments are made great.\nDUKE OF YORK\nMy lords of England, let me tell you this:\nI have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs\nAnd laboured all I could to do him right;\nBut in this kind to come, in braving arms,\nBe his own carver and cut out his way,\nTo find out right with wrong, it may not be;\nAnd you that do abet him in this kind\nCherish rebellion and are rebels all.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nThe noble duke hath sworn his coming is\nBut for his own; and for the right of that\nWe all have strongly sworn to give him aid;\nAnd let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!\nDUKE OF YORK\nWell, well, I see the issue of these arms:\nI cannot mend it, I must needs confess,\nBecause my power is weak and all ill left:\nBut if I could, by Him that gave me life,\nI would attach you all and make you stoop\nUnto the sovereign mercy of the king;\nBut since I cannot, be it known to you\nI do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;\nUnless you please to enter in the castle\nAnd there repose you for this night.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nAn offer, uncle, that we will accept:\nBut we must win your grace to go with us\nTo Bristol castle, which they say is held\nBy Bushy, Bagot and their complices,\nThe caterpillars of the commonwealth,\nWhich I have sworn to weed and pluck away.\nDUKE OF YORK\nIt may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;\nFor I am loath to break our country's laws.\nNor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:\nThings past redress are now with me past care.\nExeunt"

I'll give thee scope to beat,\nSince foes have scope to beat both thee and me.\nDUKE OF AUMERLE\nNorthumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.\nKING RICHARD II\nWhat must the king do now? must he submit?\nThe king shall do it: must he be deposed?\nThe king shall be contented: must he lose\nThe name of king? o' God's name, let it go:\nI'll give my jewels for a set of beads,\nMy gorgeous palace for a hermitage,\nMy gay apparel for an almsman's gown,\nMy figured goblets for a dish of wood,\nMy sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,\nMy subjects for a pair of carved saints\nAnd my large kingdom for a little grave,\nA little little grave, an obscure grave;\nOr I'll be buried in the king's highway,\nSome way of common trade, where subjects' feet\nMay hourly trample on their sovereign's head;\nFor on my heart they tread now whilst I live;\nAnd buried once, why not upon my head?\nAumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!\nWe'll make foul weather with despised tears;\nOur sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,\nAnd make a dearth in this revolting land.\nOr shall we play the wantons with our woes,\nAnd make some pretty match with shedding tears?\nAs thus, to drop them still upon one place,\nTill they have fretted us a pair of graves\nWithin the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies\nTwo kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.\nWould not this ill do well? Well, well, I see\nI talk but idly, and you laugh at me.\nMost mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,\nWhat says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty\nGive Richard leave to live till Richard die?\nYou make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nMy lord, in the base court he doth attend\nTo speak with you; may it please you to come down.\nKING RICHARD II\nDown, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,\nWanting the manage of unruly jades.\nIn the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,\nTo come at traitors' calls and do them grace.\nIn the base court? Come down? Down, court!\ndown, king!\nFor night-owls shriek where mounting larks\nshould sing.\nExeunt from above\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nWhat says his majesty?\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nSorrow and grief of heart\nMakes him speak fondly, like a frantic man\nYet he is come.\nEnter KING RICHARD and his attendants below\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nStand all apart,\nAnd show fair duty to his majesty.\nHe kneels down\n\nMy gracious lord,--\nKING RICHARD II\nFair cousin, you debase your princely knee\nTo make the base earth proud with kissing it:\nMe rather had my heart might feel your love\nThan my unpleased eye see your courtesy.\nUp, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,\nThus high at least, although your knee be low.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nMy gracious lord, I come but for mine own.\nKING RICHARD II\nYour own is yours, and I am yours, and all.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nSo far be mine, my most redoubted lord,\nAs my true service shall deserve your love.\nKING RICHARD II\nWell you deserve: they well deserve to have,\nThat know the strong'st and surest way to get.\nUncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;\nTears show their love, but want their remedies.\nCousin, I am too young to be your father,\nThough you are old enough to be my heir.\nWhat you will have, I'll give, and willing too;\nFor do we must what force will have us do.\nSet on towards London, cousin, is it so?\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nYea, my good lord.\nKING RICHARD II\nThen I must not say no.\nFlourish.

Yet I well remember\nThe favours of these men: were they not mine?\nDid they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?\nSo Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,\nFound truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.\nGod save the king!

Gentle Northumberland,\nIf thy offences were upon record,\nWould it not shame thee in so fair a troop\nTo read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,\nThere shouldst thou find one heinous article,\nContaining the deposing of a king\nAnd cracking the strong warrant of an oath,\nMark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:\nNay, all of you that stand and look upon,\nWhilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,\nThough some of you with Pilate wash your hands\nShowing an outward pity; yet you Pilates\nHave here deliver'd me to my sour cross,\nAnd water cannot wash away your sin.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nMy lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.\nKING RICHARD II\nMine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:\nAnd yet salt water blinds them not so much\nBut they can see a sort of traitors here.\nNay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,\nI find myself a traitor with the rest;\nFor I have given here my soul's consent\nTo undeck the pompous body of a king;\nMade glory base and sovereignty a slave,\nProud majesty a subject, state a peasant.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nMy lord,--\nKING RICHARD II\nNo lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,\nNor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,\nNo, not that name was given me at the font,\nBut 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,\nThat I have worn so many winters out,\nAnd know not now what name to call myself!\nO that I were a mockery king of snow,\nStanding before the sun of Bolingbroke,\nTo melt myself away in water-drops!\nGood king, great king, and yet not greatly good,\nAn if my word be sterling yet in England,\nLet it command a mirror hither straight,\nThat it may show me what a face I have,\nSince it is bankrupt of his majesty.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nGo some of you and fetch a looking-glass.\nExit an attendant\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nRead o'er this paper while the glass doth come.\nKING RICHARD II\nFiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nUrge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nThe commons will not then be satisfied.\nKING RICHARD II\nThey shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,\nWhen I do see the very book indeed\nWhere all my sins are writ, and that's myself.\nRe-enter Attendant, with a glass\n\nGive me the glass, and therein will I read.\nNo deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck\nSo many blows upon this face of mine,\nAnd made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,\nLike to my followers in prosperity,\nThou dost beguile me! Was this face the face\nThat every day under his household roof\nDid keep ten thousand men? was this the face\nThat, like the sun, did make beholders wink?\nWas this the face that faced so many follies,\nAnd was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?\nA brittle glory shineth in this face:\nAs brittle as the glory is the face;\nDashes the glass against the ground\n\nFor there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.\nMark, silent king, the moral of this sport,\nHow soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nThe shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd\nThe shadow or your face.\nKING RICHARD II\nSay that again.\nThe shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:\n'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;\nAnd these external manners of laments\nAre merely shadows to the unseen grief\nThat swells with silence in the tortured soul;\nThere lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,\nFor thy great bounty, that not only givest\nMe cause to wail but teachest me the way\nHow to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,\nAnd then be gone and trouble you no more.\nShall I obtain it?\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nName it, fair cousin.\nKING RICHARD II\n'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:\nFor when I was a king, my flatterers\nWere then but subjects; being now a subject,\nI have a king here to my flatterer.\nBeing so great, I have no need to beg.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nYet ask.\nKING RICHARD II\nAnd shall I have?\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nYou shall.\nKING RICHARD II\nThen give me leave to go.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nWhither?\nKING RICHARD II\nWhither you will, so I were from your sights.\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nGo, some of you convey him to the Tower.\nKING RICHARD II\nO, good! convey? conveyers are you all,\nThat rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.\nExeunt KING RICHARD II, some Lords, and a Guard\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE\nOn Wednesday next we solemnly set down\nOur coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.\nExeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot of Westminster, and DUKE OF AUMERLE\n\nAbbot\nA woeful pageant have we here beheld.\nBISHOP OF CARLISLE\nThe woe's to come; the children yet unborn.\nShall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.\nDUKE OF AUMERLE\nYou holy clergymen, is there no plot\nTo rid the realm of this pernicious blot?\nAbbot\nMy lord,\nBefore I freely speak my mind herein,\nYou shall not only take the sacrament\nTo bury mine intents, but also to effect\nWhatever I shall happen to devise.\nI see your brows are full of discontent,\nYour hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:\nCome home with me to supper; and I'll lay\nA plot shall show us all a merry day.\nExeunt",

Hie thee to France\nAnd cloister thee in some religious house:\nOur holy lives must win a new world's crown,\nWhich our profane hours here have stricken down.\nQUEEN\nWhat, is my Richard both in shape and mind\nTransform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed\nThine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?\nThe lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,\nAnd wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage\nTo be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,\nTake thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,\nAnd fawn on rage with base humility,\nWhich art a lion and a king of beasts?\nKING RICHARD II\nA king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,\nI had been still a happy king of men.\nGood sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:\nThink I am dead and that even here thou takest,\nAs from my death-bed, thy last living leave.\nIn winter's tedious nights sit by the fire\nWith good old folks and let them tell thee tales\nOf woeful ages long ago betid;\nAnd ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,\nTell thou the lamentable tale of me\nAnd send the hearers weeping to their beds:\nFor why, the senseless brands will sympathize\nThe heavy accent of thy moving tongue\nAnd in compassion weep the fire out;\nAnd some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,\nFor the deposing of a rightful king.\nEnter NORTHUMBERLAND and others\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nMy lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:\nYou must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.\nAnd, madam, there is order ta'en for you;\nWith all swift speed you must away to France.\nKING RICHARD II\nNorthumberland, thou ladder wherewithal\nThe mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,\nThe time shall not be many hours of age\nMore than it is ere foul sin gathering head\nShalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,\nThough he divide the realm and give thee half,\nIt is too little, helping him to all;\nAnd he shall think that thou, which know'st the way\nTo plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,\nBeing ne'er so little urged, another way\nTo pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.\nThe love of wicked men converts to fear;\nThat fear to hate, and hate turns one or both\nTo worthy danger and deserved death.\nNORTHUMBERLAND\nMy guilt be on my head, and there an end.\nTake leave and part; for you must part forthwith.\nKING RICHARD II\nDoubly divorced!
