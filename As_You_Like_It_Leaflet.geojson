    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. An Orchard near Oliver’s house\nEnter Orlando and Adam.\n\nORLANDO.\nAs I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.\n\nEnter Oliver.\n\nADAM.\nYonder comes my master, your brother.\n\nORLANDO.\nGo apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.\n\n[Adam retires.]\n\nOLIVER.\nNow, sir, what make you here?\n\nORLANDO.\nNothing. I am not taught to make anything.\n\nOLIVER.\nWhat mar you then, sir?\n\nORLANDO.\nMarry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.\n\nOLIVER.\nMarry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.\n\nORLANDO.\nShall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?\n\nOLIVER.\nKnow you where you are, sir?\n\nORLANDO.\nO, sir, very well: here in your orchard.\n\nOLIVER.\nKnow you before whom, sir?\n\nORLANDO.\nAy, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.\n\nOLIVER.\nWhat, boy!\n\nORLANDO.\nCome, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\n\nOLIVER.\nWilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\n\nORLANDO.\nI am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so. Thou has railed on thyself.\n\nADAM.\n[Coming forward.] Sweet masters, be patient. For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.\n\nOLIVER.\nLet me go, I say.\n\nORLANDO.\nI will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.\n\nOLIVER.\nAnd what wilt thou do? Beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you. You shall have some part of your will. I pray you leave me.\n\nORLANDO.\nI no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\n\nOLIVER.\nGet you with him, you old dog.\n\nADAM.\nIs “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master. He would not have spoke such a word.\n\n[Exeunt Orlando and Adam.]\n\nOLIVER.\nIs it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!\n\nEnter Dennis.\n\nDENNIS\nCalls your worship?\n\nOLIVER.\nWas not Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?\n\nDENNIS\nSo please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.\n\nOLIVER.\nCall him in.\n\n[Exit Dennis.]\n\n’Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.\n\nEnter Charles.\n\nCHARLES.\nGood morrow to your worship.\n\nOLIVER.\nGood Monsieur Charles. What’s the new news at the new court?\n\nCHARLES.\nThere’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.\n\nOLIVER.\nCan you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?\n\nCHARLES.\nO, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.\n\nOLIVER.\nWhere will the old Duke live?\n\nCHARLES.\nThey say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\n\nOLIVER.\nWhat, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?\n\nCHARLES.\nMarry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honour if he come in. Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.\n\nOLIVER.\nCharles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.\n\nCHARLES.\nI am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOLIVER.\nFarewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul—yet I know not why—hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. A Lawn before the Duke’s Palace\nEnter Rosalind and Celia.\n\nCELIA.\nI pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\n\nROSALIND.\nDear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.\n\nCELIA.\nHerein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.\n\nROSALIND.\nWell, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.\n\nCELIA.\nYou know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honour I will! And when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.\n\nROSALIND.\nFrom henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of falling in love?\n\nCELIA.\nMarry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhat shall be our sport, then?\n\nCELIA.\nLet us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.\n\nROSALIND.\nI would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.\n\nCELIA.\n’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.\n\nEnter Touchstone.\n\nCELIA.\nNo? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?\n\nROSALIND.\nIndeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.\n\nCELIA.\nPeradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.—How now, wit, whither wander you?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nMistress, you must come away to your father.\n\nCELIA.\nWere you made the messenger?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nNo, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhere learned you that oath, fool?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nOf a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.\n\nCELIA.\nHow prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?\n\nROSALIND.\nAy, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nStand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.\n\nCELIA.\nBy our beards, if we had them, thou art.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nBy my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard.\n\nCELIA.\nPrithee, who is’t that thou mean’st?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nOne that old Frederick, your father, loves.\n\nCELIA.\nMy father’s love is enough to honour him. Enough! Speak no more of him. You’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nThe more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.\n\nCELIA.\nBy my troth, thou sayest true. For since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.\n\nEnter Le Beau.\n\nROSALIND.\nWith his mouth full of news.\n\nCELIA.\nWhich he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.\n\nROSALIND.\nThen shall we be news-crammed.\n\nCELIA.\nAll the better; we shall be the more marketable.\nBonjour, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s the news?\n\nLE BEAU.\nFair princess, you have lost much good sport.\n\nCELIA.\nSport! Of what colour?\n\nLE BEAU.\nWhat colour, madam? How shall I answer you?\n\nROSALIND.\nAs wit and fortune will.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nOr as the destinies decrees.\n\nCELIA.\nWell said. That was laid on with a trowel.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nNay, if I keep not my rank—\n\nROSALIND.\nThou losest thy old smell.\n\nLE BEAU.\nYou amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.\n\nROSALIND.\nYet tell us the manner of the wrestling.\n\nLE BEAU.\nI will tell you the beginning and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.\n\nCELIA.\nWell, the beginning that is dead and buried.\n\nLE BEAU.\nThere comes an old man and his three sons—\n\nCELIA.\nI could match this beginning with an old tale.\n\nLE BEAU.\nThree proper young men of excellent growth and presence.\n\nROSALIND.\nWith bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”\n\nLE BEAU.\nThe eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.\n\nROSALIND.\nAlas!\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nBut what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?\n\nLE BEAU.\nWhy, this that I speak of.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nThus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.\n\nCELIA.\nOr I, I promise thee.\n\nROSALIND.\nBut is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?\n\nLE BEAU.\nYou must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.\n\nCELIA.\nYonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.\n\nFlourish. Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando, Charles and Attendants.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nCome on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.\n\nROSALIND.\nIs yonder the man?\n\nLE BEAU.\nEven he, madam.\n\nCELIA.\nAlas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nHow now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?\n\nROSALIND.\nAy, my liege, so please you give us leave.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nYou will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger’s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.\n\nCELIA.\nCall him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nDo so; I’ll not be by.\n\n[Duke Frederick steps aside.]\n\nLE BEAU.\nMonsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.\n\nORLANDO.\nI attend them with all respect and duty.\n\nROSALIND.\nYoung man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?\n\nORLANDO.\nNo, fair princess. He is the general challenger. I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.\n\nCELIA.\nYoung gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.\n\nROSALIND.\nDo, young sir. Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.\n\nORLANDO.\nI beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.\n\nROSALIND.\nThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you.\n\nCELIA.\nAnd mine to eke out hers.\n\nROSALIND.\nFare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in you.\n\nCELIA.\nYour heart’s desires be with you.\n\nCHARLES.\nCome, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?\n\nORLANDO.\nReady, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nYou shall try but one fall.\n\nCHARLES.\nNo, I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.\n\nORLANDO.\nYou mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before. But come your ways.\n\nROSALIND.\nNow, Hercules be thy speed, young man!\n\nCELIA.\nI would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.\n\n[Orlando and Charles wrestle.]\n\nROSALIND.\nO excellent young man!\n\nCELIA.\nIf I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.\n\n[Charles is thrown. Shout.]\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nNo more, no more.\n\nORLANDO.\nYes, I beseech your grace. I am not yet well breathed.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nHow dost thou, Charles?\n\nLE BEAU.\nHe cannot speak, my lord.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nBear him away.\n\n[Charles is carried off by Attendants.]\n\nWhat is thy name, young man?\n\nORLANDO.\nOrlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.\n\nDUKE FREDERICK.\nI would thou hadst been son to some man else.\nThe world esteemed thy father honourable,\nBut I did find him still mine enemy.\nThou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed\nHadst thou descended from another house.\nBut fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth.\nI would thou hadst told me of another father.\n\n[Exeunt Duke Frederick, Le Beau and Lords.]\n\nCELIA.\nWere I my father, coz, would I do this?\n\nORLANDO.\nI am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,\nHis youngest son, and would not change that calling\nTo be adopted heir to Frederick.\n\nROSALIND.\nMy father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,\nAnd all the world was of my father’s mind.\nHad I before known this young man his son,\nI should have given him tears unto entreaties\nEre he should thus have ventured.\n\nCELIA.\nGentle cousin,\nLet us go thank him and encourage him.\nMy father’s rough and envious disposition\nSticks me at heart.—Sir, you have well deserved.\nIf you do keep your promises in love\nBut justly, as you have exceeded promise,\nYour mistress shall be happy.\n\nROSALIND.\nGentleman,\n\n[Giving him a chain from her neck.]\n\nWear this for me—one out of suits with Fortune,\nThat could give more but that her hand lacks means.—\nShall we go, coz?\n\nCELIA.\nAy.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.\n\nORLANDO.\nCan I not say, I thank you? My better parts\nAre all thrown down, and that which here stands up\nIs but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.\n\nROSALIND.\nHe calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes.\nI’ll ask him what he would.—Did you call, sir?—\nSir, you have wrestled well and overthrown\nMore than your enemies.\n\nCELIA.\nWill you go, coz?\n\nROSALIND.\nHave with you.—Fare you well.\n\n[Exeunt Rosalind and Celia.]\n\nORLANDO.\nWhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?\nI cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.\nO poor Orlando, thou art overthrown.\nOr Charles or something weaker masters thee.\n\nEnter Le Beau.\n\nLE BEAU.\nGood sir, I do in friendship counsel you\nTo leave this place. Albeit you have deserved\nHigh commendation, true applause, and love,\nYet such is now the Duke’s condition\nThat he misconsters all that you have done.\nThe Duke is humorous; what he is indeed\nMore suits you to conceive than I to speak of.\n\nORLANDO.\nI thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:\nWhich of the two was daughter of the Duke\nThat here was at the wrestling?\n\nLE BEAU.\nNeither his daughter, if we judge by manners,\nBut yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.\nThe other is daughter to the banished Duke,\nAnd here detained by her usurping uncle\nTo keep his daughter company, whose loves\nAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters.\nBut I can tell you that of late this Duke\nHath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,\nGrounded upon no other argument\nBut that the people praise her for her virtues\nAnd pity her for her good father’s sake;\nAnd, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady\nWill suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.\nHereafter, in a better world than this,\nI shall desire more love and knowledge of you.\n\nORLANDO.\nI rest much bounden to you; fare you well!\n\n[Exit Le Beau.]\n\nThus must I from the smoke into the smother,\nFrom tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.\nBut heavenly Rosalind!\n\n[Exit.]",

Not a word?\n\nROSALIND.\nNot one to throw at a dog.\n\nCELIA.\nNo, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs. Throw some of them at me. Come, lame me with reasons.\n\nROSALIND.\nThen there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.\n\nCELIA.\nBut is all this for your father?\n\nROSALIND.\nNo, some of it is for my child’s father. O, how full of briers is this working-day world!\n\nCELIA.\nThey are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery.

Shall we part, sweet girl?\nNo, let my father seek another heir.\nTherefore devise with me how we may fly,\nWhither to go, and what to bear with us,\nAnd do not seek to take your change upon you,\nTo bear your griefs yourself and leave me out.\nFor, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,\nSay what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhy, whither shall we go?\n\nCELIA.\nTo seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.\n\nROSALIND.\nAlas, what danger will it be to us,\nMaids as we are, to travel forth so far?\nBeauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\n\nCELIA.\nI’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,\nAnd with a kind of umber smirch my face.\nThe like do you; so shall we pass along\nAnd never stir assailants.\n\nROSALIND.\nWere it not better,\nBecause that I am more than common tall,\nThat I did suit me all points like a man?\nA gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh,\nA boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart\nLie there what hidden woman’s fear there will,\nWe’ll have a swashing and a martial outside,\nAs many other mannish cowards have\nThat do outface it with their semblances.\n\nCELIA.\nWhat shall I call thee when thou art a man?\n\nROSALIND.\nI’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,\nAnd therefore look you call me Ganymede.\nBut what will you be called?\n\nCELIA.\nSomething that hath a reference to my state:\nNo longer Celia, but Aliena.\n\nROSALIND.\nBut, cousin, what if we assayed to steal\nThe clownish fool out of your father’s court?\nWould he not be a comfort to our travel?\n\nCELIA.\nHe’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.\nLeave me alone to woo him. Let’s away,\nAnd get our jewels and our wealth together,\nDevise the fittest time and safest way\nTo hide us from pursuit that will be made\nAfter my flight. Now go we in content\nTo liberty, and not to banishment.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Are not these woods\nMore free from peril than the envious court?\nHere feel we not the penalty of Adam,\nThe seasons’ difference, as the icy fang\nAnd churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,\nWhich when it bites and blows upon my body\nEven till I shrink with cold, I smile and say:\n“This is no flattery. These are counsellors\nThat feelingly persuade me what I am.”\nSweet are the uses of adversity,\nWhich, like the toad, ugly and venomous,\nWears yet a precious jewel in his head;\nAnd this our life, exempt from public haunt,\nFinds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\nSermons in stones, and good in everything.\n\nAMIENS.\nI would not change it. Happy is your grace,\nThat can translate the stubbornness of fortune\nInto so quiet and so sweet a style.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nCome, shall we go and kill us venison?\nAnd yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,\nBeing native burghers of this desert city,\nShould in their own confines with forked heads\nHave their round haunches gored.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIndeed, my lord,\nThe melancholy Jaques grieves at that,\nAnd in that kind swears you do more usurp\nThan doth your brother that hath banished you.\nToday my lord of Amiens and myself\nDid steal behind him as he lay along\nUnder an oak, whose antique root peeps out\nUpon the brook that brawls along this wood;\nTo the which place a poor sequestered stag,\nThat from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,\nDid come to languish; and indeed, my lord,\nThe wretched animal heaved forth such groans\nThat their discharge did stretch his leathern coat\nAlmost to bursting, and the big round tears\nCoursed one another down his innocent nose\nIn piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,\nMuch marked of the melancholy Jaques,\nStood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,\nAugmenting it with tears.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nBut what said Jaques?\nDid he not moralize this spectacle?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO yes, into a thousand similes.\nFirst, for his weeping into the needless stream:\n“Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament\nAs worldlings do, giving thy sum of more\nTo that which had too much.” Then, being there alone,\nLeft and abandoned of his velvet friends:\n“’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part\nThe flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,\nFull of the pasture, jumps along by him\nAnd never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,\n“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens!\n’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look\nUpon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”\nThus most invectively he pierceth through\nThe body of the country, city, court,\nYea, and of this our life, swearing that we\nAre mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,\nTo fright the animals and to kill them up\nIn their assigned and native dwelling-place.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nAnd did you leave him in this contemplation?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWe did, my lord, weeping and commenting\nUpon the sobbing deer.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nShow me the place.\nI love to cope him in these sullen fits,\nFor then he’s full of matter.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI’ll bring you to him straight.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A miserable world!\nAs I do live by food, I met a fool,\nWho laid him down and basked him in the sun,\nAnd railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,\nIn good set terms, and yet a motley fool.\n“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,\n“Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.”\nAnd then he drew a dial from his poke,\nAnd, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\nSays very wisely, “It is ten o’clock.\nThus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.\n’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,\nAnd after one hour more ’twill be eleven.\nAnd so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,\nAnd then from hour to hour we rot and rot,\nAnd thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear\nThe motley fool thus moral on the time,\nMy lungs began to crow like chanticleer,\nThat fools should be so deep-contemplative,\nAnd I did laugh sans intermission\nAn hour by his dial.

And why, sir, must they so?\nThe “why” is plain as way to parish church.\nHe that a fool doth very wisely hit\nDoth very foolishly, although he smart,\nNot to seem senseless of the bob. If not,\nThe wise man’s folly is anatomized\nEven by the squandering glances of the fool.\nInvest me in my motley.

How then, what then? Let me see wherein\nMy tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,\nThen he hath wronged himself. If he be free,\nWhy then my taxing like a wild-goose flies\nUnclaimed of any man.

But whate’er you are\nThat in this desert inaccessible,\nUnder the shade of melancholy boughs,\nLose and neglect the creeping hours of time,\nIf ever you have looked on better days,\nIf ever been where bells have knolled to church,\nIf ever sat at any good man’s feast,\nIf ever from your eyelids wiped a tear,\nAnd know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,\nLet gentleness my strong enforcement be,\nIn the which hope I blush and hide my sword.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nTrue is it that we have seen better days,\nAnd have with holy bell been knolled to church,\nAnd sat at good men’s feasts, and wiped our eyes\nOf drops that sacred pity hath engendered.\nAnd therefore sit you down in gentleness,\nAnd take upon command what help we have\nThat to your wanting may be ministered.\n\nORLANDO.\nThen but forbear your food a little while,\nWhiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,\nAnd give it food. There is an old poor man\nWho after me hath many a weary step\nLimped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,\nOppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,\nI will not touch a bit.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nGo find him out,\nAnd we will nothing waste till you return.\n\nORLANDO.\nI thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nThou seest we are not all alone unhappy.\nThis wide and universal theatre\nPresents more woeful pageants than the scene\nWherein we play in.\n\nJAQUES.\nAll the world’s a stage,\nAnd all the men and women merely players;\nThey have their exits and their entrances,\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts,\nHis acts being seven ages. At first the infant,\nMewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;\nThen the whining schoolboy, with his satchel\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snail\nUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,\nSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\nMade to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,\nFull of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\nJealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\nSeeking the bubble reputation\nEven in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,\nIn fair round belly with good capon lined,\nWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\nFull of wise saws and modern instances;\nAnd so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\nInto the lean and slippered pantaloon,\nWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\nHis youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\nFor his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,\nTurning again toward childish treble, pipes\nAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\nThat ends this strange eventful history,\nIs second childishness and mere oblivion,\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\n\nEnter Orlando bearing Adam.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nWelcome. Set down your venerable burden,\nAnd let him feed.\n\nORLANDO.\nI thank you most for him.\n\nADAM.\nSo had you need;\nI scarce can speak to thank you for myself.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nWelcome, fall to. I will not trouble you\nAs yet to question you about your fortunes.\nGive us some music, and good cousin, sing.\n\nSONG.\n\nAMIENS. (Sings.)\n        Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\n        Thou art not so unkind\n            As man’s ingratitude.\n        Thy tooth is not so keen,\n        Because thou art not seen,\n            Although thy breath be rude.\nHeigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.\nMost friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.\n        Then, heigh-ho, the holly!\n            This life is most jolly.\n\n        Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\n        That dost not bite so nigh\n            As benefits forgot.\n        Though thou the waters warp,\n        Thy sting is not so sharp\n            As friend remembered not.\nHeigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.\nMost friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.\n        Then, heigh-ho, the holly!\n            This life is most jolly.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nIf that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son,\nAs you have whispered faithfully you were,\nAnd as mine eye doth his effigies witness\nMost truly limned and living in your face,\nBe truly welcome hither. I am the Duke\nThat loved your father. The residue of your fortune\nGo to my cave and tell me.—Good old man,\nThou art right welcome as thy master is.\nSupport him by the arm. [To Orlando.] Give me your hand,\nAnd let me all your fortunes understand.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. The Forest of Arden\nEnter Orlando with a paper.\n\nORLANDO.\nHang there, my verse, in witness of my love.\n     And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey\nWith thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,\n     Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway.\nO Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,\n     And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character,\nThat every eye which in this forest looks\n     Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere.\nRun, run, Orlando, carve on every tree\nThe fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Corin and Touchstone.\n\nCORIN.\nAnd how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nTruly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?\n\nCORIN.\nNo more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nSuch a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?\n\nCORIN.\nNo, truly.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nThen thou art damned.\n\nCORIN.\nNay, I hope.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nTruly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.\n\nCORIN.\nFor not being at court? Your reason.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nWhy, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.\n\nCORIN.\nNot a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nInstance, briefly. Come, instance.\n\nCORIN.\nWhy, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nWhy, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say. Come.\n\nCORIN.\nBesides, our hands are hard.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nYour lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance, come.\n\nCORIN.\nAnd they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nMost shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise and perpend. Civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.\n\nCORIN.\nYou have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nWilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee, thou art raw.\n\nCORIN.\nSir, I am a true labourer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nThat is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape.\n\nEnter Rosalind as Ganymede.\n\nCORIN.\nHere comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.\n\nROSALIND.\n[Reads.]\n         From the east to western Inde\n         No jewel is like Rosalind.\n         Her worth being mounted on the wind,\n         Through all the world bears Rosalind.\n         All the pictures fairest lined\n         Are but black to Rosalind.\n         Let no face be kept in mind\n         But the fair of Rosalind.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nI’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted. It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.\n\nROSALIND.\nOut, fool!\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\n         For a taste:\n         If a hart do lack a hind,\n         Let him seek out Rosalind.\n         If the cat will after kind,\n         So be sure will Rosalind.\n         Winter garments must be lined,\n         So must slender Rosalind.\n         They that reap must sheaf and bind,\n         Then to cart with Rosalind.\n         Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,\n         Such a nut is Rosalind.\n         He that sweetest rose will find\n         Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.\nThis is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you infect yourself with them?\n\nROSALIND.\nPeace, you dull fool, I found them on a tree.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nTruly, the tree yields bad fruit.\n\nROSALIND.\nI’ll graft it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nYou have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.\n\nEnter Celia as Aliena, reading a paper.\n\nROSALIND.\nPeace, here comes my sister, reading. Stand aside.\n\nCELIA.\n[Reads.]\n            Why should this a desert be?\n                For it is unpeopled? No!\n            Tongues I’ll hang on every tree\n                That shall civil sayings show.\n            Some, how brief the life of man\n                Runs his erring pilgrimage,\n            That the streching of a span\n                Buckles in his sum of age;\n            Some, of violated vows\n                ’Twixt the souls of friend and friend.\n            But upon the fairest boughs,\n                Or at every sentence’ end,\n            Will I “Rosalinda” write,\n                Teaching all that read to know\n            The quintessence of every sprite\n                Heaven would in little show.\n            Therefore heaven nature charged\n                That one body should be filled\n            With all graces wide-enlarged.\n                Nature presently distilled\n            Helen’s cheek, but not her heart,\n                Cleopatra’s majesty;\n            Atalanta’s better part,\n                Sad Lucretia’s modesty.\n            Thus Rosalind of many parts\n                By heavenly synod was devised,\n            Of many faces, eyes, and hearts\n                To have the touches dearest prized.\n            Heaven would that she these gifts should have,\n                And I to live and die her slave.\n\nROSALIND.\nO most gentle Jupiter, what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried “Have patience, good people!”\n\nCELIA.\nHow now! Back, friends. Shepherd, go off a little. Go with him, sirrah.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nCome, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.\n\n[Exeunt Corin and Touchstone.]\n\nCELIA.\nDidst thou hear these verses?\n\nROSALIND.\nO yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.\n\nCELIA.\nThat’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.\n\nROSALIND.\nAy, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.\n\nCELIA.\nBut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?\n\nROSALIND.\nI was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’ time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.\n\nCELIA.\nTrow you who hath done this?\n\nROSALIND.\nIs it a man?\n\nCELIA.\nAnd a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change you colour?\n\nROSALIND.\nI prithee, who?\n\nCELIA.\nO Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter.\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, but who is it?\n\nCELIA.\nIs it possible?\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.\n\nCELIA.\nO wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!\n\nROSALIND.\nGood my complexion! Dost thou think, though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.\n\nCELIA.\nSo you may put a man in your belly.\n\nROSALIND.\nIs he of God’s making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?\n\nCELIA.\nNay, he hath but a little beard.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhy, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.\n\nCELIA.\nIt is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant.\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true maid.\n\nCELIA.\nI’ faith, coz, ’tis he.\n\nROSALIND.\nOrlando?\n\nCELIA.\nOrlando.\n\nROSALIND.\nAlas the day, what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou saw’st him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one word.\n\nCELIA.\nYou must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first. ’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.\n\nROSALIND.\nBut doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?\n\nCELIA.\nIt is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.\n\nROSALIND.\nIt may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.\n\nCELIA.\nGive me audience, good madam.\n\nROSALIND.\nProceed.\n\nCELIA.\nThere lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.\n\nROSALIND.\nThough it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.\n\nCELIA.\nCry “holla!” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.\n\nROSALIND.\nO, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.\n\nCELIA.\nI would sing my song without a burden. Thou bring’st me out of tune.\n\nROSALIND.\nDo you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.\n\nEnter Orlando and Jaques.\n\nCELIA.\nYou bring me out. Soft, comes he not here?\n\nROSALIND.\n’Tis he! Slink by, and note him.\n\n[Rosalind and Celia step aside.]\n\nJAQUES.\nI thank you for your company but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.\n\nORLANDO.\nAnd so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.\n\nJAQUES.\nGod be wi’ you, let’s meet as little as we can.\n\nORLANDO.\nI do desire we may be better strangers.\n\nJAQUES.\nI pray you, mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.\n\nORLANDO.\nI pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.\n\nJAQUES.\nRosalind is your love’s name?\n\nORLANDO.\nYes, just.\n\nJAQUES.\nI do not like her name.\n\nORLANDO.\nThere was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.\n\nJAQUES.\nWhat stature is she of?\n\nORLANDO.\nJust as high as my heart.\n\nJAQUES.\nYou are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives, and conned them out of rings?\n\nORLANDO.\nNot so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.\n\nJAQUES.\nYou have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery.\n\nORLANDO.\nI will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults.\n\nJAQUES.\nThe worst fault you have is to be in love.\n\nORLANDO.\n’Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.\n\nJAQUES.\nBy my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.\n\nORLANDO.\nHe is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and you shall see him.\n\nJAQUES.\nThere I shall see mine own figure.\n\nORLANDO.\nWhich I take to be either a fool or a cipher.\n\nJAQUES.\nI’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love.\n\nORLANDO.\nI am glad of your departure. Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.\n\n[Exit Jaques.—Celia and Rosalind come forward.]\n\nROSALIND.\nI will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him.\nDo you hear, forester?\n\nORLANDO.\nVery well. What would you?\n\nROSALIND.\nI pray you, what is’t o’clock?\n\nORLANDO.\nYou should ask me what time o’ day. There’s no clock in the forest.\n\nROSALIND.\nThen there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.\n\nORLANDO.\nAnd why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?\n\nROSALIND.\nBy no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.\n\nORLANDO.\nI prithee, who doth he trot withal?\n\nROSALIND.\nMarry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a se’nnight, time’s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.\n\nORLANDO.\nWho ambles time withal?\n\nROSALIND.\nWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These time ambles withal.\n\nORLANDO.\nWho doth he gallop withal?\n\nROSALIND.\nWith a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.\n\nORLANDO.\nWho stays it still withal?\n\nROSALIND.\nWith lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.\n\nORLANDO.\nWhere dwell you, pretty youth?\n\nROSALIND.\nWith this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.\n\nORLANDO.\nAre you native of this place?\n\nROSALIND.\nAs the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.\n\nORLANDO.\nYour accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.\n\nROSALIND.\nI have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.\n\nORLANDO.\nCan you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?\n\nROSALIND.\nThere were none principal. They were all like one another as halfpence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.\n\nORLANDO.\nI prithee recount some of them.\n\nROSALIND.\nNo. I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.\n\nORLANDO.\nI am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.\n\nROSALIND.\nThere is none of my uncle’s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.\n\nORLANDO.\nWhat were his marks?\n\nROSALIND.\nA lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.\n\nORLANDO.\nFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\n\nROSALIND.\nMe believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?\n\nORLANDO.\nI swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.\n\nROSALIND.\nBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\n\nORLANDO.\nNeither rhyme nor reason can express how much.\n\nROSALIND.\nLove is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.\n\nORLANDO.\nDid you ever cure any so?\n\nROSALIND.\nYes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in ’t.\n\nORLANDO.\nI would not be cured, youth.\n\nROSALIND.\nI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.\n\nORLANDO.\nNow, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.\n\nROSALIND.\nGo with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?\n\nORLANDO.\nWith all my heart, good youth.\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. Another part of the Forest\nEnter Touchstone and Audrey; Jaques at a distance observing them.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nCome apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?\n\nAUDREY.\nYour features, Lord warrant us! What features?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nI am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.\n\nJAQUES.\n[Aside.] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house!\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nWhen a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.\n\nAUDREY.\nI do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nNo, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said, as lovers, they do feign.\n\nAUDREY.\nDo you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nI do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.\n\nAUDREY.\nWould you not have me honest?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nNo, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.\n\nJAQUES.\n[Aside.] A material fool!\n\nAUDREY.\nWell, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nTruly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.\n\nAUDREY.\nI am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nWell, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee. And to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us.\n\nJAQUES.\n[Aside.] I would fain see this meeting.\n\nAUDREY.\nWell, the gods give us joy!\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nAmen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a man knows no end of his goods.” Right. Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.\n\nEnter Sir Oliver Martext.\n\nHere comes Sir Oliver. Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?\n\nMARTEXT.\nIs there none here to give the woman?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nI will not take her on gift of any man.\n\nMARTEXT.\nTruly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.\n\nJAQUES.\n[Coming forward.] Proceed, proceed. I’ll give her.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nGood even, good Master What-ye-call’t, how do you, sir? You are very well met. God ’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be covered.\n\nJAQUES.\nWill you be married, motley?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\n\nJAQUES.\nAnd will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is. This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber, warp, warp.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\n[Aside.] I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another, for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.\n\nJAQUES.\nGo thou with me, and let me counsel thee.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nCome, sweet Audrey. We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.\nFarewell, good Master Oliver. Not\n             O sweet Oliver,\n             O brave Oliver,\n         Leave me not behind thee.\nBut\n             Wind away,—\n             Begone, I say,\n         I will not to wedding with thee.\n\n[Exeunt Touchstone, Audrey and Jaques.]\n\nMARTEXT.\n’Tis no matter. Ne’er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.\n\n[Exit.]",

He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose.

Will you sterner be\nThan he that dies and lives by bloody drops?\n\nEnter Rosalind, Celia and Corin, at a distance.\n\nPHOEBE.\nI would not be thy executioner;\nI fly thee, for I would not injure thee.\nThou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.\n’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable\nThat eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,\nWho shut their coward gates on atomies,\nShould be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.\nNow I do frown on thee with all my heart,\nAnd if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.\nNow counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;\nOr if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,\nLie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.\nNow show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.\nScratch thee but with a pin, and there remains\nSome scar of it; lean upon a rush,\nThe cicatrice and capable impressure\nThy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,\nWhich I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;\nNor I am sure there is not force in eyes\nThat can do hurt.\n\nSILVIUS.\nO dear Phoebe,\nIf ever—as that ever may be near—\nYou meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,\nThen shall you know the wounds invisible\nThat love’s keen arrows make.\n\nPHOEBE.\nBut till that time\nCome not thou near me. And when that time comes,\nAfflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,\nAs till that time I shall not pity thee.\n\nROSALIND.\n[Advancing.] And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,\nThat you insult, exult, and all at once,\nOver the wretched? What though you have no beauty—\nAs, by my faith, I see no more in you\nThan without candle may go dark to bed—\nMust you be therefore proud and pitiless?\nWhy, what means this? Why do you look on me?\nI see no more in you than in the ordinary\nOf nature’s sale-work. ’Od’s my little life,\nI think she means to tangle my eyes too!\nNo, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.\n’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\nYour bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\nThat can entame my spirits to your worship.\nYou foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\nLike foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?\nYou are a thousand times a properer man\nThan she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you\nThat makes the world full of ill-favoured children.\n’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,\nAnd out of you she sees herself more proper\nThan any of her lineaments can show her.\nBut, mistress, know yourself; down on your knees,\nAnd thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love.\nFor I must tell you friendly in your ear,\nSell when you can; you are not for all markets.\nCry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;\nFoul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\nSo take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.\n\nPHOEBE.\nSweet youth, I pray you chide a year together!\nI had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\n\nROSALIND.\nHe’s fall’n in love with your foulness, and she’ll fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I’ll sauce her with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?\n\nPHOEBE.\nFor no ill will I bear you.\n\nROSALIND.\nI pray you do not fall in love with me,\nFor I am falser than vows made in wine.\nBesides, I like you not. If you will know my house,\n’Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.\nWill you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.\nCome, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,\nAnd be not proud. Though all the world could see,\nNone could be so abused in sight as he.\nCome, to our flock.\n\n[Exeunt Rosalind, Celia and Corin.]\n\nPHOEBE.\nDead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:\n“Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”\n\nSILVIUS.\nSweet Phoebe—\n\nPHOEBE.\nHa, what sayst thou, Silvius?\n\nSILVIUS.\nSweet Phoebe, pity me.\n\nPHOEBE.\nWhy, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.\n\nSILVIUS.\nWherever sorrow is, relief would be.\nIf you do sorrow at my grief in love,\nBy giving love your sorrow and my grief\nWere both extermined.\n\nPHOEBE.\nThou hast my love. Is not that neighbourly?\n\nSILVIUS.\nI would have you.\n\nPHOEBE.\nWhy, that were covetousness.\nSilvius, the time was that I hated thee;\nAnd yet it is not that I bear thee love;\nBut since that thou canst talk of love so well,\nThy company, which erst was irksome to me,\nI will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.\nBut do not look for further recompense\nThan thine own gladness that thou art employed.\n\nSILVIUS.\nSo holy and so perfect is my love,\nAnd I in such a poverty of grace,\nThat I shall think it a most plenteous crop\nTo glean the broken ears after the man\nThat the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then\nA scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.\n\nPHOEBE.\nKnow’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?\n\nSILVIUS.\nNot very well, but I have met him oft,\nAnd he hath bought the cottage and the bounds\nThat the old carlot once was master of.\n\nPHOEBE.\nThink not I love him, though I ask for him.\n’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well.\nBut what care I for words? Yet words do well\nWhen he that speaks them pleases those that hear.\nIt is a pretty youth—not very pretty—\nBut sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him.\nHe’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him\nIs his complexion; and faster than his tongue\nDid make offence, his eye did heal it up.\nHe is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall;\nHis leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well.\nThere was a pretty redness in his lip,\nA little riper and more lusty red\nThan that mixed in his cheek. ’Twas just the difference\nBetwixt the constant red and mingled damask.\nThere be some women, Silvius, had they marked him\nIn parcels as I did, would have gone near\nTo fall in love with him; but for my part\nI love him not nor hate him not; and yet\nI have more cause to hate him than to love him.\nFor what had he to do to chide at me?\nHe said mine eyes were black and my hair black,\nAnd now I am remembered, scorned at me.\nI marvel why I answered not again.\nBut that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.\nI’ll write to him a very taunting letter,\nAnd thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?\n\nSILVIUS.\nPhoebe, with all my heart.\n\nPHOEBE.\nI’ll write it straight,\nThe matter’s in my head and in my heart.\nI will be bitter with him and passing short.\nGo with me, Silvius.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

The Forest of Arden\nEnter Rosalind, Celia and Jaques.\n\nJAQUES.\nI prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.\n\nROSALIND.\nThey say you are a melancholy fellow.\n\nJAQUES.\nI am so; I do love it better than laughing.\n\nROSALIND.\nThose that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.\n\nJAQUES.\nWhy, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhy then, ’tis good to be a post.\n\nJAQUES.\nI have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.\n\nROSALIND.\nA traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.\n\nJAQUES.\nYes, I have gained my experience.\n\nROSALIND.\nAnd your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too.\n\nEnter Orlando.\n\nORLANDO.\nGood day and happiness, dear Rosalind!\n\nJAQUES.\nNay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.\n\nROSALIND.\nFarewell, Monsieur Traveller. Look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola.\n\n[Exit Jaques.]\n\nWhy, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.\n\nORLANDO.\nMy fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.\n\nROSALIND.\nBreak an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o’ the shoulder, but I’ll warrant him heart-whole.\n\nORLANDO.\nPardon me, dear Rosalind.\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of a snail.\n\nORLANDO.\nOf a snail?\n\nROSALIND.\nAy, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him.\n\nORLANDO.\nWhat’s that?\n\nROSALIND.\nWhy, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.\n\nORLANDO.\nVirtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous.\n\nROSALIND.\nAnd I am your Rosalind.\n\nCELIA.\nIt pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.\n\nROSALIND.\nCome, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?\n\nORLANDO.\nI would kiss before I spoke.\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.\n\nORLANDO.\nHow if the kiss be denied?\n\nROSALIND.\nThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.\n\nORLANDO.\nWho could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\n\nROSALIND.\nMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.\n\nORLANDO.\nWhat, of my suit?\n\nROSALIND.\nNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?\n\nORLANDO.\nI take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.\n\nROSALIND.\nWell, in her person, I say I will not have you.\n\nORLANDO.\nThen, in mine own person, I die.\n\nROSALIND.\nNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp, was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.\n\nORLANDO.\nI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.\n\nROSALIND.\nBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it.\n\nORLANDO.\nThen love me, Rosalind.\n\nROSALIND.\nYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.\n\nORLANDO.\nAnd wilt thou have me?\n\nROSALIND.\nAy, and twenty such.\n\nORLANDO.\nWhat sayest thou?\n\nROSALIND.\nAre you not good?\n\nORLANDO.\nI hope so.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?\n\nORLANDO.\nPray thee, marry us.\n\nCELIA.\nI cannot say the words.\n\nROSALIND.\nYou must begin “Will you, Orlando—”\n\nCELIA.\nGo to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\n\nORLANDO.\nI will.\n\nROSALIND.\nAy, but when?\n\nORLANDO.\nWhy now, as fast as she can marry us.\n\nROSALIND.\nThen you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”\n\nORLANDO.\nI take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\n\nROSALIND.\nI might ask you for your commission. But I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions.\n\nORLANDO.\nSo do all thoughts. They are winged.\n\nROSALIND.\nNow tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.\n\nORLANDO.\nFor ever and a day.\n\nROSALIND.\nSay “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep.\n\nORLANDO.\nBut will my Rosalind do so?\n\nROSALIND.\nBy my life, she will do as I do.\n\nORLANDO.\nO, but she is wise.\n\nROSALIND.\nOr else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.\n\nORLANDO.\nA man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”\n\nROSALIND.\nNay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbour’s bed.\n\nORLANDO.\nAnd what wit could wit have to excuse that?\n\nROSALIND.\nMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.\n\nORLANDO.\nFor these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\n\nROSALIND.\nAlas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.\n\nORLANDO.\nI must attend the Duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee again.\n\nROSALIND.\nAy, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your hour?\n\nORLANDO.\nAy, sweet Rosalind.\n\nROSALIND.\nBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.\n\nORLANDO.\nWith no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.\n\nROSALIND.\nWell, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try. Adieu.\n\n[Exit Orlando.]\n\nCELIA.\nYou have simply misused our sex in your love-prate! We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.\n\nROSALIND.\nO coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.\n\nCELIA.\nOr rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.\n\nROSALIND.\nNo, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.\n\nCELIA.\nAnd I’ll sleep.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

And here much Orlando.\n\nCELIA.\nI warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep.\n\nEnter Silvius.\n\nLook who comes here.\n\nSILVIUS.\nMy errand is to you, fair youth.\nMy gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.\n\n[Giving a letter.]\n\nI know not the contents, but, as I guess\nBy the stern brow and waspish action\nWhich she did use as she was writing of it,\nIt bears an angry tenor. Pardon me,\nI am but as a guiltless messenger.\n\nROSALIND.\nPatience herself would startle at this letter\nAnd play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all!\nShe says I am not fair, that I lack manners;\nShe calls me proud, and that she could not love me,\nWere man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,\nHer love is not the hare that I do hunt.\nWhy writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,\nThis is a letter of your own device.\n\nSILVIUS.\nNo, I protest, I know not the contents.\nPhoebe did write it.\n\nROSALIND.\nCome, come, you are a fool,\nAnd turned into the extremity of love.\nI saw her hand. She has a leathern hand,\nA freestone-coloured hand. I verily did think\nThat her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands.\nShe has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter.\nI say she never did invent this letter;\nThis is a man’s invention, and his hand.\n\nSILVIUS.\nSure, it is hers.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhy, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,\nA style for challengers. Why, she defies me,\nLike Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain\nCould not drop forth such giant-rude invention,\nSuch Ethiop words, blacker in their effect\nThan in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?\n\nSILVIUS.\nSo please you, for I never heard it yet,\nYet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.\n\nROSALIND.\nShe Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.\n\n[Reads.]\n\n            Art thou god to shepherd turned,\n            That a maiden’s heart hath burned?\nCan a woman rail thus?\n\nSILVIUS.\nCall you this railing?\n\nROSALIND.\n            Why, thy godhead laid apart,\n            Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?\nDid you ever hear such railing?\n            Whiles the eye of man did woo me,\n            That could do no vengeance to me.\nMeaning me a beast.\n            If the scorn of your bright eyne\n            Have power to raise such love in mine,\n            Alack, in me what strange effect\n            Would they work in mild aspect?\n            Whiles you chid me, I did love,\n            How then might your prayers move?\n            He that brings this love to thee\n            Little knows this love in me;\n            And by him seal up thy mind,\n            Whether that thy youth and kind\n            Will the faithful offer take\n            Of me, and all that I can make,\n            Or else by him my love deny,\n            And then I’ll study how to die.\n\nSILVIUS.\nCall you this chiding?\n\nCELIA.\nAlas, poor shepherd.\n\nROSALIND.\nDo you pity him? No, he deserves no pity.—Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word, for here comes more company.\n\n[Exit Silvius.]\n\nEnter Oliver.\n\nOLIVER.\nGood morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know,\nWhere in the purlieus of this forest stands\nA sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?\n\nCELIA.\nWest of this place, down in the neighbour bottom;\nThe rank of osiers, by the murmuring stream,\nLeft on your right hand, brings you to the place.\nBut at this hour the house doth keep itself.\nThere’s none within.\n\nOLIVER.\nIf that an eye may profit by a tongue,\nThen should I know you by description,\nSuch garments, and such years. “The boy is fair,\nOf female favour, and bestows himself\nLike a ripe sister; the woman low,\nAnd browner than her brother.” Are not you\nThe owner of the house I did inquire for?\n\nCELIA.\nIt is no boast, being asked, to say we are.\n\nOLIVER.\nOrlando doth commend him to you both,\nAnd to that youth he calls his Rosalind\nHe sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?\n\nROSALIND.\nI am. What must we understand by this?\n\nOLIVER.\nSome of my shame, if you will know of me\nWhat man I am, and how, and why, and where\nThis handkerchief was stained.\n\nCELIA.\nI pray you tell it.\n\nOLIVER.\nWhen last the young Orlando parted from you,\nHe left a promise to return again\nWithin an hour, and pacing through the forest,\nChewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,\nLo, what befell. He threw his eye aside,\nAnd mark what object did present itself.\nUnder an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age\nAnd high top bald with dry antiquity,\nA wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,\nLay sleeping on his back; about his neck\nA green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,\nWho with her head, nimble in threats, approached\nThe opening of his mouth. But suddenly,\nSeeing Orlando, it unlinked itself\nAnd with indented glides did slip away\nInto a bush; under which bush’s shade\nA lioness, with udders all drawn dry,\nLay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch\nWhen that the sleeping man should stir. For ’tis\nThe royal disposition of that beast\nTo prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.\nThis seen, Orlando did approach the man\nAnd found it was his brother, his elder brother.\n\nCELIA.\nO, I have heard him speak of that same brother,\nAnd he did render him the most unnatural\nThat lived amongst men.\n\nOLIVER.\nAnd well he might so do,\nFor well I know he was unnatural.\n\nROSALIND.\nBut, to Orlando: did he leave him there,\nFood to the sucked and hungry lioness?\n\nOLIVER.\nTwice did he turn his back and purposed so;\nBut kindness, nobler ever than revenge,\nAnd nature, stronger than his just occasion,\nMade him give battle to the lioness,\nWho quickly fell before him; in which hurtling\nFrom miserable slumber I awaked.\n\nCELIA.\nAre you his brother?\n\nROSALIND.\nWas it you he rescued?\n\nCELIA.\nWas’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?\n\nOLIVER.\n’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame\nTo tell you what I was, since my conversion\nSo sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.\n\nROSALIND.\nBut, for the bloody napkin?\n\nOLIVER.\nBy and by.\nWhen from the first to last betwixt us two\nTears our recountments had most kindly bathed—\nAs how I came into that desert place—\nIn brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,\nWho gave me fresh array and entertainment,\nCommitting me unto my brother’s love,\nWho led me instantly unto his cave,\nThere stripped himself, and here upon his arm\nThe lioness had torn some flesh away,\nWhich all this while had bled; and now he fainted,\nAnd cried in fainting upon Rosalind.\nBrief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,\nAnd after some small space, being strong at heart,\nHe sent me hither, stranger as I am,\nTo tell this story, that you might excuse\nHis broken promise, and to give this napkin,\nDyed in his blood, unto the shepherd youth\nThat he in sport doth call his Rosalind.\n\n[Rosalind faints.]\n\nCELIA.\nWhy, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede!\n\nOLIVER.\nMany will swoon when they do look on blood.\n\nCELIA.\nThere is more in it. Cousin—Ganymede!\n\nOLIVER.\nLook, he recovers.\n\nROSALIND.\nI would I were at home.\n\nCELIA.\nWe’ll lead you thither.\nI pray you, will you take him by the arm?\n\nOLIVER.\nBe of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.\n\nROSALIND.\nI do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho.\n\nOLIVER.\nThis was not counterfeit. There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.\n\nROSALIND.\nCounterfeit, I assure you.\n\nOLIVER.\nWell then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man.\n\nROSALIND.\nSo I do. But, i’ faith, I should have been a woman by right.\n\nCELIA.\nCome, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.\n\nOLIVER.\nThat will I, for I must bear answer back\nHow you excuse my brother, Rosalind.\n\nROSALIND.\nI shall devise something. But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?\n\n[Exeunt.]",

But say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.\n\nEnter Rosalind.\n\nORLANDO.\nYou have my consent. Let your wedding be tomorrow. Thither will I invite the Duke and all’s contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.\n\nROSALIND.\nGod save you, brother.\n\nOLIVER.\nAnd you, fair sister.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nROSALIND.\nO my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf!\n\nORLANDO.\nIt is my arm.\n\nROSALIND.\nI thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.\n\nORLANDO.\nWounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.\n\nROSALIND.\nDid your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher?\n\nORLANDO.\nAy, and greater wonders than that.\n\nROSALIND.\nO, I know where you are. Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of “I came, saw and overcame.” For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy; and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.\n\nORLANDO.\nThey shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes! By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.\n\nROSALIND.\nWhy, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?\n\nORLANDO.\nI can live no longer by thinking.\n\nROSALIND.\nI will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then—for now I speak to some purpose—that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.\n\nORLANDO.\nSpeak’st thou in sober meanings?\n\nROSALIND.\nBy my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician.

A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nBy my faith, he is very swift and sententious.\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nAccording to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.\n\nJAQUES.\nBut, for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nUpon a lie seven times removed—bear your body more seeming, Audrey—as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called the “retort courteous”. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is called the “quip modest”. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgement. This is called the “reply churlish”. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called the “reproof valiant”. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is called the “countercheck quarrelsome”, and so, to the “lie circumstantial”, and the “lie direct”.\n\nJAQUES.\nAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nI durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct; and so we measured swords and parted.\n\nJAQUES.\nCan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\n\nTOUCHSTONE.\nO sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the second, the quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance; the seventh, the lie direct. All these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an “if”. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an “if”, as, “if you said so, then I said so;” and they shook hands, and swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker; much virtue in “if.”\n\nJAQUES.\nIs not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at anything, and yet a fool.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nHe uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.\n\nEnter Hymen, Rosalind in woman’s clothes, and Celia. Still music.\n\nHYMEN.\n    Then is there mirth in heaven\n    When earthly things made even\n        Atone together.\n    Good Duke, receive thy daughter.\n    Hymen from heaven brought her,\n        Yea, brought her hither,\n    That thou mightst join her hand with his,\n    Whose heart within his bosom is.\n\nROSALIND.\n[To Duke Senior.] To you I give myself, for I am yours.\n[To Orlando.] To you I give myself, for I am yours.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nIf there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.\n\nORLANDO.\nIf there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.\n\nPHOEBE.\nIf sight and shape be true,\nWhy then, my love adieu.\n\nROSALIND.\n[To Duke Senior.] I’ll have no father, if you be not he.\n[To Orlando.] I’ll have no husband, if you be not he.\n[To Phoebe.] Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.\n\nHYMEN.\n    Peace, ho! I bar confusion.\n    ’Tis I must make conclusion\n        Of these most strange events.\n    Here’s eight that must take hands\n    To join in Hymen’s bands,\n        If truth holds true contents.\n[To Orlando and Rosalind.] You and you no cross shall part.\n[To Celia and Oliver.] You and you are heart in heart.\n[To Phoebe.] You to his love must accord\nOr have a woman to your lord.\n[To Audrey and Touchstone.] You and you are sure together\nAs the winter to foul weather.\nWhiles a wedlock hymn we sing,\nFeed yourselves with questioning,\nThat reason wonder may diminish\nHow thus we met, and these things finish.\n\n                        SONG\n      Wedding is great Juno’s crown,\n            O blessed bond of board and bed.\n      ’Tis Hymen peoples every town,\n            High wedlock then be honoured.\n      Honour, high honour, and renown\n      To Hymen, god of every town.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nO my dear niece, welcome thou art to me\nEven daughter, welcome in no less degree.\n\nPHOEBE.\n[To Silvius.] I will not eat my word, now thou art mine,\nThy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.\n\nEnter Jaques de Boys.\n\nJAQUES DE BOYS.\nLet me have audience for a word or two.\nI am the second son of old Sir Rowland,\nThat bring these tidings to this fair assembly.\nDuke Frederick, hearing how that every day\nMen of great worth resorted to this forest,\nAddressed a mighty power, which were on foot\nIn his own conduct, purposely to take\nHis brother here and put him to the sword;\nAnd to the skirts of this wild wood he came,\nWhere, meeting with an old religious man,\nAfter some question with him, was converted\nBoth from his enterprise and from the world,\nHis crown bequeathing to his banished brother,\nAnd all their lands restored to them again\nThat were with him exiled. This to be true\nI do engage my life.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nWelcome, young man.\nThou offer’st fairly to thy brother’s wedding:\nTo one his lands withheld, and to the other\nA land itself at large, a potent dukedom.\nFirst, in this forest let us do those ends\nThat here were well begun and well begot;\nAnd after, every of this happy number\nThat have endured shrewd days and nights with us\nShall share the good of our returned fortune,\nAccording to the measure of their states.\nMeantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity,\nAnd fall into our rustic revelry.\nPlay, music! And you brides and bridegrooms all,\nWith measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.\n\nJAQUES.\nSir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,\nThe Duke hath put on a religious life\nAnd thrown into neglect the pompous court.\n\nJAQUES DE BOYS.\nHe hath.\n\nJAQUES.\nTo him will I. Out of these convertites\nThere is much matter to be heard and learned.\n[To Duke Senior.] You to your former honour I bequeath;\nYour patience and your virtue well deserves it.\n[To Orlando.] You to a love that your true faith doth merit.\n[To Oliver.] You to your land, and love, and great allies.\n[To Silvius.] You to a long and well-deserved bed.\n[To Touchstone.] And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage\nIs but for two months victualled.—So to your pleasures,\nI am for other than for dancing measures.\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nStay, Jaques, stay.\n\nJAQUES.\nTo see no pastime, I. What you would have\nI’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDUKE SENIOR.\nProceed, proceed! We will begin these rites,\nAs we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.\n\n[Dance. Exeunt all but Rosalind.]",

    "content":"EPILOGUE\nROSALIND.\nIt is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates them—that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.\n\n[Exit.]",
