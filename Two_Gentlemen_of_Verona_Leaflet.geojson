    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Verona. An open place\nEnter Valentine and Proteus.\n\nVALENTINE.\nCease to persuade, my loving Proteus.\nHome-keeping youth have ever homely wits.\nWere’t not affection chains thy tender days\nTo the sweet glances of thy honoured love,\nI rather would entreat thy company\nTo see the wonders of the world abroad\nThan, living dully sluggardized at home,\nWear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.\nBut since thou lov’st, love still, and thrive therein,\nEven as I would when I to love begin.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu.\nThink on thy Proteus when thou haply seest\nSome rare noteworthy object in thy travel.\nWish me partaker in thy happiness\nWhen thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,\nIf ever danger do environ thee,\nCommend thy grievance to my holy prayers,\nFor I will be thy headsman, Valentine.\n\nVALENTINE.\nAnd on a love-book pray for my success?\n\nPROTEUS.\nUpon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.\n\nVALENTINE.\nThat’s on some shallow story of deep love,\nHow young Leander crossed the Hellespont.\n\nPROTEUS.\nThat’s a deep story of a deeper love,\nFor he was more than over shoes in love.\n\nVALENTINE.\n’Tis true; for you are over boots in love,\nAnd yet you never swam the Hellespont.\n\nPROTEUS.\nOver the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.\n\nVALENTINE.\nNo, I will not, for it boots thee not.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhat?\n\nVALENTINE.\nTo be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,\nCoy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment’s mirth\nWith twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights.\nIf haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;\nIf lost, why then a grievous labour won;\nHowever, but a folly bought with wit,\nOr else a wit by folly vanquished.\n\nPROTEUS.\nSo, by your circumstance, you call me fool.\n\nVALENTINE.\nSo, by your circumstance, I fear you’ll prove.\n\nPROTEUS.\n’Tis love you cavil at. I am not Love.\n\nVALENTINE.\nLove is your master, for he masters you;\nAnd he that is so yoked by a fool\nMethinks should not be chronicled for wise.\n\nPROTEUS.\nYet writers say, as in the sweetest bud\nThe eating canker dwells, so eating love\nInhabits in the finest wits of all.\n\nVALENTINE.\nAnd writers say, as the most forward bud\nIs eaten by the canker ere it blow,\nEven so by love the young and tender wit\nIs turned to folly, blasting in the bud,\nLosing his verdure even in the prime,\nAnd all the fair effects of future hopes.\nBut wherefore waste I time to counsel thee\nThat art a votary to fond desire?\nOnce more adieu. My father at the road\nExpects my coming, there to see me shipped.\n\nPROTEUS.\nAnd thither will I bring thee, Valentine.\n\nVALENTINE.\nSweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave.\nTo Milan let me hear from thee by letters\nOf thy success in love, and what news else\nBetideth here in absence of thy friend;\nAnd I likewise will visit thee with mine.\n\nPROTEUS.\nAll happiness bechance to thee in Milan.\n\nVALENTINE.\nAs much to you at home, and so farewell.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPROTEUS.\nHe after honour hunts, I after love.\nHe leaves his friends to dignify them more;\nI leave myself, my friends, and all for love.\nThou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,\nMade me neglect my studies, lose my time,\nWar with good counsel, set the world at nought;\nMade wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.\n\nEnter Speed.\n\nSPEED.\nSir Proteus, ’save you. Saw you my master?\n\nPROTEUS.\nBut now he parted hence to embark for Milan.\n\nSPEED.\nTwenty to one, then, he is shipped already,\nAnd I have played the sheep in losing him.\n\nPROTEUS.\nIndeed a sheep doth very often stray,\nAn if the shepherd be a while away.\n\nSPEED.\nYou conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and I a sheep?\n\nPROTEUS.\nI do.\n\nSPEED.\nWhy then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.\n\nPROTEUS.\nA silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.\n\nSPEED.\nThis proves me still a sheep.\n\nPROTEUS.\nTrue, and thy master a shepherd.\n\nSPEED.\nNay, that I can deny by a circumstance.\n\nPROTEUS.\nIt shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.\n\nSPEED.\nThe shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me. Therefore I am no sheep.\n\nPROTEUS.\nThe sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for food follows not the sheep. Thou for wages followest thy master; thy master for wages follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.\n\nSPEED.\nSuch another proof will make me cry “baa”.\n\nPROTEUS.\nBut dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to Julia?\n\nSPEED.\nAy, sir. I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing for my labour.\n\nPROTEUS.\nHere’s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.\n\nSPEED.\nIf the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.\n\nPROTEUS.\nNay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound you.\n\nSPEED.\nNay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.\n\nPROTEUS.\nYou mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.\n\nSPEED.\nFrom a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,\n’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.\n\nPROTEUS.\nBut what said she?\n\nSPEED.\n[Nods his head.] Ay.\n\nPROTEUS.\nNod—“Ay”. Why, that’s “noddy”.\n\nSPEED.\nYou mistook, sir. I say she did nod, and you ask me if she did nod; and I say “Ay”.\n\nPROTEUS.\nAnd that set together is “noddy”.\n\nSPEED.\nNow you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.\n\nPROTEUS.\nNo, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.\n\nSPEED.\nWell, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhy, sir, how do you bear with me?\n\nSPEED.\nMarry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word “noddy” for my pains.\n\nPROTEUS.\nBeshrew me, but you have a quick wit.\n\nSPEED.\nAnd yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.\n\nPROTEUS.\nCome, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?\n\nSPEED.\nOpen your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered.\n\nPROTEUS.\n[Giving him a coin.] Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?\n\nSPEED.\nTruly, sir, I think you’ll hardly win her.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhy? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?\n\nSPEED.\nSir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter. And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she’s as hard as steel.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhat said she, nothing?\n\nSPEED.\nNo, not so much as “Take this for thy pains.” To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, I’ll commend you to my master.\n\nPROTEUS.\nGo, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack,\nWhich cannot perish having thee aboard,\nBeing destined to a drier death on shore.\n\n[Exit Speed.]\n\nI must go send some better messenger.\nI fear my Julia would not deign my lines,\nReceiving them from such a worthless post.\n\n[Exit.]",

What means this passion at his name?\n\nLUCETTA.\nPardon, dear madam, ’tis a passing shame\nThat I, unworthy body as I am,\nShould censure thus on lovely gentlemen.\n\nJULIA.\nWhy not on Proteus, as of all the rest?\n\nLUCETTA.\nThen thus: of many good I think him best.\n\nJULIA.\nYour reason?\n\nLUCETTA.\nI have no other but a woman’s reason:\nI think him so because I think him so.\n\nJULIA.\nAnd wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?\n\nLUCETTA.\nAy, if you thought your love not cast away.\n\nJULIA.\nWhy, he of all the rest hath never moved me.\n\nLUCETTA.\nYet he of all the rest I think best loves ye.\n\nJULIA.\nHis little speaking shows his love but small.\n\nLUCETTA.\nFire that’s closest kept burns most of all.\n\nJULIA.\nThey do not love that do not show their love.\n\nLUCETTA.\nO, they love least that let men know their love.\n\nJULIA.\nI would I knew his mind.\n\nLUCETTA.\nPeruse this paper, madam.\n\n[Gives her a letter.]\n\nJULIA.\nTo Julia—Say, from whom?\n\nLUCETTA.\nThat the contents will show.\n\nJULIA.\nSay, say, who gave it thee?\n\nLUCETTA.\nSir Valentine’s page, and sent, I think, from Proteus.\nHe would have given it you, but I, being in the way,\nDid in your name receive it. Pardon the fault, I pray.\n\nJULIA.\nNow, by my modesty, a goodly broker!\nDare you presume to harbour wanton lines?\nTo whisper and conspire against my youth?\nNow trust me, ’tis an office of great worth,\nAnd you an officer fit for the place.\nThere, take the paper; see it be returned,\nOr else return no more into my sight.\n\nLUCETTA.\nTo plead for love deserves more fee than hate.\n\nJULIA.\nWill ye be gone?\n\nLUCETTA.\nThat you may ruminate.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nJULIA.\nAnd yet I would I had o’erlooked the letter.\nIt were a shame to call her back again\nAnd pray her to a fault for which I chid her.\nWhat fool is she, that knows I am a maid\nAnd would not force the letter to my view,\nSince maids in modesty say “No” to that\nWhich they would have the profferer construe “Ay”.\nFie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love\nThat like a testy babe will scratch the nurse\nAnd presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!\nHow churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,\nWhen willingly I would have had her here!\nHow angerly I taught my brow to frown,\nWhen inward joy enforced my heart to smile!\nMy penance is to call Lucetta back\nAnd ask remission for my folly past.\nWhat ho! Lucetta!\n\nEnter Lucetta.\n\nLUCETTA.\nWhat would your ladyship?\n\nJULIA.\nIs ’t near dinner time?\n\nLUCETTA.\nI would it were,\nThat you might kill your stomach on your meat\nAnd not upon your maid.\n\n[Drops and picks up the letter.]\n\nJULIA.\nWhat is’t that you took up so gingerly?\n\nLUCETTA.\nNothing.\n\nJULIA.\nWhy didst thou stoop, then?\n\nLUCETTA.\nTo take a paper up that I let fall.\n\nJULIA.\nAnd is that paper nothing?\n\nLUCETTA.\nNothing concerning me.\n\nJULIA.\nThen let it lie for those that it concerns.\n\nLUCETTA.\nMadam, it will not lie where it concerns,\nUnless it have a false interpreter.\n\nJULIA.\nSome love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.\n\nLUCETTA.\nThat I might sing it, madam, to a tune.\nGive me a note. Your ladyship can set—\n\nJULIA.\nAs little by such toys as may be possible.\nBest sing it to the tune of “Light o’ Love”.\n\nLUCETTA.\nIt is too heavy for so light a tune.\n\nJULIA.\nHeavy?

Unkind Julia!\nAs in revenge of thy ingratitude,\nI throw thy name against the bruising stones,\nTrampling contemptuously on thy disdain.\nAnd here is writ love-wounded Proteus.\nPoor wounded name, my bosom as a bed\nShall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed;\nAnd thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.\nBut twice or thrice was Proteus written down.\nBe calm, good wind, blow not a word away\nTill I have found each letter in the letter\nExcept mine own name. That some whirlwind bear\nUnto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,\nAnd throw it thence into the raging sea.\nLo, here in one line is his name twice writ:\nPoor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,\nTo the sweet Julia. That I’ll tear away;\nAnd yet I will not, sith so prettily\nHe couples it to his complaining names.\nThus will I fold them one upon another.\nNow kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.\n\nEnter Lucetta.\n\nLUCETTA.\nMadam, dinner is ready, and your father stays.\n\nJULIA.\nWell, let us go.\n\nLUCETTA.\nWhat, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?\n\nJULIA.\nIf you respect them, best to take them up.\n\nLUCETTA.\nNay, I was taken up for laying them down.\nYet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.\n\n[Picks up pieces of the letter.]\n\nJULIA.\nI see you have a month’s mind to them.\n\nLUCETTA.\nAy, madam, you may say what sights you see;\nI see things too, although you judge I wink.\n\nJULIA.\nCome, come, will’t please you go?\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Ay, give it me, it’s mine.\nSweet ornament that decks a thing divine!\nAh, Silvia, Silvia!\n\nSPEED.\n[Calling.] Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!\n\nVALENTINE.\nHow now, sirrah?\n\nSPEED.\nShe is not within hearing, sir.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy, sir, who bade you call her?\n\nSPEED.\nYour worship, sir, or else I mistook.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWell, you’ll still be too forward.\n\nSPEED.\nAnd yet I was last chidden for being too slow.\n\nVALENTINE.\nGo to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?\n\nSPEED.\nShe that your worship loves?\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy, how know you that I am in love?\n\nSPEED.\nMarry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms like a malcontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his ABC; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money. And now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.\n\nVALENTINE.\nAre all these things perceived in me?\n\nSPEED.\nThey are all perceived without ye.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWithout me? They cannot.\n\nSPEED.\nWithout you? Nay, that’s certain, for without you were so simple, none else would. But you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you, and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.\n\nVALENTINE.\nBut tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?\n\nSPEED.\nShe that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?\n\nVALENTINE.\nHast thou observed that?

And how out of count?\n\nSPEED.\nMarry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.\n\nVALENTINE.\nHow esteem’st thou me? I account of her beauty.\n\nSPEED.\nYou never saw her since she was deformed.\n\nVALENTINE.\nHow long hath she been deformed?\n\nSPEED.\nEver since you loved her.\n\nVALENTINE.\nI have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.\n\nSPEED.\nIf you love her, you cannot see her.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy?\n\nSPEED.\nBecause Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhat should I see then?\n\nSPEED.\nYour own present folly and her passing deformity; for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.\n\nVALENTINE.\nBelike, boy, then you are in love, for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.\n\nSPEED.\nTrue, sir, I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.\n\nVALENTINE.\nIn conclusion, I stand affected to her.\n\nSPEED.\nI would you were set, so your affection would cease.\n\nVALENTINE.\nLast night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves.\n\nSPEED.\nAnd have you?\n\nVALENTINE.\nI have.\n\nSPEED.\nAre they not lamely writ?\n\nVALENTINE.\nNo, boy, but as well as I can do them.\nPeace, here she comes.\n\nEnter Silvia.\n\nSPEED.\n[Aside.] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!\nNow will he interpret to her.\n\nVALENTINE.\nMadam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.\n\nSPEED.\n[Aside.] O, give ye good e’en! Here’s a million of manners.\n\nSILVIA.\nSir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.\n\nSPEED.\n[Aside.] He should give her interest, and she gives it him.\n\nVALENTINE.\nAs you enjoined me, I have writ your letter\nUnto the secret nameless friend of yours,\nWhich I was much unwilling to proceed in\nBut for my duty to your ladyship.\n\n[Gives her a letter.]\n\nSILVIA.\nI thank you, gentle servant, ’tis very clerkly done.\n\nVALENTINE.\nNow trust me, madam, it came hardly off,\nFor, being ignorant to whom it goes,\nI writ at random, very doubtfully.\n\nSILVIA.\nPerchance you think too much of so much pains?\n\nVALENTINE.\nNo, madam; so it stead you, I will write,\nPlease you command, a thousand times as much.\nAnd yet—\n\nSILVIA.\nA pretty period.

Do you not like it?\n\nSILVIA.\nYes, yes, the lines are very quaintly writ,\nBut, since unwillingly, take them again.\nNay, take them.\n\n[Offers the letter again.]\n\nVALENTINE.\nMadam, they are for you.\n\nSILVIA.\nAy, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request,\nBut I will none of them. They are for you.\nI would have had them writ more movingly.\n\nVALENTINE.\nPlease you, I’ll write your ladyship another.\n\nSILVIA.\nAnd when it’s writ, for my sake read it over,\nAnd if it please you, so; if not, why, so.\n\nVALENTINE.\nIf it please me, madam? What then?\n\nSILVIA.\nWhy, if it please you, take it for your labour.\nAnd so good morrow, servant.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nSPEED.\n[Aside.] O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,\nAs a nose on a man’s face, or a weathercock on a steeple!\nMy master sues to her, and she hath taught her suitor,\nHe being her pupil, to become her tutor.\nO excellent device! Was there ever heard a better?\nThat my master, being scribe, to himself should write the letter?\n\nVALENTINE.\nHow now, sir? What are you reasoning with yourself?\n\nSPEED.\nNay, I was rhyming. ’Tis you that have the reason.\n\nVALENTINE.\nTo do what?\n\nSPEED.\nTo be a spokesman from Madam Silvia.\n\nVALENTINE.\nTo whom?\n\nSPEED.\nTo yourself. Why, she woos you by a figure.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhat figure?\n\nSPEED.\nBy a letter, I should say.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy, she hath not writ to me.\n\nSPEED.\nWhat need she, when she hath made you write to yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?\n\nVALENTINE.\nNo, believe me.\n\nSPEED.\nNo believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her earnest?\n\nVALENTINE.\nShe gave me none, except an angry word.\n\nSPEED.\nWhy, she hath given you a letter.\n\nVALENTINE.\nThat’s the letter I writ to her friend.\n\nSPEED.\nAnd that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.\n\nVALENTINE.\nI would it were no worse.\n\nSPEED.\nI’ll warrant you, ’tis as well.\nFor often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty\nOr else for want of idle time, could not again reply,\nOr fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,\nHerself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.\nAll this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you, sir? ’Tis dinner time.\n\nVALENTINE.\nI have dined.\n\nSPEED.\nAy, but hearken, sir, though the chameleon Love can feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like your mistress! Be moved, be moved.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

He is a stone, a very pebblestone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting. Why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I’ll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father. No, this left shoe is my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother. Nay, that cannot be so neither. Yes, it is so, it is so; it hath the worser sole. This shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A vengeance on ’t, there ’tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog. No, the dog is himself, and I am the dog. O, the dog is me, and I am myself. Ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: “Father, your blessing.” Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping. Now should I kiss my father. Well, he weeps on.

Why, man, she is mine own,\nAnd I as rich in having such a jewel\nAs twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,\nThe water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.\nForgive me that I do not dream on thee,\nBecause thou seest me dote upon my love.\nMy foolish rival, that her father likes\nOnly for his possessions are so huge,\nIs gone with her along, and I must after,\nFor love, thou know’st, is full of jealousy.\n\nPROTEUS.\nBut she loves you?\n\nVALENTINE.\nAy, and we are betrothed; nay more, our marriage hour,\nWith all the cunning manner of our flight,\nDetermined of: how I must climb her window,\nThe ladder made of cords, and all the means\nPlotted and ’greed on for my happiness.\nGood Proteus, go with me to my chamber,\nIn these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.\n\nPROTEUS.\nGo on before; I shall enquire you forth.\nI must unto the road to disembark\nSome necessaries that I needs must use,\nAnd then I’ll presently attend you.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWill you make haste?\n\nPROTEUS.\nI will.\n\n[Exit Valentine.]\n\nEven as one heat another heat expels,\nOr as one nail by strength drives out another,\nSo the remembrance of my former love\nIs by a newer object quite forgotten.\nIs it mine eye, or Valentine’s praise,\nHer true perfection, or my false transgression,\nThat makes me reasonless to reason thus?\nShe is fair; and so is Julia that I love—\nThat I did love, for now my love is thawed,\nWhich like a waxen image ’gainst a fire\nBears no impression of the thing it was.\nMethinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,\nAnd that I love him not as I was wont.\nO, but I love his lady too too much,\nAnd that’s the reason I love him so little.\nHow shall I dote on her with more advice\nThat thus without advice begin to love her?\n’Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,\nAnd that hath dazzled my reason’s light;\nBut when I look on her perfections,\nThere is no reason but I shall be blind.\nIf I can check my erring love, I will;\nIf not, to compass her I’ll use my skill.\n\n[Exit.]",

An anteroom in the Duke’s palace\nEnter Duke, Thurio and Proteus.\n\nDUKE.\nSir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;\nWe have some secrets to confer about.\n\n[Exit Thurio.]\n\nNow tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?\n\nPROTEUS.\nMy gracious lord, that which I would discover\nThe law of friendship bids me to conceal,\nBut when I call to mind your gracious favours\nDone to me, undeserving as I am,\nMy duty pricks me on to utter that\nWhich else no worldly good should draw from me.\nKnow, worthy prince, Sir Valentine my friend\nThis night intends to steal away your daughter;\nMyself am one made privy to the plot.\nI know you have determined to bestow her\nOn Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,\nAnd should she thus be stol’n away from you,\nIt would be much vexation to your age.\nThus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose\nTo cross my friend in his intended drift\nThan, by concealing it, heap on your head\nA pack of sorrows which would press you down,\nBeing unprevented, to your timeless grave.\n\nDUKE.\nProteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,\nWhich to requite command me while I live.\nThis love of theirs myself have often seen,\nHaply when they have judged me fast asleep,\nAnd oftentimes have purposed to forbid\nSir Valentine her company and my court.\nBut fearing lest my jealous aim might err\nAnd so, unworthily, disgrace the man—\nA rashness that I ever yet have shunned—\nI gave him gentle looks, thereby to find\nThat which thyself hast now disclosed to me.\nAnd that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,\nKnowing that tender youth is soon suggested,\nI nightly lodge her in an upper tower,\nThe key whereof myself have ever kept;\nAnd thence she cannot be conveyed away.\n\nPROTEUS.\nKnow, noble lord, they have devised a mean\nHow he her chamber-window will ascend\nAnd with a corded ladder fetch her down;\nFor which the youthful lover now is gone,\nAnd this way comes he with it presently,\nWhere, if it please you, you may intercept him.\nBut, good my lord, do it so cunningly\nThat my discovery be not aimed at;\nFor love of you, not hate unto my friend,\nHath made me publisher of this pretence.\n\nDUKE.\nUpon mine honour, he shall never know\nThat I had any light from thee of this.\n\nPROTEUS.\nAdieu, my lord, Sir Valentine is coming.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Valentine.\n\nDUKE.\nSir Valentine, whither away so fast?\n\nVALENTINE.\nPlease it your Grace, there is a messenger\nThat stays to bear my letters to my friends,\nAnd I am going to deliver them.\n\nDUKE.\nBe they of much import?\n\nVALENTINE.\nThe tenor of them doth but signify\nMy health and happy being at your court.\n\nDUKE.\nNay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile;\nI am to break with thee of some affairs\nThat touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.\n’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought\nTo match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.\n\nVALENTINE.\nI know it well, my lord, and sure the match\nWere rich and honourable. Besides, the gentleman\nIs full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities\nBeseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.\nCannot your grace win her to fancy him?\n\nDUKE.\nNo, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,\nProud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,\nNeither regarding that she is my child\nNor fearing me as if I were her father;\nAnd, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,\nUpon advice, hath drawn my love from her,\nAnd where I thought the remnant of mine age\nShould have been cherished by her childlike duty,\nI now am full resolved to take a wife\nAnd turn her out to who will take her in.\nThen let her beauty be her wedding dower,\nFor me and my possessions she esteems not.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhat would your Grace have me to do in this?\n\nDUKE.\nThere is a lady of Verona here\nWhom I affect; but she is nice, and coy,\nAnd nought esteems my aged eloquence.\nNow therefore would I have thee to my tutor—\nFor long agone I have forgot to court;\nBesides, the fashion of the time is changed—\nHow and which way I may bestow myself\nTo be regarded in her sun-bright eye.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWin her with gifts if she respect not words;\nDumb jewels often in their silent kind\nMore than quick words do move a woman’s mind.\n\nDUKE.\nBut she did scorn a present that I sent her.\n\nVALENTINE.\nA woman sometime scorns what best contents her.\nSend her another; never give her o’er,\nFor scorn at first makes after-love the more.\nIf she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you,\nBut rather to beget more love in you.\nIf she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone,\nForwhy the fools are mad if left alone.\nTake no repulse, whatever she doth say;\nFor “Get you gone” she doth not mean “Away!”\nFlatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;\nThough ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces.\nThat man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man\nIf with his tongue he cannot win a woman.\n\nDUKE.\nBut she I mean is promised by her friends\nUnto a youthful gentleman of worth,\nAnd kept severely from resort of men,\nThat no man hath access by day to her.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy then, I would resort to her by night.\n\nDUKE.\nAy, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,\nThat no man hath recourse to her by night.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhat lets but one may enter at her window?\n\nDUKE.\nHer chamber is aloft, far from the ground,\nAnd built so shelving that one cannot climb it\nWithout apparent hazard of his life.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy, then a ladder quaintly made of cords\nTo cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks,\nWould serve to scale another Hero’s tower,\nSo bold Leander would adventure it.\n\nDUKE.\nNow, as thou art a gentleman of blood,\nAdvise me where I may have such a ladder.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhen would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.\n\nDUKE.\nThis very night; for Love is like a child\nThat longs for everything that he can come by.\n\nVALENTINE.\nBy seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder.\n\nDUKE.\nBut, hark thee: I will go to her alone;\nHow shall I best convey the ladder thither?\n\nVALENTINE.\nIt will be light, my lord, that you may bear it\nUnder a cloak that is of any length.\n\nDUKE.\nA cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?\n\nVALENTINE.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nDUKE.\nThen let me see thy cloak;\nI’ll get me one of such another length.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nHow shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?\nI pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.\n\n[Takes Valentine’s cloak and finds a letter and a rope ladder concealed under it.]\n\nWhat letter is this same? What’s here?—To Silvia?\nAnd here an engine fit for my proceeding.\nI’ll be so bold to break the seal for once.\n\n[Reads.] My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,\n    And slaves they are to me that send them flying.\nO, could their master come and go as lightly,\n    Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are lying.\nMy herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,\n    While I, their king, that thither them importune,\nDo curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,\n    Because myself do want my servants’ fortune.\nI curse myself, for they are sent by me,\nThat they should harbour where their lord should be.\nWhat’s here?\n[Reads.] Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.\n’Tis so; and here’s the ladder for the purpose.\nWhy, Phaëthon—for thou art Merops’ son—\nWilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,\nAnd with thy daring folly burn the world?\nWilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee?\nGo, base intruder, overweening slave,\nBestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,\nAnd think my patience, more than thy desert,\nIs privilege for thy departure hence.\nThank me for this more than for all the favours\nWhich, all too much, I have bestowed on thee.\nBut if thou linger in my territories\nLonger than swiftest expedition\nWill give thee time to leave our royal court,\nBy heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love\nI ever bore my daughter or thyself.\nBegone, I will not hear thy vain excuse,\nBut, as thou lov’st thy life, make speed from hence.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nVALENTINE.\nAnd why not death, rather than living torment?\nTo die is to be banished from myself,\nAnd Silvia is myself; banished from her\nIs self from self—a deadly banishment.\nWhat light is light, if Silvia be not seen?\nWhat joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?\nUnless it be to think that she is by\nAnd feed upon the shadow of perfection.\nExcept I be by Silvia in the night,\nThere is no music in the nightingale.\nUnless I look on Silvia in the day,\nThere is no day for me to look upon.\nShe is my essence, and I leave to be\nIf I be not by her fair influence\nFostered, illumined, cherished, kept alive.\nI fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:\nTarry I here, I but attend on death,\nBut fly I hence, I fly away from life.\n\nEnter Proteus and Lance.\n\nPROTEUS.\nRun, boy, run, run, seek him out.\n\nLANCE.\nSo-ho, so-ho!\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhat seest thou?\n\nLANCE.\nHim we go to find.

Come, Valentine.\n\nVALENTINE.\nO, my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!\n\n[Exeunt Valentine and Proteus.]\n\nLANCE.\nI am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave; but that’s all one if he be but one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who ’tis I love; and yet ’tis a woman, but what woman I will not tell myself; and yet ’tis a milkmaid; yet ’tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet ’tis a maid, for she is her master’s maid and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel, which is much in a bare Christian. [Pulls out a paper.] Here is the cate-log of her condition. Imprimis, She can fetch and carry. Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch but only carry; therefore is she better than a jade. Item, She can milk. Look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands.\n\nEnter Speed.\n\nSPEED.\nHow now, Signior Lance? What news with your mastership?\n\nLANCE.\nWith my master’s ship? Why, it is at sea.\n\nSPEED.\nWell, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news, then, in your paper?\n\nLANCE.\nThe blackest news that ever thou heard’st.\n\nSPEED.\nWhy, man? How black?\n\nLANCE.\nWhy, as black as ink.\n\nSPEED.\nLet me read them.\n\nLANCE.\nFie on thee, jolt-head, thou canst not read.\n\nSPEED.\nThou liest. I can.\n\nLANCE.\nI will try thee. Tell me this, who begot thee?\n\nSPEED.\nMarry, the son of my grandfather.\n\nLANCE.\nO, illiterate loiterer! It was the son of thy grandmother.\nThis proves that thou canst not read.\n\nSPEED.\nCome, fool, come; try me in thy paper.\n\nLANCE.\n[Gives him the paper.] There; and Saint Nicholas be thy speed.\n\nSPEED.\nImprimis, She can milk.\n\nLANCE.\nAy, that she can.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She brews good ale.\n\nLANCE.\nAnd thereof comes the proverb, “Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale.”\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She can sew.\n\nLANCE.\nThat’s as much as to say, “Can she so?”\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She can knit.\n\nLANCE.\nWhat need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can knit him a stock?\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She can wash and scour.\n\nLANCE.\nA special virtue, for then she need not be washed and scoured.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She can spin.\n\nLANCE.\nThen may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for her living.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She hath many nameless virtues.\n\nLANCE.\nThat’s as much as to say, “bastard virtues”, that indeed know not their fathers, and therefore have no names.\n\nSPEED.\nHere follow her vices.\n\nLANCE.\nClose at the heels of her virtues.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breath.\n\nLANCE.\nWell, that fault may be mended with a breakfast.\nRead on.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She hath a sweet mouth.\n\nLANCE.\nThat makes amends for her sour breath.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She doth talk in her sleep.\n\nLANCE.\nIt’s no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She is slow in words.\n\nLANCE.\nO villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow in words is a woman’s only virtue. I pray thee, out with’t, and place it for her chief virtue.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She is proud.\n\nLANCE.\nOut with that too; it was Eve’s legacy and cannot be ta’en from her.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She hath no teeth.\n\nLANCE.\nI care not for that neither, because I love crusts.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She is curst.\n\nLANCE.\nWell, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She will often praise her liquor.\n\nLANCE.\nIf her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I will, for good things should be praised.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She is too liberal.\n\nLANCE.\nOf her tongue she cannot, for that’s writ down she is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that I’ll keep shut. Now, of another thing she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.\n\nLANCE.\nStop there; I’ll have her. She was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse that once more.\n\nSPEED.\nItem, She hath more hair than wit—\n\nLANCE.\nMore hair than wit. It may be; I’ll prove it: the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the greater hides the less. What’s next?\n\nSPEED.\nAnd more faults than hairs.\n\nLANCE.\nThat’s monstrous! O, that that were out!\n\nSPEED.\nAnd more wealth than faults.\n\nLANCE.\nWhy, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, I’ll have her; an if it be a match, as nothing is impossible—\n\nSPEED.\nWhat then?\n\nLANCE.\nWhy, then will I tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the North Gate.\n\nSPEED.\nFor me?\n\nLANCE.\nFor thee? Ay, who art thou? He hath stayed for a better man than thee.\n\nSPEED.\nAnd must I go to him?\n\nLANCE.\nThou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn.\n\nSPEED.\nWhy didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love letters!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nLANCE.\nNow will he be swinged for reading my letter; an unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into secrets. I’ll after, to rejoice in the boy’s correction.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE IV. The same\nEnter Lance with his dog Crab.\n\nLANCE.\nWhen a man’s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him even as one would say precisely, “Thus I would teach a dog.” I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon’s leg. O, ’tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for’t; sure as I live, he had suffered for’t. You shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the Duke’s table; he had not been there—bless the mark!—a pissing-while but all the chamber smelt him. “Out with the dog!” says one; “What cur is that?” says another; “Whip him out”, says the third; “Hang him up”, says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. “Friend,” quoth I, “you mean to whip the dog?” “Ay, marry do I,” quoth he. “You do him the more wrong,” quoth I. “’Twas I did the thing you wot of.” He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I’ll be sworn I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed. I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for’t. [To Crab.] Thou think’st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?\n\nEnter Proteus and Julia disguised as Sebastian.\n\nPROTEUS.\nSebastian is thy name? I like thee well,\nAnd will employ thee in some service presently.\n\nJULIA.\nIn what you please; I’ll do what I can.\n\nPROTEUS.\nI hope thou wilt. [To Lance.] How now, you whoreson peasant,\nWhere have you been these two days loitering?\n\nLANCE.\nMarry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.\n\nPROTEUS.\nAnd what says she to my little jewel?\n\nLANCE.\nMarry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present.\n\nPROTEUS.\nBut she received my dog?\n\nLANCE.\nNo, indeed, did she not. Here have I brought him back again.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhat, didst thou offer her this from me?\n\nLANCE.\nAy, sir, the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman’s boys in the market-place, and then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.\n\nPROTEUS.\nGo, get thee hence, and find my dog again,\nOr ne’er return again into my sight.\nAway, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here?\nA slave that still an end turns me to shame.\n\n[Exit Lance with Crab.]\n\nSebastian, I have entertained thee\nPartly that I have need of such a youth\nThat can with some discretion do my business—\nFor ’tis no trusting to yond foolish lout—\nBut chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,\nWhich, if my augury deceive me not,\nWitness good bringing up, fortune, and truth.\nTherefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.\nGo presently, and take this ring with thee,\nDeliver it to Madam Silvia.\nShe loved me well delivered it to me.\n\nJULIA.\nIt seems you loved not her, to leave her token.\nShe’s dead belike?\n\nPROTEUS.\nNot so; I think she lives.\n\nJULIA.\nAlas!\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhy dost thou cry “Alas”?\n\nJULIA.\nI cannot choose\nBut pity her.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWherefore shouldst thou pity her?\n\nJULIA.\nBecause methinks that she loved you as well\nAs you do love your lady Silvia.\nShe dreams on him that has forgot her love;\nYou dote on her that cares not for your love.\n’Tis pity love should be so contrary;\nAnd thinking on it makes me cry “Alas.”\n\nPROTEUS.\nWell, give her that ring, and therewithal\nThis letter. That’s her chamber. Tell my lady\nI claim the promise for her heavenly picture.\nYour message done, hie home unto my chamber,\nWhere thou shalt find me sad and solitary.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nJULIA.\nHow many women would do such a message?\nAlas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertained\nA fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.\nAlas, poor fool, why do I pity him\nThat with his very heart despiseth me?\nBecause he loves her, he despiseth me;\nBecause I love him, I must pity him.\nThis ring I gave him when he parted from me,\nTo bind him to remember my good will;\nAnd now am I, unhappy messenger,\nTo plead for that which I would not obtain,\nTo carry that which I would have refused,\nTo praise his faith, which I would have dispraised.\nI am my master’s true confirmed love,\nBut cannot be true servant to my master\nUnless I prove false traitor to myself.\nYet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly\nAs, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.\n\nEnter Silvia attended.\n\nGentlewoman, good day. I pray you be my mean\nTo bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.\n\nSILVIA.\nWhat would you with her, if that I be she?\n\nJULIA.\nIf you be she, I do entreat your patience\nTo hear me speak the message I am sent on.\n\nSILVIA.\nFrom whom?\n\nJULIA.\nFrom my master, Sir Proteus, madam.\n\nSILVIA.\nO, he sends you for a picture?\n\nJULIA.\nAy, madam.\n\nSILVIA.\nUrsula, bring my picture there.\n\n[She is brought the picture.]\n\nGo, give your master this. Tell him from me,\nOne Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,\nWould better fit his chamber than this shadow.\n\nJULIA.\nMadam, please you peruse this letter.\n\n[Gives her a letter.]\n\nPardon me, madam, I have unadvised\nDelivered you a paper that I should not.\nThis is the letter to your ladyship.\n\n[Takes back the letter and gives her another.]\n\nSILVIA.\nI pray thee, let me look on that again.\n\nJULIA.\nIt may not be. Good madam, pardon me.\n\nSILVIA.\nThere, hold.\nI will not look upon your master’s lines.\nI know they are stuffed with protestations\nAnd full of new-found oaths, which he will break\nAs easily as I do tear his paper.\n\n[She tears the second letter.]\n\nJULIA.\nMadam, he sends your ladyship this ring.\n\nSILVIA.\nThe more shame for him that he sends it me;\nFor I have heard him say a thousand times\nHis Julia gave it him at his departure.\nThough his false finger have profaned the ring,\nMine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.\n\nJULIA.\nShe thanks you.\n\nSILVIA.\nWhat sayst thou?\n\nJULIA.\nI thank you, madam, that you tender her.\nPoor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.\n\nSILVIA.\nDost thou know her?\n\nJULIA.\nAlmost as well as I do know myself.\nTo think upon her woes, I do protest\nThat I have wept a hundred several times.\n\nSILVIA.\nBelike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?\n\nJULIA.\nI think she doth, and that’s her cause of sorrow.\n\nSILVIA.\nIs she not passing fair?\n\nJULIA.\nShe hath been fairer, madam, than she is.\nWhen she did think my master loved her well,\nShe, in my judgement, was as fair as you.\nBut since she did neglect her looking-glass\nAnd threw her sun-expelling mask away,\nThe air hath starved the roses in her cheeks\nAnd pinched the lily-tincture of her face,\nThat now she is become as black as I.\n\nSILVIA.\nHow tall was she?\n\nJULIA.\nAbout my stature; for at Pentecost,\nWhen all our pageants of delight were played,\nOur youth got me to play the woman’s part,\nAnd I was trimmed in Madam Julia’s gown,\nWhich served me as fit, by all men’s judgements,\nAs if the garment had been made for me;\nTherefore I know she is about my height.\nAnd at that time I made her weep agood,\nFor I did play a lamentable part.\nMadam, ’twas Ariadne, passioning\nFor Theseus’ perjury and unjust flight,\nWhich I so lively acted with my tears\nThat my poor mistress, moved therewithal,\nWept bitterly; and would I might be dead\nIf I in thought felt not her very sorrow.\n\nSILVIA.\nShe is beholding to thee, gentle youth.\nAlas, poor lady, desolate and left!\nI weep myself to think upon thy words.\nHere, youth, there is my purse. I give thee this\nFor thy sweet mistress’ sake, because thou lov’st her.\nFarewell.\n\nJULIA.\nAnd she shall thank you for’t, if e’er you know her.\n\n[Exeunt Silvia and Attendants.]\n\nA virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful.\nI hope my master’s suit will be but cold,\nSince she respects my mistress’ love so much.\nAlas, how love can trifle with itself!\nHere is her picture; let me see. I think\nIf I had such a tire, this face of mine\nWere full as lovely as is this of hers;\nAnd yet the painter flattered her a little,\nUnless I flatter with myself too much.\nHer hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow;\nIf that be all the difference in his love,\nI’ll get me such a coloured periwig.\nHer eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine.\nAy, but her forehead’s low, and mine’s as high.\nWhat should it be that he respects in her\nBut I can make respective in myself,\nIf this fond Love were not a blinded god?\nCome, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,\nFor ’tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,\nThou shalt be worshipped, kissed, loved, and adored;\nAnd were there sense in his idolatry,\nMy substance should be statue in thy stead.\nI’ll use thee kindly for thy mistress’ sake,\nThat used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,\nI should have scratched out your unseeing eyes\nTo make my master out of love with thee.\n\n[Exit.]",

That my leg is too long?\n\nPROTEUS.\nNo, that it is too little.\n\nTHURIO.\nI’ll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.\n\nJULIA.\n[Aside.] But love will not be spurred to what it loathes.\n\nTHURIO.\nWhat says she to my face?\n\nPROTEUS.\nShe says it is a fair one.\n\nTHURIO.\nNay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.\n\nPROTEUS.\nBut pearls are fair; and the old saying is,\n“Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes.”\n\nJULIA.\n[Aside.] ’Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies’ eyes,\nFor I had rather wink than look on them.\n\nTHURIO.\nHow likes she my discourse?\n\nPROTEUS.\nIll, when you talk of war.\n\nTHURIO.\nBut well when I discourse of love and peace.\n\nJULIA.\n[Aside.] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.\n\nTHURIO.\nWhat says she to my valour?\n\nPROTEUS.\nO, sir, she makes no doubt of that.\n\nJULIA.\n[Aside.] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.\n\nTHURIO.\nWhat says she to my birth?\n\nPROTEUS.\nThat you are well derived.\n\nJULIA.\n[Aside.] True, from a gentleman to a fool.\n\nTHURIO.\nConsiders she my possessions?\n\nPROTEUS.\nO, ay, and pities them.\n\nTHURIO.\nWherefore?\n\nJULIA.\n[Aside.] That such an ass should owe them.\n\nPROTEUS.\nThat they are out by lease.\n\nJULIA.\nHere comes the Duke.\n\nEnter Duke.\n\nDUKE.\nHow now, Sir Proteus! How now, Thurio!\nWhich of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?\n\nTHURIO.\nNot I.\n\nPROTEUS.\nNor I.\n\nDUKE.\nSaw you my daughter?\n\nPROTEUS.\nNeither.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy then, she’s fled unto that peasant Valentine,\nAnd Eglamour is in her company.\n’Tis true, for Friar Lawrence met them both\nAs he in penance wandered through the forest;\nHim he knew well, and guessed that it was she,\nBut, being masked, he was not sure of it.\nBesides, she did intend confession\nAt Patrick’s cell this even, and there she was not.\nThese likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.\nTherefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,\nBut mount you presently and meet with me\nUpon the rising of the mountain foot\nThat leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.\nDispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTHURIO.\nWhy, this it is to be a peevish girl\nThat flies her fortune when it follows her.\nI’ll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour\nThan for the love of reckless Silvia.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPROTEUS.\nAnd I will follow, more for Silvia’s love\nThan hate of Eglamour that goes with her.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nJULIA.\nAnd I will follow, more to cross that love\nThan hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE IV. Another part of the forest\nEnter Valentine.\n\nVALENTINE.\nHow use doth breed a habit in a man!\nThis shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,\nI better brook than flourishing peopled towns.\nHere can I sit alone, unseen of any,\nAnd to the nightingale’s complaining notes\nTune my distresses and record my woes.\nO thou that dost inhabit in my breast,\nLeave not the mansion so long tenantless,\nLest, growing ruinous, the building fall\nAnd leave no memory of what it was.\nRepair me with thy presence, Silvia;\nThou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.\n\n[Shouts within.]\n\nWhat hallowing and what stir is this today?\nThese are my mates, that make their wills their law,\nHave some unhappy passenger in chase.\nThey love me well; yet I have much to do\nTo keep them from uncivil outrages.\nWithdraw thee, Valentine. Who’s this comes here?\n\n[Steps aside.]\n\nEnter Proteus, Silvia and Julia as Sebastian.\n\nPROTEUS.\nMadam, this service I have done for you—\nThough you respect not aught your servant doth—\nTo hazard life, and rescue you from him\nThat would have forced your honour and your love.\nVouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look;\nA smaller boon than this I cannot beg,\nAnd less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.\n\nVALENTINE.\n[Aside.] How like a dream is this I see and hear!\nLove, lend me patience to forbear awhile.\n\nSILVIA.\nO miserable, unhappy that I am!\n\nPROTEUS.\nUnhappy were you, madam, ere I came;\nBut by my coming I have made you happy.\n\nSILVIA.\nBy thy approach thou mak’st me most unhappy.\n\nJULIA.\n[Aside.] And me, when he approacheth to your presence.\n\nSILVIA.\nHad I been seized by a hungry lion,\nI would have been a breakfast to the beast\nRather than have false Proteus rescue me.\nO heaven, be judge how I love Valentine,\nWhose life’s as tender to me as my soul!\nAnd full as much, for more there cannot be,\nI do detest false perjured Proteus.\nTherefore be gone, solicit me no more.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhat dangerous action, stood it next to death,\nWould I not undergo for one calm look!\nO, ’tis the curse in love, and still approved,\nWhen women cannot love where they’re beloved.\n\nSILVIA.\nWhen Proteus cannot love where he’s beloved.\nRead over Julia’s heart, thy first best love,\nFor whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith\nInto a thousand oaths; and all those oaths\nDescended into perjury to love me.\nThou hast no faith left now, unless thou’dst two,\nAnd that’s far worse than none; better have none\nThan plural faith, which is too much by one.\nThou counterfeit to thy true friend!\n\nPROTEUS.\nIn love\nWho respects friend?\n\nSILVIA.\nAll men but Proteus.\n\nPROTEUS.\nNay, if the gentle spirit of moving words\nCan no way change you to a milder form,\nI’ll woo you like a soldier, at arms’ end,\nAnd love you ’gainst the nature of love—force ye.\n\n[He seizes her.]\n\nSILVIA.\nO heaven!\n\nPROTEUS.\nI’ll force thee yield to my desire.\n\nVALENTINE.\n[Comes forward.] Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,\nThou friend of an ill fashion!\n\nPROTEUS.\nValentine!\n\nVALENTINE.\nThou common friend, that’s without faith or love,\nFor such is a friend now. Treacherous man,\nThou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye\nCould have persuaded me. Now I dare not say\nI have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.\nWho should be trusted, when one’s right hand\nIs perjured to the bosom? Proteus,\nI am sorry I must never trust thee more,\nBut count the world a stranger for thy sake.\nThe private wound is deepest. O time most accurst,\n’Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!\n\nPROTEUS.\nMy shame and guilt confounds me.\nForgive me, Valentine; if hearty sorrow\nBe a sufficient ransom for offence,\nI tender ’t here. I do as truly suffer\nAs e’er I did commit.\n\nVALENTINE.\nThen I am paid,\nAnd once again I do receive thee honest.\nWho by repentance is not satisfied\nIs nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased;\nBy penitence th’ Eternal’s wrath’s appeased.\nAnd that my love may appear plain and free,\nAll that was mine in Silvia I give thee.\n\nJULIA.\nO me unhappy!\n\n[Swoons.]\n\nPROTEUS.\nLook to the boy.\n\nVALENTINE.\nWhy, boy!\nWhy, wag! How now? What’s the matter? Look up; speak.\n\nJULIA.\nO good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia, which out of my neglect was never done.\n\nPROTEUS.\nWhere is that ring, boy?\n\nJULIA.\nHere ’tis; this is it.\n\n[Gives him a ring.]\n\nPROTEUS.\nHow, let me see.\nWhy, this is the ring I gave to Julia.\n\nJULIA.\nO, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook.\nThis is the ring you sent to Silvia.\n\n[Shows another ring.]\n\nPROTEUS.\nBut how cam’st thou by this ring? At my depart\nI gave this unto Julia.\n\nJULIA.\nAnd Julia herself did give it me,\nAnd Julia herself have brought it hither.\n\n[She reveals herself.]\n\nPROTEUS.\nHow? Julia?\n\nJULIA.\nBehold her that gave aim to all thy oaths\nAnd entertained ’em deeply in her heart.\nHow oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!\nO Proteus, let this habit make thee blush.\nBe thou ashamed that I have took upon me\nSuch an immodest raiment, if shame live\nIn a disguise of love.\nIt is the lesser blot, modesty finds,\nWomen to change their shapes than men their minds.\n\nPROTEUS.\nThan men their minds! ’Tis true. O heaven, were man\nBut constant, he were perfect. That one error\nFills him with faults, makes him run through all th’ sins;\nInconstancy falls off ere it begins.\nWhat is in Silvia’s face but I may spy\nMore fresh in Julia’s with a constant eye?\n\nVALENTINE.\nCome, come, a hand from either.\nLet me be blest to make this happy close.\n’Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.\n\nPROTEUS.\nBear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.\n\nJULIA.\nAnd I mine.\n\nEnter Outlaws with Duke and Thurio.\n\nOUTLAWS.\nA prize, a prize, a prize!\n\nVALENTINE.\nForbear, forbear, I say! It is my lord the Duke.\nYour Grace is welcome to a man disgraced,\nBanished Valentine.\n\nDUKE.\nSir Valentine!\n\nTHURIO.\nYonder is Silvia, and Silvia’s mine.\n\nVALENTINE.\nThurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;\nCome not within the measure of my wrath.\nDo not name Silvia thine; if once again,\nVerona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;\nTake but possession of her with a touch—\nI dare thee but to breathe upon my love.\n\nTHURIO.\nSir Valentine, I care not for her, I.\nI hold him but a fool that will endanger\nHis body for a girl that loves him not.\nI claim her not, and therefore she is thine.\n\nDUKE.\nThe more degenerate and base art thou\nTo make such means for her as thou hast done,\nAnd leave her on such slight conditions.—\nNow, by the honour of my ancestry,\nI do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,\nAnd think thee worthy of an empress’ love.\nKnow then, I here forget all former griefs,\nCancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,\nPlead a new state in thy unrivalled merit,\nTo which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,\nThou art a gentleman, and well derived;\nTake thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.\n\nVALENTINE.\nI thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.\nI now beseech you, for your daughter’s sake,\nTo grant one boon that I shall ask of you.\n\nDUKE.\nI grant it for thine own, whate’er it be.\n\nVALENTINE.\nThese banished men, that I have kept withal,\nAre men endued with worthy qualities.\nForgive them what they have committed here,\nAnd let them be recalled from their exile.\nThey are reformed, civil, full of good,\nAnd fit for great employment, worthy lord.\n\nDUKE.\nThou hast prevailed; I pardon them and thee.\nDispose of them as thou know’st their deserts.\nCome, let us go; we will include all jars\nWith triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.\n\nVALENTINE.\nAnd as we walk along, I dare be bold\nWith our discourse to make your Grace to smile.\nWhat think you of this page, my lord?\n\nDUKE.\nI think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.\n\nVALENTINE.\nI warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat mean you by that saying?\n\nVALENTINE.\nPlease you, I’ll tell you as we pass along,\nThat you will wonder what hath fortuned.\nCome, Proteus, ’tis your penance but to hear\nThe story of your loves discovered.\nThat done, our day of marriage shall be yours,\nOne feast, one house, one mutual happiness.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
