Be thou the trumpet of our wrath\nAnd sullen presage of your own decay.\nAn honourable conduct let him have:\nPembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.\nExeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE\n\nQUEEN ELINOR\nWhat now, my son! have I not ever said\nHow that ambitious Constance would not cease\nTill she had kindled France and all the world,\nUpon the right and party of her son?\nThis might have been prevented and made whole\nWith very easy arguments of love,\nWhich now the manage of two kingdoms must\nWith fearful bloody issue arbitrate.\nKING JOHN\nOur strong possession and our right for us.\nQUEEN ELINOR\nYour strong possession much more than your right,\nOr else it must go wrong with you and me:\nSo much my conscience whispers in your ear,\nWhich none but heaven and you and I shall hear.\nEnter a Sheriff\n\nESSEX\nMy liege, here is the strangest controversy\nCome from country to be judged by you,\nThat e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?\nKING JOHN\nLet them approach.\nOur abbeys and our priories shall pay\nThis expedition's charge.\nEnter ROBERT and the BASTARD\n\nWhat men are you?\nBASTARD\nYour faithful subject I, a gentleman\nBorn in Northamptonshire and eldest son,\nAs I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,\nA soldier, by the honour-giving hand\nOf Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.\nKING JOHN\nWhat art thou?\nROBERT\nThe son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.\nKING JOHN\nIs that the elder, and art thou the heir?\nYou came not of one mother then, it seems.\nBASTARD\nMost certain of one mother, mighty king;\nThat is well known; and, as I think, one father:\nBut for the certain knowledge of that truth\nI put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:\nOf that I doubt, as all men's children may.\nQUEEN ELINOR\nOut on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother\nAnd wound her honour with this diffidence.\nBASTARD\nI, madam? no, I have no reason for it;\nThat is my brother's plea and none of mine;\nThe which if he can prove, a' pops me out\nAt least from fair five hundred pound a year:\nHeaven guard my mother's honour and my land!\nKING JOHN\nA good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,\nDoth he lay claim to thine inheritance?\nBASTARD\nI know not why, except to get the land.\nBut once he slander'd me with bastardy:\nBut whether I be as true begot or no,\nThat still I lay upon my mother's head,\nBut that I am as well begot, my liege,--\nFair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--\nCompare our faces and be judge yourself.\nIf old sir Robert did beget us both\nAnd were our father and this son like him,\nO old sir Robert, father, on my knee\nI give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!\nKING JOHN\nWhy, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!\nQUEEN ELINOR\nHe hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;\nThe accent of his tongue affecteth him.\nDo you not read some tokens of my son\nIn the large composition of this man?\nKING JOHN\nMine eye hath well examined his parts\nAnd finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,\nWhat doth move you to claim your brother's land?\nBASTARD\nBecause he hath a half-face, like my father.\nWith half that face would he have all my land:\nA half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!\nROBERT\nMy gracious liege, when that my father lived,\nYour brother did employ my father much,--\nBASTARD\nWell, sir, by this you cannot get my land:\nYour tale must be how he employ'd my mother.\nROBERT\nAnd once dispatch'd him in an embassy\nTo Germany, there with the emperor\nTo treat of high affairs touching that time.\nThe advantage of his absence took the king\nAnd in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;\nWhere how he did prevail I shame to speak,\nBut truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores\nBetween my father and my mother lay,\nAs I have heard my father speak himself,\nWhen this same lusty gentleman was got.\nUpon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd\nHis lands to me, and took it on his death\nThat this my mother's son was none of his;\nAnd if he were, he came into the world\nFull fourteen weeks before the course of time.\nThen, good my liege, let me have what is mine,\nMy father's land, as was my father's will.\nKING JOHN\nSirrah, your brother is legitimate;\nYour father's wife did after wedlock bear him,\nAnd if she did play false, the fault was hers;\nWhich fault lies on the hazards of all husbands\nThat marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,\nWho, as you say, took pains to get this son,\nHad of your father claim'd this son for his?\nIn sooth, good friend, your father might have kept\nThis calf bred from his cow from all the world;\nIn sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,\nMy brother might not claim him; nor your father,\nBeing none of his, refuse him: this concludes;\nMy mother's son did get your father's heir;\nYour father's heir must have your father's land.\nROBERT\nShall then my father's will be of no force\nTo dispossess that child which is not his?\nBASTARD\nOf no more force to dispossess me, sir,\nThan was his will to get me, as I think.\nQUEEN ELINOR\nWhether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge\nAnd like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,\nOr the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,\nLord of thy presence and no land beside?\nBASTARD\nMadam, an if my brother had my shape,\nAnd I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;\nAnd if my legs were two such riding-rods,\nMy arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin\nThat in mine ear I durst not stick a rose\nLest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'\nAnd, to his shape, were heir to all this land,\nWould I might never stir from off this place,\nI would give it every foot to have this face;\nI would not be sir Nob in any case.\nQUEEN ELINOR\nI like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,\nBequeath thy land to him and follow me?\nI am a soldier and now bound to France.\nBASTARD\nBrother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.\nYour face hath got five hundred pound a year,\nYet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.\nMadam, I'll follow you unto the death.\nQUEEN ELINOR\nNay, I would have you go before me thither.\nBASTARD\nOur country manners give our betters way.\nKING JOHN\nWhat is thy name?\nBASTARD\nPhilip, my liege, so is my name begun,\nPhilip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.\nKING JOHN\nFrom henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:\nKneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,\nArise sir Richard and Plantagenet.\nBASTARD\nBrother by the mother's side, give me your hand:\nMy father gave me honour, yours gave land.\nNow blessed by the hour, by night or day,\nWhen I was got, sir Robert was away!\nQUEEN ELINOR\nThe very spirit of Plantagenet!\nI am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.\nBASTARD\nMadam, by chance but not by truth; what though?\nSomething about, a little from the right,\nIn at the window, or else o'er the hatch:\nWho dares not stir by day must walk by night,\nAnd have is have, however men do catch:\nNear or far off, well won is still well shot,\nAnd I am I, howe'er I was begot.\nKING JOHN\nGo, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;\nA landless knight makes thee a landed squire.\nCome, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed\nFor France, for France, for it is more than need.\nBASTARD\nBrother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!\nFor thou wast got i' the way of honesty.\nExeunt all but BASTARD\n\nA foot of honour better than I was;\nBut many a many foot of land the worse.\nWell, now can I make any Joan a lady.\n'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--\nAnd if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;\nFor new-made honour doth forget men's names;\n'Tis too respective and too sociable\nFor your conversion. Now your traveller,\nHe and his toothpick at my worship's mess,\nAnd when my knightly stomach is sufficed,\nWhy then I suck my teeth and catechise\nMy picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'\nThus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,\n'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;\nAnd then comes answer like an Absey book:\n'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;\nAt your employment; at your service, sir;'\n'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'\nAnd so, ere answer knows what question would,\nSaving in dialogue of compliment,\nAnd talking of the Alps and Apennines,\nThe Pyrenean and the river Po,\nIt draws toward supper in conclusion so.\nBut this is worshipful society\nAnd fits the mounting spirit like myself,\nFor he is but a bastard to the time\nThat doth not smack of observation;\nAnd so am I, whether I smack or no;\nAnd not alone in habit and device,\nExterior form, outward accoutrement,\nBut from the inward motion to deliver\nSweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:\nWhich, though I will not practise to deceive,\nYet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;\nFor it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.\nBut who comes in such haste in riding-robes?\nWhat woman-post is this? hath she no husband\nThat will take pains to blow a horn before her?\nEnter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY\n\nO me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!\nWhat brings you here to court so hastily?\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\nWhere is that slave, thy brother? where is he,\nThat holds in chase mine honour up and down?\nBASTARD\nMy brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?\nColbrand the giant, that same mighty man?\nIs it sir Robert's son that you seek so?\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\nSir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,\nSir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?\nHe is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.\nBASTARD\nJames Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?\nGURNEY\nGood leave, good Philip.\nBASTARD\nPhilip! sparrow: James,\nThere's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.\nExit GURNEY\n\nMadam, I was not old sir Robert's son:\nSir Robert might have eat his part in me\nUpon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:\nSir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,\nCould he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:\nWe know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,\nTo whom am I beholding for these limbs?\nSir Robert never holp to make this leg.\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\nHast thou conspired with thy brother too,\nThat for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?\nWhat means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?\nBASTARD\nKnight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.\nWhat! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.\nBut, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;\nI have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;\nLegitimation, name and all is gone:\nThen, good my mother, let me know my father;\nSome proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\nHast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?\nBASTARD\nAs faithfully as I deny the devil.\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE\nKing Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:\nBy long and vehement suit I was seduced\nTo make room for him in my husband's bed:\nHeaven lay not my transgression to my charge!\nThou art the issue of my dear offence,\nWhich was so strongly urged past my defence.\nBASTARD\nNow, by this light, were I to get again,\nMadam, I would not wish a better father.\nSome sins do bear their privilege on earth,\nAnd so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:\nNeeds must you lay your heart at his dispose,\nSubjected tribute to commanding love,\nAgainst whose fury and unmatched force\nThe aweless lion could not wage the fight,\nNor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.\nHe that perforce robs lions of their hearts\nMay easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,\nWith all my heart I thank thee for my father!\nWho lives and dares but say thou didst not well\nWhen I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.\nCome, lady, I will show thee to my kin;\nAnd they shall say, when Richard me begot,\nIf thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:\nWho says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.\nExeunt",

Mount, chevaliers! to arms!\nBASTARD\nSaint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since\nSits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,\nTeach us some fence!\nTo AUSTRIA\n\nSirrah, were I at home,\nAt your den, sirrah, with your lioness\nI would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,\nAnd make a monster of you.\nAUSTRIA\nPeace! no more.\nBASTARD\nO tremble, for you hear the lion roar.\nKING JOHN\nUp higher to the plain; where we'll set forth\nIn best appointment all our regiments.\nBASTARD\nSpeed then, to take advantage of the field.\nKING PHILIP\nIt shall be so; and at the other hill\nCommand the rest to stand. God and our right!\nExeunt\n\nHere after excursions, enter the Herald of France, with trumpets, to the gates\n\nFrench Herald\nYou men of Angiers, open wide your gates,\nAnd let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,\nWho by the hand of France this day hath made\nMuch work for tears in many an English mother,\nWhose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;\nMany a widow's husband grovelling lies,\nColdly embracing the discolour'd earth;\nAnd victory, with little loss, doth play\nUpon the dancing banners of the French,\nWho are at hand, triumphantly display'd,\nTo enter conquerors and to proclaim\nArthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.\nEnter English Herald, with trumpet\n\nEnglish Herald\nRejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:\nKing John, your king and England's doth approach,\nCommander of this hot malicious day:\nTheir armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,\nHither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;\nThere stuck no plume in any English crest\nThat is removed by a staff of France;\nOur colours do return in those same hands\nThat did display them when we first march'd forth;\nAnd, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come\nOur lusty English, all with purpled hands,\nDyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:\nOpen your gates and gives the victors way.\nFirst Citizen\nHeralds, from off our towers we might behold,\nFrom first to last, the onset and retire\nOf both your armies; whose equality\nBy our best eyes cannot be censured:\nBlood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;\nStrength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:\nBoth are alike; and both alike we like.\nOne must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,\nWe hold our town for neither, yet for both.\nRe-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their powers, severally\n\nKING JOHN\nFrance, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?\nSay, shall the current of our right run on?\nWhose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,\nShall leave his native channel and o'erswell\nWith course disturb'd even thy confining shores,\nUnless thou let his silver water keep\nA peaceful progress to the ocean.\nKING PHILIP\nEngland, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,\nIn this hot trial, more than we of France;\nRather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,\nThat sways the earth this climate overlooks,\nBefore we will lay down our just-borne arms,\nWe'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,\nOr add a royal number to the dead,\nGracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss\nWith slaughter coupled to the name of kings.\nBASTARD\nHa, majesty! how high thy glory towers,\nWhen the rich blood of kings is set on fire!\nO, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;\nThe swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;\nAnd now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,\nIn undetermined differences of kings.\nWhy stand these royal fronts amazed thus?\nCry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,\nYou equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!\nThen let confusion of one part confirm\nThe other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!\nKING JOHN\nWhose party do the townsmen yet admit?\nKING PHILIP\nSpeak, citizens, for England; who's your king?\nFirst Citizen\nThe king of England; when we know the king.\nKING PHILIP\nKnow him in us, that here hold up his right.\nKING JOHN\nIn us, that are our own great deputy\nAnd bear possession of our person here,\nLord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.\nFirst Citizen\nA greater power then we denies all this;\nAnd till it be undoubted, we do lock\nOur former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;\nKing'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,\nBe by some certain king purged and deposed.\nBASTARD\nBy heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,\nAnd stand securely on their battlements,\nAs in a theatre, whence they gape and point\nAt your industrious scenes and acts of death.\nYour royal presences be ruled by me:\nDo like the mutines of Jerusalem,\nBe friends awhile and both conjointly bend\nYour sharpest deeds of malice on this town:\nBy east and west let France and England mount\nTheir battering cannon charged to the mouths,\nTill their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down\nThe flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:\nI'ld play incessantly upon these jades,\nEven till unfenced desolation\nLeave them as naked as the vulgar air.\nThat done, dissever your united strengths,\nAnd part your mingled colours once again;\nTurn face to face and bloody point to point;\nThen, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth\nOut of one side her happy minion,\nTo whom in favour she shall give the day,\nAnd kiss him with a glorious victory.\nHow like you this wild counsel, mighty states?\nSmacks it not something of the policy?\nKING JOHN\nNow, by the sky that hangs above our heads,\nI like it well. France, shall we knit our powers\nAnd lay this Angiers even to the ground;\nThen after fight who shall be king of it?\nBASTARD\nAn if thou hast the mettle of a king,\nBeing wronged as we are by this peevish town,\nTurn thou the mouth of thy artillery,\nAs we will ours, against these saucy walls;\nAnd when that we have dash'd them to the ground,\nWhy then defy each other and pell-mell\nMake work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.\nKING PHILIP\nLet it be so. Say, where will you assault?\nKING JOHN\nWe from the west will send destruction\nInto this city's bosom.\nAUSTRIA\nI from the north.\nKING PHILIP\nOur thunder from the south\nShall rain their drift of bullets on this town.\nBASTARD\nO prudent discipline! From north to south:\nAustria and France shoot in each other's mouth:\nI'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!\nFirst Citizen\nHear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,\nAnd I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;\nWin you this city without stroke or wound;\nRescue those breathing lives to die in beds,\nThat here come sacrifices for the field:\nPersever not, but hear me, mighty kings.\nKING JOHN\nSpeak on with favour; we are bent to hear.\nFirst Citizen\nThat daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,\nIs niece to England: look upon the years\nOf Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:\nIf lusty love should go in quest of beauty,\nWhere should he find it fairer than in Blanch?\nIf zealous love should go in search of virtue,\nWhere should he find it purer than in Blanch?\nIf love ambitious sought a match of birth,\nWhose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?\nSuch as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,\nIs the young Dauphin every way complete:\nIf not complete of, say he is not she;\nAnd she again wants nothing, to name want,\nIf want it be not that she is not he:\nHe is the half part of a blessed man,\nLeft to be finished by such as she;\nAnd she a fair divided excellence,\nWhose fulness of perfection lies in him.\nO, two such silver currents, when they join,\nDo glorify the banks that bound them in;\nAnd two such shores to two such streams made one,\nTwo such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,\nTo these two princes, if you marry them.\nThis union shall do more than battery can\nTo our fast-closed gates; for at this match,\nWith swifter spleen than powder can enforce,\nThe mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,\nAnd give you entrance: but without this match,\nThe sea enraged is not half so deaf,\nLions more confident, mountains and rocks\nMore free from motion, no, not Death himself\nIn moral fury half so peremptory,\nAs we to keep this city.\nBASTARD\nHere's a stay\nThat shakes the rotten carcass of old Death\nOut of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,\nThat spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,\nTalks as familiarly of roaring lions\nAs maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!\nWhat cannoneer begot this lusty blood?\nHe speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;\nHe gives the bastinado with his tongue:\nOur ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his\nBut buffets better than a fist of France:\nZounds! I was never so bethump'd with words\nSince I first call'd my brother's father dad.\nQUEEN ELINOR\nSon, list to this conjunction, make this match;\nGive with our niece a dowry large enough:\nFor by this knot thou shalt so surely tie\nThy now unsured assurance to the crown,\nThat yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe\nThe bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.\nI see a yielding in the looks of France;\nMark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls\nAre capable of this ambition,\nLest zeal, now melted by the windy breath\nOf soft petitions, pity and remorse,\nCool and congeal again to what it was.\nFirst Citizen\nWhy answer not the double majesties\nThis friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?\nKING PHILIP\nSpeak England first, that hath been forward first\nTo speak unto this city: what say you?\nKING JOHN\nIf that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,\nCan in this book of beauty read 'I love,'\nHer dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:\nFor Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,\nAnd all that we upon this side the sea,\nExcept this city now by us besieged,\nFind liable to our crown and dignity,\nShall gild her bridal bed and make her rich\nIn titles, honours and promotions,\nAs she in beauty, education, blood,\nHolds hand with any princess of the world.\nKING PHILIP\nWhat say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.\nLEWIS\nI do, my lord; and in her eye I find\nA wonder, or a wondrous miracle,\nThe shadow of myself form'd in her eye:\nWhich being but the shadow of your son,\nBecomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:\nI do protest I never loved myself\nTill now infixed I beheld myself\nDrawn in the flattering table of her eye.\nWhispers with BLANCH\n\nBASTARD\nDrawn in the flattering table of her eye!\nHang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!\nAnd quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy\nHimself love's traitor: this is pity now,\nThat hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be\nIn such a love so vile a lout as he.\nBLANCH\nMy uncle's will in this respect is mine:\nIf he see aught in you that makes him like,\nThat any thing he sees, which moves his liking,\nI can with ease translate it to my will;\nOr if you will, to speak more properly,\nI will enforce it easily to my love.\nFurther I will not flatter you, my lord,\nThat all I see in you is worthy love,\nThan this; that nothing do I see in you,\nThough churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,\nThat I can find should merit any hate.\nKING JOHN\nWhat say these young ones? What say you my niece?\nBLANCH\nThat she is bound in honour still to do\nWhat you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.\nKING JOHN\nSpeak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?\nLEWIS\nNay, ask me if I can refrain from love;\nFor I do love her most unfeignedly.\nKING JOHN\nThen do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,\nPoictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,\nWith her to thee; and this addition more,\nFull thirty thousand marks of English coin.\nPhilip of France, if thou be pleased withal,\nCommand thy son and daughter to join hands.\nKING PHILIP\nIt likes us well; young princes, close your hands.\nAUSTRIA\nAnd your lips too; for I am well assured\nThat I did so when I was first assured.\nKING PHILIP\nNow, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,\nLet in that amity which you have made;\nFor at Saint Mary's chapel presently\nThe rites of marriage shall be solemnized.\nIs not the Lady Constance in this troop?\nI know she is not, for this match made up\nHer presence would have interrupted much:\nWhere is she and her son? tell me, who knows.\nLEWIS\nShe is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.\nKING PHILIP\nAnd, by my faith, this league that we have made\nWill give her sadness very little cure.\nBrother of England, how may we content\nThis widow lady? In her right we came;\nWhich we, God knows, have turn'd another way,\nTo our own vantage.\nKING JOHN\nWe will heal up all;\nFor we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne\nAnd Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town\nWe make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;\nSome speedy messenger bid her repair\nTo our solemnity: I trust we shall,\nIf not fill up the measure of her will,\nYet in some measure satisfy her so\nThat we shall stop her exclamation.\nGo we, as well as haste will suffer us,\nTo this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.\nExeunt all but the BASTARD\n\nBASTARD\nMad world! mad kings! mad composition!\nJohn, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,\nHath willingly departed with a part,\nAnd France, whose armour conscience buckled on,\nWhom zeal and charity brought to the field\nAs God's own soldier, rounded in the ear\nWith that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,\nThat broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,\nThat daily break-vow, he that wins of all,\nOf kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,\nWho, having no external thing to lose\nBut the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,\nThat smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,\nCommodity, the bias of the world,\nThe world, who of itself is peised well,\nMade to run even upon even ground,\nTill this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,\nThis sway of motion, this Commodity,\nMakes it take head from all indifferency,\nFrom all direction, purpose, course, intent:\nAnd this same bias, this Commodity,\nThis bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,\nClapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,\nHath drawn him from his own determined aid,\nFrom a resolved and honourable war,\nTo a most base and vile-concluded peace.\nAnd why rail I on this Commodity?\nBut for because he hath not woo'd me yet:\nNot that I have the power to clutch my hand,\nWhen his fair angels would salute my palm;\nBut for my hand, as unattempted yet,\nLike a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.\nWell, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail\nAnd say there is no sin but to be rich;\nAnd being rich, my virtue then shall be\nTo say there is no vice but beggary.\nSince kings break faith upon commodity,\nGain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.\nExit",

Thou cold-blooded slave,\nHast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,\nBeen sworn my soldier, bidding me depend\nUpon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,\nAnd dost thou now fall over to my fores?\nThou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,\nAnd hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.\nAUSTRIA\nO, that a man should speak those words to me!\nBASTARD\nAnd hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.\nAUSTRIA\nThou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.\nBASTARD\nAnd hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.\nKING JOHN\nWe like not this; thou dost forget thyself.\nEnter CARDINAL PANDULPH\n\nKING PHILIP\nHere comes the holy legate of the pope.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nHail, you anointed deputies of heaven!\nTo thee, King John, my holy errand is.\nI Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,\nAnd from Pope Innocent the legate here,\nDo in his name religiously demand\nWhy thou against the church, our holy mother,\nSo wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce\nKeep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop\nOf Canterbury, from that holy see?\nThis, in our foresaid holy father's name,\nPope Innocent, I do demand of thee.\nKING JOHN\nWhat earthy name to interrogatories\nCan task the free breath of a sacred king?\nThou canst not, cardinal, devise a name\nSo slight, unworthy and ridiculous,\nTo charge me to an answer, as the pope.\nTell him this tale; and from the mouth of England\nAdd thus much more, that no Italian priest\nShall tithe or toll in our dominions;\nBut as we, under heaven, are supreme head,\nSo under Him that great supremacy,\nWhere we do reign, we will alone uphold,\nWithout the assistance of a mortal hand:\nSo tell the pope, all reverence set apart\nTo him and his usurp'd authority.\nKING PHILIP\nBrother of England, you blaspheme in this.\nKING JOHN\nThough you and all the kings of Christendom\nAre led so grossly by this meddling priest,\nDreading the curse that money may buy out;\nAnd by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,\nPurchase corrupted pardon of a man,\nWho in that sale sells pardon from himself,\nThough you and all the rest so grossly led\nThis juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,\nYet I alone, alone do me oppose\nAgainst the pope and count his friends my foes.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nThen, by the lawful power that I have,\nThou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.\nAnd blessed shall he be that doth revolt\nFrom his allegiance to an heretic;\nAnd meritorious shall that hand be call'd,\nCanonized and worshipped as a saint,\nThat takes away by any secret course\nThy hateful life.\nCONSTANCE\nO, lawful let it be\nThat I have room with Rome to curse awhile!\nGood father cardinal, cry thou amen\nTo my keen curses; for without my wrong\nThere is no tongue hath power to curse him right.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nThere's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.\nCONSTANCE\nAnd for mine too: when law can do no right,\nLet it be lawful that law bar no wrong:\nLaw cannot give my child his kingdom here,\nFor he that holds his kingdom holds the law;\nTherefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,\nHow can the law forbid my tongue to curse?\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nPhilip of France, on peril of a curse,\nLet go the hand of that arch-heretic;\nAnd raise the power of France upon his head,\nUnless he do submit himself to Rome.\nQUEEN ELINOR\nLook'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.\nCONSTANCE\nLook to that, devil; lest that France repent,\nAnd by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.\nAUSTRIA\nKing Philip, listen to the cardinal.\nBASTARD\nAnd hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.\nAUSTRIA\nWell, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--\nBASTARD\nYour breeches best may carry them.\nKING JOHN\nPhilip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?\nCONSTANCE\nWhat should he say, but as the cardinal?\nLEWIS\nBethink you, father; for the difference\nIs purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,\nOr the light loss of England for a friend:\nForego the easier.\nBLANCH\nThat's the curse of Rome.\nCONSTANCE\nO Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here\nIn likeness of a new untrimmed bride.\nBLANCH\nThe Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,\nBut from her need.\nCONSTANCE\nO, if thou grant my need,\nWhich only lives but by the death of faith,\nThat need must needs infer this principle,\nThat faith would live again by death of need.\nO then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;\nKeep my need up, and faith is trodden down!\nKING JOHN\nThe king is moved, and answers not to this.\nCONSTANCE\nO, be removed from him, and answer well!\nAUSTRIA\nDo so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.\nBASTARD\nHang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.\nKING PHILIP\nI am perplex'd, and know not what to say.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nWhat canst thou say but will perplex thee more,\nIf thou stand excommunicate and cursed?\nKING PHILIP\nGood reverend father, make my person yours,\nAnd tell me how you would bestow yourself.\nThis royal hand and mine are newly knit,\nAnd the conjunction of our inward souls\nMarried in league, coupled and linked together\nWith all religious strength of sacred vows;\nThe latest breath that gave the sound of words\nWas deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love\nBetween our kingdoms and our royal selves,\nAnd even before this truce, but new before,\nNo longer than we well could wash our hands\nTo clap this royal bargain up of peace,\nHeaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd\nWith slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint\nThe fearful difference of incensed kings:\nAnd shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,\nSo newly join'd in love, so strong in both,\nUnyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?\nPlay fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,\nMake such unconstant children of ourselves,\nAs now again to snatch our palm from palm,\nUnswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed\nOf smiling peace to march a bloody host,\nAnd make a riot on the gentle brow\nOf true sincerity? O, holy sir,\nMy reverend father, let it not be so!\nOut of your grace, devise, ordain, impose\nSome gentle order; and then we shall be blest\nTo do your pleasure and continue friends.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nAll form is formless, order orderless,\nSave what is opposite to England's love.\nTherefore to arms! be champion of our church,\nOr let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,\nA mother's curse, on her revolting son.\nFrance, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,\nA chafed lion by the mortal paw,\nA fasting tiger safer by the tooth,\nThan keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.\nKING PHILIP\nI may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nSo makest thou faith an enemy to faith;\nAnd like a civil war set'st oath to oath,\nThy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow\nFirst made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,\nThat is, to be the champion of our church!\nWhat since thou sworest is sworn against thyself\nAnd may not be performed by thyself,\nFor that which thou hast sworn to do amiss\nIs not amiss when it is truly done,\nAnd being not done, where doing tends to ill,\nThe truth is then most done not doing it:\nThe better act of purposes mistook\nIs to mistake again; though indirect,\nYet indirection thereby grows direct,\nAnd falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire\nWithin the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.\nIt is religion that doth make vows kept;\nBut thou hast sworn against religion,\nBy what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,\nAnd makest an oath the surety for thy truth\nAgainst an oath: the truth thou art unsure\nTo swear, swears only not to be forsworn;\nElse what a mockery should it be to swear!\nBut thou dost swear only to be forsworn;\nAnd most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.\nTherefore thy later vows against thy first\nIs in thyself rebellion to thyself;\nAnd better conquest never canst thou make\nThan arm thy constant and thy nobler parts\nAgainst these giddy loose suggestions:\nUpon which better part our prayers come in,\nIf thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know\nThe peril of our curses light on thee\nSo heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,\nBut in despair die under their black weight.\nAUSTRIA\nRebellion, flat rebellion!\nBASTARD\nWill't not be?\nWill not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?\nLEWIS\nFather, to arms!\nBLANCH\nUpon thy wedding-day?\nAgainst the blood that thou hast married?\nWhat, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?\nShall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,\nClamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?\nO husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new\nIs husband in my mouth! even for that name,\nWhich till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,\nUpon my knee I beg, go not to arms\nAgainst mine uncle.\nCONSTANCE\nO, upon my knee,\nMade hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,\nThou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom\nForethought by heaven!\nBLANCH\nNow shall I see thy love: what motive may\nBe stronger with thee than the name of wife?\nCONSTANCE\nThat which upholdeth him that thee upholds,\nHis honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!\nLEWIS\nI muse your majesty doth seem so cold,\nWhen such profound respects do pull you on.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nI will denounce a curse upon his head.\nKING PHILIP\nThou shalt not need.

The bastard Faulconbridge\nIs now in England, ransacking the church,\nOffending charity: if but a dozen French\nWere there in arms, they would be as a call\nTo train ten thousand English to their side,\nOr as a little snow, tumbled about,\nAnon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,\nGo with me to the king: 'tis wonderful\nWhat may be wrought out of their discontent,\nNow that their souls are topful of offence.\nFor England go: I will whet on the king.\nLEWIS\nStrong reasons make strong actions: let us go:\nIf you say ay, the king will not say no.\nExeunt"

KING JOHN'S palace.\nEnter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords\nKING JOHN\nHere once again we sit, once again crown'd,\nAnd looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.\nPEMBROKE\nThis 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,\nWas once superfluous: you were crown'd before,\nAnd that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,\nThe faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;\nFresh expectation troubled not the land\nWith any long'd-for change or better state.\nSALISBURY\nTherefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,\nTo guard a title that was rich before,\nTo gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\nTo throw a perfume on the violet,\nTo smooth the ice, or add another hue\nUnto the rainbow, or with taper-light\nTo seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\nIs wasteful and ridiculous excess.\nPEMBROKE\nBut that your royal pleasure must be done,\nThis act is as an ancient tale new told,\nAnd in the last repeating troublesome,\nBeing urged at a time unseasonable.\nSALISBURY\nIn this the antique and well noted face\nOf plain old form is much disfigured;\nAnd, like a shifted wind unto a sail,\nIt makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,\nStartles and frights consideration,\nMakes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,\nFor putting on so new a fashion'd robe.\nPEMBROKE\nWhen workmen strive to do better than well,\nThey do confound their skill in covetousness;\nAnd oftentimes excusing of a fault\nDoth make the fault the worse by the excuse,\nAs patches set upon a little breach\nDiscredit more in hiding of the fault\nThan did the fault before it was so patch'd.\nSALISBURY\nTo this effect, before you were new crown'd,\nWe breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness\nTo overbear it, and we are all well pleased,\nSince all and every part of what we would\nDoth make a stand at what your highness will.\nKING JOHN\nSome reasons of this double coronation\nI have possess'd you with and think them strong;\nAnd more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,\nI shall indue you with: meantime but ask\nWhat you would have reform'd that is not well,\nAnd well shall you perceive how willingly\nI will both hear and grant you your requests.\nPEMBROKE\nThen I, as one that am the tongue of these,\nTo sound the purpose of all their hearts,\nBoth for myself and them, but, chief of all,\nYour safety, for the which myself and them\nBend their best studies, heartily request\nThe enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint\nDoth move the murmuring lips of discontent\nTo break into this dangerous argument,--\nIf what in rest you have in right you hold,\nWhy then your fears, which, as they say, attend\nThe steps of wrong, should move you to mew up\nYour tender kinsman and to choke his days\nWith barbarous ignorance and deny his youth\nThe rich advantage of good exercise?\nThat the time's enemies may not have this\nTo grace occasions, let it be our suit\nThat you have bid us ask his liberty;\nWhich for our goods we do no further ask\nThan whereupon our weal, on you depending,\nCounts it your weal he have his liberty.\nEnter HUBERT\n\nKING JOHN\nLet it be so: I do commit his youth\nTo your direction. Hubert, what news with you?\nTaking him apart\n\nPEMBROKE\nThis is the man should do the bloody deed;\nHe show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:\nThe image of a wicked heinous fault\nLives in his eye; that close aspect of his\nDoes show the mood of a much troubled breast;\nAnd I do fearfully believe 'tis done,\nWhat we so fear'd he had a charge to do.\nSALISBURY\nThe colour of the king doth come and go\nBetween his purpose and his conscience,\nLike heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:\nHis passion is so ripe, it needs must break.\nPEMBROKE\nAnd when it breaks, I fear will issue thence\nThe foul corruption of a sweet child's death.\nKING JOHN\nWe cannot hold mortality's strong hand:\nGood lords, although my will to give is living,\nThe suit which you demand is gone and dead:\nHe tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.\nSALISBURY\nIndeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.\nPEMBROKE\nIndeed we heard how near his death he was\nBefore the child himself felt he was sick:\nThis must be answer'd either here or hence.\nKING JOHN\nWhy do you bend such solemn brows on me?\nThink you I bear the shears of destiny?\nHave I commandment on the pulse of life?\nSALISBURY\nIt is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame\nThat greatness should so grossly offer it:\nSo thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.\nPEMBROKE\nStay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,\nAnd find the inheritance of this poor child,\nHis little kingdom of a forced grave.\nThat blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,\nThree foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!\nThis must not be thus borne: this will break out\nTo all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.\nExeunt Lords\n\nKING JOHN\nThey burn in indignation. I repent:\nThere is no sure foundation set on blood,\nNo certain life achieved by others' death.\nEnter a Messenger\n\nA fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood\nThat I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?\nSo foul a sky clears not without a storm:\nPour down thy weather: how goes all in France?\nMessenger\nFrom France to England. Never such a power\nFor any foreign preparation\nWas levied in the body of a land.\nThe copy of your speed is learn'd by them;\nFor when you should be told they do prepare,\nThe tidings come that they are all arrived.\nKING JOHN\nO, where hath our intelligence been drunk?\nWhere hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,\nThat such an army could be drawn in France,\nAnd she not hear of it?\nMessenger\nMy liege, her ear\nIs stopp'd with dust; the first of April died\nYour noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,\nThe Lady Constance in a frenzy died\nThree days before: but this from rumour's tongue\nI idly heard; if true or false I know not.\nKING JOHN\nWithhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!\nO, make a league with me, till I have pleased\nMy discontented peers! What! mother dead!\nHow wildly then walks my estate in France!\nUnder whose conduct came those powers of France\nThat thou for truth givest out are landed here?\nMessenger\nUnder the Dauphin.\nKING JOHN\nThou hast made me giddy\nWith these ill tidings.\nEnter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret\n\nNow, what says the world\nTo your proceedings? do not seek to stuff\nMy head with more ill news, for it is full.\nBASTARD\nBut if you be afeard to hear the worst,\nThen let the worst unheard fall on your bead.\nKING JOHN\nBear with me cousin, for I was amazed\nUnder the tide: but now I breathe again\nAloft the flood, and can give audience\nTo any tongue, speak it of what it will.\nBASTARD\nHow I have sped among the clergymen,\nThe sums I have collected shall express.\nBut as I travell'd hither through the land,\nI find the people strangely fantasied;\nPossess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,\nNot knowing what they fear, but full of fear:\nAnd here a prophet, that I brought with me\nFrom forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found\nWith many hundreds treading on his heels;\nTo whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,\nThat, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,\nYour highness should deliver up your crown.\nKING JOHN\nThou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?\nPETER\nForeknowing that the truth will fall out so.\nKING JOHN\nHubert, away with him; imprison him;\nAnd on that day at noon whereon he says\nI shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.\nDeliver him to safety; and return,\nFor I must use thee.\nExeunt HUBERT with PETER\n\nO my gentle cousin,\nHear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?\nBASTARD\nThe French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:\nBesides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,\nWith eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,\nAnd others more, going to seek the grave\nOf Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night\nOn your suggestion.\nKING JOHN\nGentle kinsman, go,\nAnd thrust thyself into their companies:\nI have a way to win their loves again;\nBring them before me.\nBASTARD\nI will seek them out.\nKING JOHN\nNay, but make haste; the better foot before.\nO, let me have no subject enemies,\nWhen adverse foreigners affright my towns\nWith dreadful pomp of stout invasion!\nBe Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,\nAnd fly like thought from them to me again.\nBASTARD\nThe spirit of the time shall teach me speed.\nExit\n\nKING JOHN\nSpoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.\nGo after him; for he perhaps shall need\nSome messenger betwixt me and the peers;\nAnd be thou he.\nMessenger\nWith all my heart, my liege.\nExit\n\nKING JOHN\nMy mother dead!\nRe-enter HUBERT\n\nHUBERT\nMy lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;\nFour fixed, and the fifth did whirl about\nThe other four in wondrous motion.\nKING JOHN\nFive moons!\nHUBERT\nOld men and beldams in the streets\nDo prophesy upon it dangerously:\nYoung Arthur's death is common in their mouths:\nAnd when they talk of him, they shake their heads\nAnd whisper one another in the ear;\nAnd he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,\nWhilst he that hears makes fearful action,\nWith wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.\nI saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,\nThe whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,\nWith open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;\nWho, with his shears and measure in his hand,\nStanding on slippers, which his nimble haste\nHad falsely thrust upon contrary feet,\nTold of a many thousand warlike French\nThat were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:\nAnother lean unwash'd artificer\nCuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.\nKING JOHN\nWhy seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?\nWhy urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?\nThy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause\nTo wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.\nHUBERT\nNo had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?\nKING JOHN\nIt is the curse of kings to be attended\nBy slaves that take their humours for a warrant\nTo break within the bloody house of life,\nAnd on the winking of authority\nTo understand a law, to know the meaning\nOf dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns\nMore upon humour than advised respect.\nHUBERT\nHere is your hand and seal for what I did.\nKING JOHN\nO, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth\nIs to be made, then shall this hand and seal\nWitness against us to damnation!\nHow oft the sight of means to do ill deeds\nMake deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,\nA fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,\nQuoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,\nThis murder had not come into my mind:\nBut taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,\nFinding thee fit for bloody villany,\nApt, liable to be employ'd in danger,\nI faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;\nAnd thou, to be endeared to a king,\nMade it no conscience to destroy a prince.\nHUBERT\nMy lord--\nKING JOHN\nHadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause\nWhen I spake darkly what I purposed,\nOr turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,\nAs bid me tell my tale in express words,\nDeep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,\nAnd those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:\nBut thou didst understand me by my signs\nAnd didst in signs again parley with sin;\nYea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,\nAnd consequently thy rude hand to act\nThe deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.\nOut of my sight, and never see me more!\nMy nobles leave me; and my state is braved,\nEven at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:\nNay, in the body of this fleshly land,\nThis kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,\nHostility and civil tumult reigns\nBetween my conscience and my cousin's death.\nHUBERT\nArm you against your other enemies,\nI'll make a peace between your soul and you.\nYoung Arthur is alive: this hand of mine\nIs yet a maiden and an innocent hand,\nNot painted with the crimson spots of blood.\nWithin this bosom never enter'd yet\nThe dreadful motion of a murderous thought;\nAnd you have slander'd nature in my form,\nWhich, howsoever rude exteriorly,\nIs yet the cover of a fairer mind\nThan to be butcher of an innocent child.\nKING JOHN\nDoth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,\nThrow this report on their incensed rage,\nAnd make them tame to their obedience!\nForgive the comment that my passion made\nUpon thy feature; for my rage was blind,\nAnd foul imaginary eyes of blood\nPresented thee more hideous than thou art.\nO, answer not, but to my closet bring\nThe angry lords with all expedient haste.\nI conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.\nExeunt",

    "content":"SCENE III. Before the castle.\nEnter ARTHUR, on the walls\nARTHUR\nThe wall is high, and yet will I leap down:\nGood ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!\nThere's few or none do know me: if they did,\nThis ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.\nI am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.\nIf I get down, and do not break my limbs,\nI'll find a thousand shifts to get away:\nAs good to die and go, as die and stay.\nLeaps down\n\nO me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:\nHeaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!\nDies\n\nEnter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT\n\nSALISBURY\nLords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:\nIt is our safety, and we must embrace\nThis gentle offer of the perilous time.\nPEMBROKE\nWho brought that letter from the cardinal?\nSALISBURY\nThe Count Melun, a noble lord of France,\nWhose private with me of the Dauphin's love\nIs much more general than these lines import.\nBIGOT\nTo-morrow morning let us meet him then.\nSALISBURY\nOr rather then set forward; for 'twill be\nTwo long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.\nEnter the BASTARD\n\nBASTARD\nOnce more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!\nThe king by me requests your presence straight.\nSALISBURY\nThe king hath dispossess'd himself of us:\nWe will not line his thin bestained cloak\nWith our pure honours, nor attend the foot\nThat leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.\nReturn and tell him so: we know the worst.\nBASTARD\nWhate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.\nSALISBURY\nOur griefs, and not our manners, reason now.\nBASTARD\nBut there is little reason in your grief;\nTherefore 'twere reason you had manners now.\nPEMBROKE\nSir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.\nBASTARD\n'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.\nSALISBURY\nThis is the prison. What is he lies here?\nSeeing ARTHUR\n\nPEMBROKE\nO death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!\nThe earth had not a hole to hide this deed.\nSALISBURY\nMurder, as hating what himself hath done,\nDoth lay it open to urge on revenge.\nBIGOT\nOr, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,\nFound it too precious-princely for a grave.\nSALISBURY\nSir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,\nOr have you read or heard? or could you think?\nOr do you almost think, although you see,\nThat you do see? could thought, without this object,\nForm such another? This is the very top,\nThe height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,\nOf murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,\nThe wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,\nThat ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage\nPresented to the tears of soft remorse.\nPEMBROKE\nAll murders past do stand excused in this:\nAnd this, so sole and so unmatchable,\nShall give a holiness, a purity,\nTo the yet unbegotten sin of times;\nAnd prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,\nExampled by this heinous spectacle.\nBASTARD\nIt is a damned and a bloody work;\nThe graceless action of a heavy hand,\nIf that it be the work of any hand.\nSALISBURY\nIf that it be the work of any hand!\nWe had a kind of light what would ensue:\nIt is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;\nThe practise and the purpose of the king:\nFrom whose obedience I forbid my soul,\nKneeling before this ruin of sweet life,\nAnd breathing to his breathless excellence\nThe incense of a vow, a holy vow,\nNever to taste the pleasures of the world,\nNever to be infected with delight,\nNor conversant with ease and idleness,\nTill I have set a glory to this hand,\nBy giving it the worship of revenge.\nPEMBROKE BIGOT\nOur souls religiously confirm thy words.\nEnter HUBERT\n\nHUBERT\nLords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:\nArthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.\nSALISBURY\nO, he is old and blushes not at death.\nAvaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!\nHUBERT\nI am no villain.\nSALISBURY\nMust I rob the law?\nDrawing his sword\n\nBASTARD\nYour sword is bright, sir; put it up again.\nSALISBURY\nNot till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.\nHUBERT\nStand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;\nBy heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:\nI would not have you, lord, forget yourself,\nNor tempt the danger of my true defence;\nLest I, by marking of your rage, forget\nYour worth, your greatness and nobility.\nBIGOT\nOut, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?\nHUBERT\nNot for my life: but yet I dare defend\nMy innocent life against an emperor.\nSALISBURY\nThou art a murderer.\nHUBERT\nDo not prove me so;\nYet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,\nNot truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.\nPEMBROKE\nCut him to pieces.\nBASTARD\nKeep the peace, I say.\nSALISBURY\nStand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.\nBASTARD\nThou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:\nIf thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,\nOr teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,\nI'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;\nOr I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,\nThat you shall think the devil is come from hell.\nBIGOT\nWhat wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?\nSecond a villain and a murderer?\nHUBERT\nLord Bigot, I am none.\nBIGOT\nWho kill'd this prince?\nHUBERT\n'Tis not an hour since I left him well:\nI honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep\nMy date of life out for his sweet life's loss.\nSALISBURY\nTrust not those cunning waters of his eyes,\nFor villany is not without such rheum;\nAnd he, long traded in it, makes it seem\nLike rivers of remorse and innocency.\nAway with me, all you whose souls abhor\nThe uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;\nFor I am stifled with this smell of sin.\nBIGOT\nAway toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!\nPEMBROKE\nThere tell the king he may inquire us out.\nExeunt Lords\n\nBASTARD\nHere's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?\nBeyond the infinite and boundless reach\nOf mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,\nArt thou damn'd, Hubert.\nHUBERT\nDo but hear me, sir.\nBASTARD\nHa! I'll tell thee what;\nThou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;\nThou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:\nThere is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell\nAs thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.\nHUBERT\nUpon my soul--\nBASTARD\nIf thou didst but consent\nTo this most cruel act, do but despair;\nAnd if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread\nThat ever spider twisted from her womb\nWill serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam\nTo hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,\nPut but a little water in a spoon,\nAnd it shall be as all the ocean,\nEnough to stifle such a villain up.\nI do suspect thee very grievously.\nHUBERT\nIf I in act, consent, or sin of thought,\nBe guilty of the stealing that sweet breath\nWhich was embounded in this beauteous clay,\nLet hell want pains enough to torture me.\nI left him well.\nBASTARD\nGo, bear him in thine arms.\nI am amazed, methinks, and lose my way\nAmong the thorns and dangers of this world.\nHow easy dost thou take all England up!\nFrom forth this morsel of dead royalty,\nThe life, the right and truth of all this realm\nIs fled to heaven; and England now is left\nTo tug and scamble and to part by the teeth\nThe unowed interest of proud-swelling state.\nNow for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty\nDoth dogged war bristle his angry crest\nAnd snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:\nNow powers from home and discontents at home\nMeet in one line; and vast confusion waits,\nAs doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,\nThe imminent decay of wrested pomp.\nNow happy he whose cloak and cincture can\nHold out this tempest. Bear away that child\nAnd follow me with speed: I'll to the king:\nA thousand businesses are brief in hand,\nAnd heaven itself doth frown upon the land.\nExeunt"

O, it grieves my soul,\nThat I must draw this metal from my side\nTo be a widow-maker! O, and there\nWhere honourable rescue and defence\nCries out upon the name of Salisbury!\nBut such is the infection of the time,\nThat, for the health and physic of our right,\nWe cannot deal but with the very hand\nOf stern injustice and confused wrong.\nAnd is't not pity, O my grieved friends,\nThat we, the sons and children of this isle,\nWere born to see so sad an hour as this;\nWherein we step after a stranger march\nUpon her gentle bosom, and fill up\nHer enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep\nUpon the spot of this enforced cause,--\nTo grace the gentry of a land remote,\nAnd follow unacquainted colours here?\nWhat, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!\nThat Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,\nWould bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,\nAnd grapple thee unto a pagan shore;\nWhere these two Christian armies might combine\nThe blood of malice in a vein of league,\nAnd not to spend it so unneighbourly!\nLEWIS\nA noble temper dost thou show in this;\nAnd great affections wrestling in thy bosom\nDoth make an earthquake of nobility.\nO, what a noble combat hast thou fought\nBetween compulsion and a brave respect!\nLet me wipe off this honourable dew,\nThat silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:\nMy heart hath melted at a lady's tears,\nBeing an ordinary inundation;\nBut this effusion of such manly drops,\nThis shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,\nStartles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed\nThan had I seen the vaulty top of heaven\nFigured quite o'er with burning meteors.\nLift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,\nAnd with a great heart heave away the storm:\nCommend these waters to those baby eyes\nThat never saw the giant world enraged;\nNor met with fortune other than at feasts,\nFull of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.\nCome, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep\nInto the purse of rich prosperity\nAs Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,\nThat knit your sinews to the strength of mine.\nAnd even there, methinks, an angel spake:\nEnter CARDINAL PANDULPH\n\nLook, where the holy legate comes apace,\nTo give us warrant from the hand of heaven\nAnd on our actions set the name of right\nWith holy breath.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nHail, noble prince of France!\nThe next is this, King John hath reconciled\nHimself to Rome; his spirit is come in,\nThat so stood out against the holy church,\nThe great metropolis and see of Rome:\nTherefore thy threatening colours now wind up;\nAnd tame the savage spirit of wild war,\nThat like a lion foster'd up at hand,\nIt may lie gently at the foot of peace,\nAnd be no further harmful than in show.\nLEWIS\nYour grace shall pardon me, I will not back:\nI am too high-born to be propertied,\nTo be a secondary at control,\nOr useful serving-man and instrument,\nTo any sovereign state throughout the world.\nYour breath first kindled the dead coal of wars\nBetween this chastised kingdom and myself,\nAnd brought in matter that should feed this fire;\nAnd now 'tis far too huge to be blown out\nWith that same weak wind which enkindled it.\nYou taught me how to know the face of right,\nAcquainted me with interest to this land,\nYea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;\nAnd come ye now to tell me John hath made\nHis peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?\nI, by the honour of my marriage-bed,\nAfter young Arthur, claim this land for mine;\nAnd, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back\nBecause that John hath made his peace with Rome?\nAm I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,\nWhat men provided, what munition sent,\nTo underprop this action? Is't not I\nThat undergo this charge? who else but I,\nAnd such as to my claim are liable,\nSweat in this business and maintain this war?\nHave I not heard these islanders shout out\n'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?\nHave I not here the best cards for the game,\nTo win this easy match play'd for a crown?\nAnd shall I now give o'er the yielded set?\nNo, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nYou look but on the outside of this work.\nLEWIS\nOutside or inside, I will not return\nTill my attempt so much be glorified\nAs to my ample hope was promised\nBefore I drew this gallant head of war,\nAnd cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,\nTo outlook conquest and to win renown\nEven in the jaws of danger and of death.\nTrumpet sounds\n\nWhat lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?\nEnter the BASTARD, attended\n\nBASTARD\nAccording to the fair play of the world,\nLet me have audience; I am sent to speak:\nMy holy lord of Milan, from the king\nI come, to learn how you have dealt for him;\nAnd, as you answer, I do know the scope\nAnd warrant limited unto my tongue.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nThe Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,\nAnd will not temporize with my entreaties;\nHe flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.\nBASTARD\nBy all the blood that ever fury breathed,\nThe youth says well. Now hear our English king;\nFor thus his royalty doth speak in me.\nHe is prepared, and reason too he should:\nThis apish and unmannerly approach,\nThis harness'd masque and unadvised revel,\nThis unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,\nThe king doth smile at; and is well prepared\nTo whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,\nFrom out the circle of his territories.\nThat hand which had the strength, even at your door,\nTo cudgel you and make you take the hatch,\nTo dive like buckets in concealed wells,\nTo crouch in litter of your stable planks,\nTo lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,\nTo hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out\nIn vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake\nEven at the crying of your nation's crow,\nThinking his voice an armed Englishman;\nShall that victorious hand be feebled here,\nThat in your chambers gave you chastisement?\nNo: know the gallant monarch is in arms\nAnd like an eagle o'er his aery towers,\nTo souse annoyance that comes near his nest.\nAnd you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,\nYou bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb\nOf your dear mother England, blush for shame;\nFor your own ladies and pale-visaged maids\nLike Amazons come tripping after drums,\nTheir thimbles into armed gauntlets change,\nTheir needles to lances, and their gentle hearts\nTo fierce and bloody inclination.\nLEWIS\nThere end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;\nWe grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;\nWe hold our time too precious to be spent\nWith such a brabbler.\nCARDINAL PANDULPH\nGive me leave to speak.\nBASTARD\nNo, I will speak.\nLEWIS\nWe will attend to neither.\nStrike up the drums; and let the tongue of war\nPlead for our interest and our being here.\nBASTARD\nIndeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;\nAnd so shall you, being beaten: do but start\nAn echo with the clamour of thy drum,\nAnd even at hand a drum is ready braced\nThat shall reverberate all as loud as thine;\nSound but another, and another shall\nAs loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear\nAnd mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,\nNot trusting to this halting legate here,\nWhom he hath used rather for sport than need\nIs warlike John; and in his forehead sits\nA bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day\nTo feast upon whole thousands of the French.\nLEWIS\nStrike up our drums, to find this danger out.\nBASTARD\nAnd thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.\nExeunt",
