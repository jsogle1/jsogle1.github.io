    "title":"Act I Scene I: Before Leonato’s House",
    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.\nEnter Leonato, Hero, Beatrice and others, with a Messenger.\n\nLEONATO.\nI learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.\n\nLEONATO.\nHow many gentlemen have you lost in this action?\n\nMESSENGER.\nBut few of any sort, and none of name.\n\nLEONATO.\nA victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMuch deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.\n\nLEONATO.\nHe hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.\n\nMESSENGER.\nI have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.\n\nLEONATO.\nDid he break out into tears?\n\nMESSENGER.\nIn great measure.\n\nLEONATO.\nA kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!\n\nBEATRICE.\nI pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?\n\nMESSENGER.\nI know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army of any sort.\n\nLEONATO.\nWhat is he that you ask for, niece?\n\nHERO.\nMy cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.\n\nMESSENGER.\nO! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.\n\nBEATRICE.\nHe set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight; and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing.\n\nLEONATO.\nFaith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe hath done good service, lady, in these wars.\n\nBEATRICE.\nYou had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it; he is a very valiant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.\n\nMESSENGER.\nAnd a good soldier too, lady.\n\nBEATRICE.\nAnd a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?\n\nMESSENGER.\nA lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable virtues.\n\nBEATRICE.\nIt is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the stuffing,—well, we are all mortal.\n\nLEONATO.\nYou must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.\n\nBEATRICE.\nAlas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.\n\nMESSENGER.\nIs’t possible?\n\nBEATRICE.\nVery easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.\n\nMESSENGER.\nI see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.\n\nBEATRICE.\nNo; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.\n\nBEATRICE.\nO Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.\n\nMESSENGER.\nI will hold friends with you, lady.\n\nBEATRICE.\nDo, good friend.\n\nLEONATO.\nYou will never run mad, niece.\n\nBEATRICE.\nNo, not till a hot January.\n\nMESSENGER.\nDon Pedro is approached.\n\nEnter Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar and Others.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nGood Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.\n\nLEONATO.\nNever came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYou embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.\n\nLEONATO.\nHer mother hath many times told me so.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWere you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?\n\nLEONATO.\nSignior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYou have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honourable father.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIf Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.\n\nBEATRICE.\nI wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody marks you.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWhat! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?\n\nBEATRICE.\nIs it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThen is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.\n\nBEATRICE.\nA dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.\n\nBENEDICK.\nGod keep your Ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.\n\nBEATRICE.\nScratching could not make it worse, and ’twere such a face as yours were.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWell, you are a rare parrot-teacher.\n\nBEATRICE.\nA bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i’ God’s name; I have done.\n\nBEATRICE.\nYou always end with a jade’s trick: I know you of old.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThat is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.\n\nLEONATO.\nIf you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [To Don John] Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.\n\nDON JOHN.\nI thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you.\n\nLEONATO.\nPlease it your Grace lead on?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYour hand, Leonato; we will go together.\n\n[Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio.]\n\nCLAUDIO.\nBenedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?\n\nBENEDICK.\nI noted her not; but I looked on her.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIs she not a modest young lady?\n\nBENEDICK.\nDo you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNo; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWhy, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWould you buy her, that you enquire after her?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nCan the world buy such a jewel?\n\nBENEDICK.\nYea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIn mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there’s her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIs’t come to this, in faith? Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith; and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.\n\nRe-enter Don Pedro.\n\nLook! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhat secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonato’s?\n\nBENEDICK.\nI would your Grace would constrain me to tell.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI charge thee on thy allegiance.\n\nBENEDICK.\nYou hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance mark you this, on my allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf this were so, so were it uttered.\n\nBENEDICK.\nLike the old tale, my lord: ‘it is not so, nor ’twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so.’\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAmen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYou speak this to fetch me in, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBy my troth, I speak my thought.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.\n\nBENEDICK.\nAnd by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThat I love her, I feel.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThat she is worthy, I know.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThat I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThat a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,—for the which I may go the finer,—I will live a bachelor.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWith anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWell, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIf I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWell, as time shall try: ‘In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.’\n\nBENEDICK.\nThe savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead; and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, ‘Here is good horse to hire,’ let them signify under my sign ‘Here you may see Benedick the married man.’\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nNay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI look for an earthquake too then.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWell, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s: commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great preparation.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit you—\n\nCLAUDIO.\nTo the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,—\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThe sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick.\n\nBENEDICK.\nNay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I leave you.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCLAUDIO.\nMy liege, your Highness now may do me good.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nMy love is thine to teach: teach it but how,\nAnd thou shalt see how apt it is to learn\nAny hard lesson that may do thee good.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nHath Leonato any son, my lord?\nDON PEDRO.\nNo child but Hero; she’s his only heir.\nDost thou affect her, Claudio?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO! my lord,\nWhen you went onward on this ended action,\nI looked upon her with a soldier’s eye,\nThat lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand\nThan to drive liking to the name of love;\nBut now I am return’d, and that war-thoughts\nHave left their places vacant, in their rooms\nCome thronging soft and delicate desires,\nAll prompting me how fair young Hero is,\nSaying, I lik’d her ere I went to wars.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThou wilt be like a lover presently,\nAnd tire the hearer with a book of words.\nIf thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,\nAnd I will break with her, and with her father,\nAnd thou shalt have her. Was’t not to this end\nThat thou began’st to twist so fine a story?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nHow sweetly you do minister to love,\nThat know love’s grief by his complexion!\nBut lest my liking might too sudden seem,\nI would have salv’d it with a longer treatise.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhat need the bridge much broader than the flood?\nThe fairest grant is the necessity.\nLook, what will serve is fit: ’tis once, thou lov’st,\nAnd I will fit thee with the remedy.\nI know we shall have revelling tonight:\nI will assume thy part in some disguise,\nAnd tell fair Hero I am Claudio;\nAnd in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart,\nAnd take her hearing prisoner with the force\nAnd strong encounter of my amorous tale:\nThen after to her father will I break;\nAnd the conclusion is, she shall be thine.\nIn practice let us put it presently.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. Another room in Leonato’s house.\nEnter Don John and Conrade.\n\nCONRADE.\nWhat the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad?\n\nDON JOHN.\nThere is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the sadness is without limit.\n\nCONRADE.\nYou should hear reason.\n\nDON JOHN.\nAnd when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?\n\nCONRADE.\nIf not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.\n\nDON JOHN.\nI wonder that thou (being as thou say’st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour.\n\nCONRADE.\nYea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace; where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.\n\nDON JOHN.\nI had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.\n\nCONRADE.\nCan you make no use of your discontent?\n\nDON JOHN.\nI make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?\n\nEnter Borachio.\n\nWhat news, Borachio?\n\nBORACHIO.\nI came yonder from a great supper: the Prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.\n\nDON JOHN.\nWill it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?\n\nBORACHIO.\nMarry, it is your brother’s right hand.\n\nDON JOHN.\nWho? the most exquisite Claudio?\n\nBORACHIO.\nEven he.\n\nDON JOHN.\nA proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he?\n\nBORACHIO.\nMarry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.\n\nDON JOHN.\nA very forward March-chick! How came you to this?\n\nBORACHIO.\nBeing entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.\n\nDON JOHN.\nCome, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?\n\nCONRADE.\nTo the death, my lord.\n\nDON JOHN.\nLet us to the great supper: their cheer is the greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of my mind! Shall we go to prove what’s to be done?\n\nBORACHIO.\nWe’ll wait upon your Lordship.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A hall in Leonato’s house.\nEnter Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice and others.\n\nLEONATO.\nWas not Count John here at supper?\n\nANTONIO.\nI saw him not.\n\nBEATRICE.\nHow tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after.\n\nHERO.\nHe is of a very melancholy disposition.\n\nBEATRICE.\nHe were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing; and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.\n\nLEONATO.\nThen half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s face—\n\nBEATRICE.\nWith a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world if a’ could get her good will.\n\nLEONATO.\nBy my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.\n\nANTONIO.\nIn faith, she’s too curst.\n\nBEATRICE.\nToo curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God’s sending that way; for it is said, ‘God sends a curst cow short horns;’ but to a cow too curst he sends none.\n\nLEONATO.\nSo, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?\n\nBEATRICE.\nJust, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.\n\nLEONATO.\nYou may light on a husband that hath no beard.\n\nBEATRICE.\nWhat should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.\n\nLEONATO.\nWell then, go you into hell?\n\nBEATRICE.\nNo; but to the gate; and there will the Devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, ‘Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.’ So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens: he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.\n\nANTONIO.\n[To Hero.] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.\n\nBEATRICE.\nYes, faith; it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please you:’— but yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please me.’\n\nLEONATO.\nWell, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.\n\nBEATRICE.\nNot till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none: Adam’s sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.\n\nLEONATO.\nDaughter, remember what I told you: if the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.\n\nBEATRICE.\nThe fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time: if the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and with his bad legs, falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.\n\nLEONATO.\nCousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.\n\nBEATRICE.\nI have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight.\n\nLEONATO.\nThe revellers are entering, brother: make good room.\n\nEnter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, Don John, Borachio, Margaret, Ursula and Others, masked.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nLady, will you walk about with your friend?\n\nHERO.\nSo you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWith me in your company?\n\nHERO.\nI may say so, when I please.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAnd when please you to say so?\n\nHERO.\nWhen I like your favour; for God defend the lute should be like the case!\n\nDON PEDRO.\nMy visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house is Jove.\n\nHERO.\nWhy, then, your visor should be thatch’d.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nSpeak low, if you speak love.\n\n[Takes her aside.]\n\nBALTHASAR.\nWell, I would you did like me.\n\nMARGARET.\nSo would not I, for your own sake; for I have many ill qualities.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nWhich is one?\n\nMARGARET.\nI say my prayers aloud.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nI love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen.\n\nMARGARET.\nGod match me with a good dancer!\n\nBALTHASAR.\nAmen.\n\nMARGARET.\nAnd God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer, clerk.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nNo more words: the clerk is answered.\n\nURSULA.\nI know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio.\n\nANTONIO.\nAt a word, I am not.\n\nURSULA.\nI know you by the waggling of your head.\n\nANTONIO.\nTo tell you true, I counterfeit him.\n\nURSULA.\nYou could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man. Here’s his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.\n\nANTONIO.\nAt a word, I am not.\n\nURSULA.\nCome, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there’s an end.\n\nBEATRICE.\nWill you not tell me who told you so?\n\nBENEDICK.\nNo, you shall pardon me.\n\nBEATRICE.\nNor will you not tell me who you are?\n\nBENEDICK.\nNot now.\n\nBEATRICE.\nThat I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the ‘Hundred Merry Tales.’ Well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWhat’s he?\n\nBEATRICE.\nI am sure you know him well enough.\n\nBENEDICK.\nNot I, believe me.\n\nBEATRICE.\nDid he never make you laugh?\n\nBENEDICK.\nI pray you, what is he?\n\nBEATRICE.\nWhy, he is the Prince’s jester: a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villainy; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me!\n\nBENEDICK.\nWhen I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.\n\nBEATRICE.\nDo, do: he’ll but break a comparison or two on me; which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy; and then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night. [Music within.] We must follow the leaders.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIn every good thing.\n\nBEATRICE.\nNay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.\n\n[Dance. Then exeunt all but Don John, Borachio and Claudio.]\n\nDON JOHN.\nSure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.\n\nBORACHIO.\nAnd that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.\n\nDON JOHN.\nAre you not Signior Benedick?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYou know me well; I am he.\n\nDON JOHN.\nSignior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no equal for his birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nHow know you he loves her?\n\nDON JOHN.\nI heard him swear his affection.\n\nBORACHIO.\nSo did I too; and he swore he would marry her tonight.\n\nDON JOHN.\nCome, let us to the banquet.\n\n[Exeunt Don John and Borachio.]\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThus answer I in name of Benedick,\nBut hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.\n’Tis certain so; the Prince woos for himself.\nFriendship is constant in all other things\nSave in the office and affairs of love:\nTherefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;\nLet every eye negotiate for itself\nAnd trust no agent; for beauty is a witch\nAgainst whose charms faith melteth into blood.\nThis is an accident of hourly proof,\nWhich I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!\n\nRe-enter Benedick.\n\nBENEDICK.\nCount Claudio?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYea, the same.\n\nBENEDICK.\nCome, will you go with me?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWhither?\n\nBENEDICK.\nEven to the next willow, about your own business, Count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer’s chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant’s scarf? You must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI wish him joy of her.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWhy, that’s spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI pray you, leave me.\n\nBENEDICK.\nHo! now you strike like the blind man: ’twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf it will not be, I’ll leave you.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBENEDICK.\nAlas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.\n\nRe-enter Don Pedro.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nNow, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see him?\n\nBENEDICK.\nTroth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nTo be whipped! What’s his fault?\n\nBENEDICK.\nThe flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy’d with finding a bird’s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.\n\nBENEDICK.\nYet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird’s nest.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIf their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThe Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.\n\nBENEDICK.\nO! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her: my very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.\n\nRe-enter Claudio, Beatrice, Hero and Leonato.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nLook! here she comes.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWill your Grace command me any service to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John’s foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Cham’s beard; do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words’ conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nNone, but to desire your good company.\n\nBENEDICK.\nO God, sir, here’s a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDON PEDRO.\nCome, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.\n\nBEATRICE.\nIndeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYou have put him down, lady, you have put him down.\n\nBEATRICE.\nSo I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhy, how now, Count! wherefore are you sad?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNot sad, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHow then? Sick?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNeither, my lord.\n\nBEATRICE.\nThe Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but civil Count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his good will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!\n\nLEONATO.\nCount, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it!\n\nBEATRICE.\nSpeak, Count, ’tis your cue.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nSilence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.\n\nBEATRICE.\nSpeak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nIn faith, lady, you have a merry heart.\n\nBEATRICE.\nYea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd so she doth, cousin.\n\nBEATRICE.\nGood Lord, for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!\n\nDON PEDRO.\nLady Beatrice, I will get you one.\n\nBEATRICE.\nI would rather have one of your father’s getting. Hath your Grace ne’er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWill you have me, lady?\n\nBEATRICE.\nNo, my lord, unless I might have another for working days: your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your Grace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYour silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for out of question, you were born in a merry hour.\n\nBEATRICE.\nNo, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!\n\nLEONATO.\nNiece, will you look to those things I told you of?\n\nBEATRICE.\nI cry you mercy, uncle. By your Grace’s pardon.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBy my troth, a pleasant spirited lady.\n\nLEONATO.\nThere’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nShe cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.\n\nLEONATO.\nO! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nShe were an excellent wife for Benedick.\n\nLEONATO.\nO Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nCount Claudio, when mean you to go to church?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nTomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.\n\nLEONATO.\nNot till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night; and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nCome, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules’ labours, which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.\n\nLEONATO.\nMy lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights’ watchings.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd I, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAnd you too, gentle Hero?\n\nHERO.\nI will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAnd Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Another room in Leonato’s house.\nEnter Don John and Borachio.\n\nDON JOHN.\nIt is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.\n\nBORACHIO.\nYea, my lord; but I can cross it.\n\nDON JOHN.\nAny bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?\n\nBORACHIO.\nNot honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.\n\nDON JOHN.\nShow me briefly how.\n\nBORACHIO.\nI think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.\n\nDON JOHN.\nI remember.\n\nBORACHIO.\nI can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.\n\nDON JOHN.\nWhat life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?\n\nBORACHIO.\nThe poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio,—whose estimation do you mightily hold up,—to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.\n\nDON JOHN.\nWhat proof shall I make of that?\n\nBORACHIO.\nProof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?\n\nDON JOHN.\nOnly to despite them, I will endeavour anything.\n\nBORACHIO.\nGo then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as—in love of your brother’s honour, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,—that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent; and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty, that jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.\n\nDON JOHN.\nGrow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.\n\nBORACHIO.\nBe you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.\n\nDON JOHN.\nI will presently go learn their day of marriage.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

I have known, when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe: I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.\n\n[Withdraws.]\n\nEnter Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio, followed by Balthasar and Musicians.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nCome, shall we hear this music?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYea, my good lord. How still the evening is,\nAs hush’d on purpose to grace harmony!\n\nDON PEDRO.\nSee you where Benedick hath hid himself?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO! very well, my lord: the music ended,\nWe’ll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nCome, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nO! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice\nTo slander music any more than once.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nIt is the witness still of excellency,\nTo put a strange face on his own perfection.\nI pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nBecause you talk of wooing, I will sing;\nSince many a wooer doth commence his suit\nTo her he thinks not worthy; yet he wooes;\nYet will he swear he loves.\nDON PEDRO.\nNay, pray thee come;\nOr if thou wilt hold longer argument,\nDo it in notes.\nBALTHASAR.\nNote this before my notes;\nThere’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhy these are very crotchets that he speaks;\nNotes, notes, forsooth, and nothing!\n\n[Music.]\n\nBENEDICK.\nNow, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it not strange that sheep’s guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when all’s done.\n\nBALTHASAR [sings.]\n   Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,\n     Men were deceivers ever;\n   One foot in sea, and one on shore,\n     To one thing constant never.\n       Then sigh not so, but let them go,\n     And be you blithe and bonny,\n   Converting all your sounds of woe\n     Into Hey nonny, nonny.\n\n   Sing no more ditties, sing no mo\n     Of dumps so dull and heavy;\n   The fraud of men was ever so,\n     Since summer first was leavy.\n       Then sigh not so, but let them go,\n     And be you blithe and bonny,\n   Converting all your sounds of woe\n     Into Hey nonny, nonny.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBy my troth, a good song.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nAnd an ill singer, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHa, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.\n\nBENEDICK.\n[Aside] And he had been a dog that should have howled thus, they would have hanged him; and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the night-raven, come what plague could have come after it.\n\nDON PEDRO. Yea, marry; dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber window.\n\nBALTHASAR.\nThe best I can, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nDo so: farewell.\n\n[Exeunt Balthasar and Musicians.]\n\nCome hither, Leonato: what was it you told me of today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO! ay:—[Aside to Don Pedro] Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits. I did never think that lady would have loved any man.\n\nLEONATO.\nNo, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor.\n\nBENEDICK.\n[Aside] Is’t possible? Sits the wind in that corner?\n\nLEONATO.\nBy my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection: it is past the infinite of thought.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nMaybe she doth but counterfeit.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nFaith, like enough.\n\nLEONATO.\nO God! counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhy, what effects of passion shows she?\n\nCLAUDIO.\n[Aside] Bait the hook well: this fish will bite.\n\nLEONATO.\nWhat effects, my lord? She will sit you; [To Claudio] You heard my daughter tell you how.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nShe did, indeed.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHow, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.\n\nLEONATO.\nI would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick.\n\nBENEDICK.\n[Aside] I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, sure, hide itself in such reverence.\n\nCLAUDIO.\n[Aside] He hath ta’en the infection: hold it up.\nDON PEDRO.\nHath she made her affection known to Benedick?\n\nLEONATO.\nNo; and swears she never will: that’s her torment.\n\nCLAUDIO.\n’Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: ‘Shall I,’ says she, ‘that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him?’\n\nLEONATO.\nThis says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for she’ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNow you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.\n\nLEONATO.\nO! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThat.\n\nLEONATO.\nO! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her: ‘I measure him,’ says she, ‘by my own spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him, I should.’\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThen down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; ‘O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!’\n\nLEONATO.\nShe doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nIt were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nTo what end? he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAnd he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd she is exceeding wise.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nIn everything but in loving Benedick.\n\nLEONATO.\nO! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what he will say.\n\nLEONATO.\nWere it good, think you?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nHero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nShe doth well: if she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it; for the man,—as you know all,—hath a contemptible spirit.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nHe is a very proper man.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHe hath indeed a good outward happiness.\n\nCLAUDIO.\n’Fore God, and in my mind, very wise.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHe doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd I take him to be valiant.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAs Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.\n\nLEONATO.\nIf he do fear God, a’ must necessarily keep peace: if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAnd so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNever tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.\n\nLEONATO.\nNay, that’s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWell, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.\n\nLEONATO.\nMy lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.\n\nCLAUDIO.\n[Aside] If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation.\n\nDON PEDRO.\n[Aside] Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such matter: that’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.\n\n[Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato.]\n\nBENEDICK.\n[Advancing from the arbour.] This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair: ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: ’tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she’s a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.\n\nEnter Beatrice.\n\nBEATRICE.\nAgainst my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.\n\nBENEDICK.\nFair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.\n\nBEATRICE.\nI took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.\n\nBENEDICK.\nYou take pleasure then in the message?\n\nBEATRICE.\nYea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point, and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBENEDICK.\nHa! ‘Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner,’ there’s a double meaning in that. ‘I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me,’ that’s as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"ACT III\nSCENE I. Leonato’s Garden.\nEnter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.\n\nHERO.\nGood Margaret, run thee to the parlour;\nThere shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice\nProposing with the Prince and Claudio:\nWhisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursala\nWalk in the orchard, and our whole discourse\nIs all of her; say that thou overheard’st us,\nAnd bid her steal into the pleached bower,\nWhere honey-suckles, ripen’d by the sun,\nForbid the sun to enter; like favourites,\nMade proud by princes, that advance their pride\nAgainst that power that bred it. There will she hide her,\nTo listen our propose. This is thy office;\nBear thee well in it and leave us alone.\n\nMARGARET.\nI’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nHERO.\nNow, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,\nAs we do trace this alley up and down,\nOur talk must only be of Benedick:\nWhen I do name him, let it be thy part\nTo praise him more than ever man did merit.\nMy talk to thee must be how Benedick\nIs sick in love with Beatrice: of this matter\nIs little Cupid’s crafty arrow made,\nThat only wounds by hearsay.\n\nEnter Beatrice behind.\n\nNow begin;\nFor look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs\nClose by the ground, to hear our conference.\n\nURSULA.\nThe pleasant’st angling is to see the fish\nCut with her golden oars the silver stream,\nAnd greedily devour the treacherous bait:\nSo angle we for Beatrice; who even now\nIs couched in the woodbine coverture.\nFear you not my part of the dialogue.\n\nHERO.\nThen go we near her, that her ear lose nothing\nOf the false sweet bait that we lay for it.\n\n[They advance to the bower.]\n\nNo, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;\nI know her spirits are as coy and wild\nAs haggards of the rock.\n\nURSULA.\nBut are you sure\nThat Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?\n\nHERO.\nSo says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord.\nURSULA.\nAnd did they bid you tell her of it, madam?\nHERO.\nThey did entreat me to acquaint her of it;\nBut I persuaded them, if they lov’d Benedick,\nTo wish him wrestle with affection,\nAnd never to let Beatrice know of it.\n\nURSULA.\nWhy did you so? Doth not the gentleman\nDeserve as full as fortunate a bed\nAs ever Beatrice shall couch upon?\n\nHERO.\nO god of love! I know he doth deserve\nAs much as may be yielded to a man;\nBut Nature never fram’d a woman’s heart\nOf prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;\nDisdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,\nMisprising what they look on, and her wit\nValues itself so highly, that to her\nAll matter else seems weak. She cannot love,\nNor take no shape nor project of affection,\nShe is so self-endear’d.\n\nURSULA.\nSure I think so;\nAnd therefore certainly it were not good\nShe knew his love, lest she make sport at it.\n\nHERO.\nWhy, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,\nHow wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d,\nBut she would spell him backward: if fair-fac’d,\nShe would swear the gentleman should be her sister;\nIf black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick,\nMade a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;\nIf low, an agate very vilely cut;\nIf speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;\nIf silent, why, a block moved with none.\nSo turns she every man the wrong side out,\nAnd never gives to truth and virtue that\nWhich simpleness and merit purchaseth.\n\nURSULA.\nSure, sure, such carping is not commendable.\n\nHERO.\nNo; not to be so odd, and from all fashions,\nAs Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.\nBut who dare tell her so? If I should speak,\nShe would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me\nOut of myself, press me to death with wit.\nTherefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,\nConsume away in sighs, waste inwardly:\nIt were a better death than die with mocks,\nWhich is as bad as die with tickling.\n\nURSULA.\nYet tell her of it: hear what she will say.\n\nHERO.\nNo; rather I will go to Benedick,\nAnd counsel him to fight against his passion.\nAnd, truly, I’ll devise some honest slanders\nTo stain my cousin with. One doth not know\nHow much an ill word may empoison liking.\n\nURSULA.\nO! do not do your cousin such a wrong.\nShe cannot be so much without true judgment,—\nHaving so swift and excellent a wit\nAs she is priz’d to have,—as to refuse\nSo rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.\n\nHERO.\nHe is the only man of Italy,\nAlways excepted my dear Claudio.\n\nURSULA.\nI pray you, be not angry with me, madam,\nSpeaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,\nFor shape, for bearing, argument and valour,\nGoes foremost in report through Italy.\n\nHERO.\nIndeed, he hath an excellent good name.\n\nURSULA.\nHis excellence did earn it, ere he had it.\nWhen are you married, madam?\n\nHERO.\nWhy, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in:\nI’ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel\nWhich is the best to furnish me tomorrow.\n\nURSULA.\nShe’s lim’d, I warrant you,\nWe have caught her, madam.\n\nHERO.\nIf it prove so, then loving goes by haps:\nSome Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.\n\n[Exeunt Hero and Ursula.]\n\nBEATRICE.\n[Advancing.] What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?\nStand I condemn’d for pride and scorn so much?\nContempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!\nNo glory lives behind the back of such.\nAnd, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,\nTaming my wild heart to thy loving hand:\nIf thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee\nTo bind our loves up in a holy band;\nFor others say thou dost deserve, and I\nBelieve it better than reportingly.\n\n[Exit.]",

A Room in Leonato’s House.\nEnter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick and Leonato.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe me.\nDON PEDRO.\nNay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage, as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth; he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.\n\nBENEDICK.\nGallants, I am not as I have been.\n\nLEONATO.\nSo say I: methinks you are sadder.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI hope he be in love.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHang him, truant! there’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI have the tooth-ache.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nDraw it.\n\nBENEDICK.\nHang it.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYou must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhat! sigh for the tooth-ache?\n\nLEONATO.\nWhere is but a humour or a worm?\n\nBENEDICK.\nWell, everyone can master a grief but he that has it.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYet say I, he is in love.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThere is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs: a’ brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHath any man seen him at the barber’s?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNo, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him; and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.\n\nLEONATO.\nIndeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nNay, a’ rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nThat’s as much as to say the sweet youth’s in love.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThe greatest note of it is his melancholy.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd when was he wont to wash his face?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a lute-string, and now governed by stops.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nIndeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is in love.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNay, but I know who loves him.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nThat would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nShe shall be buried with her face upwards.\n\nBENEDICK.\nYet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby-horses must not hear.\n\n[Exeunt Benedick and Leonato.]\n\nDON PEDRO.\nFor my life, to break with him about Beatrice.\n\nCLAUDIO.\n’Tis even so.

For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage; surely suit ill-spent and labour ill bestowed!\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhy, what’s the matter?\n\nDON JOHN.\nI came hither to tell you; and circumstances shortened,—for she has been too long a talking of,—the lady is disloyal.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWho, Hero?\n\nDON JOHN.\nEven she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nDisloyal?\n\nDON JOHN.\nThe word’s too good to paint out her wickedness; I could say, she were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding-day: if you love her then, tomorrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour to change your mind.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nMay this be so?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI will not think it.\n\nDON JOHN.\nIf you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know. If you will follow me, I will show you enough; and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow, in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAnd, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her.\n\nDON JOHN.\nI will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nO day untowardly turned!\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO mischief strangely thwarting!\n\nDON JOHN.\nO plague right well prevented!

    "content":"Scene III. A Street.\nEnter Dogberry and Verges, with the Watch.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nAre you good men and true?\n\nVERGES.\nYea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nNay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.\n\nVERGES.\nWell, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nFirst, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nHugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write and read.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nCome hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and read comes by Nature.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nBoth which, Master Constable,—\n\nDOGBERRY.\nYou have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nHow, if a’ will not stand?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nWhy, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.\n\nVERGES.\nIf he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nTrue, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nWe will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nWhy, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nHow if they will not?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nWhy then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nWell, sir.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nIf you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nIf we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nTruly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company.\n\nVERGES.\nYou have been always called a merciful man, partner.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nTruly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.\n\nVERGES.\nIf you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nHow if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nWhy then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never answer a calf when he bleats.\n\nVERGES.\n’Tis very true.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nThis is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the Prince’s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.\n\nVERGES.\nNay, by’r lady, that I think, a’ cannot.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nFive shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against his will.\n\nVERGES.\nBy’r lady, I think it be so.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nHa, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbour.\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nWell, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nOne word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about Signior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech you.\n\n[Exeunt Dogberry and Verges.]\n\nEnter Borachio and Conrade.\n\nBORACHIO.\nWhat, Conrade!\n\nWATCH.\n[Aside] Peace! stir not.\n\nBORACHIO.\nConrade, I say!\n\nCONRADE.\nHere, man. I am at thy elbow.\n\nBORACHIO.\nMass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a scab follow.\n\nCONRADE.\nI will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy tale.\n\nBORACHIO.\nStand thee close then under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.\n\nWATCH.\n[Aside] Some treason, masters; yet stand close.\n\nBORACHIO.\nTherefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.\n\nCONRADE.\nIs it possible that any villainy should be so dear?\n\nBORACHIO.\nThou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.\n\nCONRADE.\nI wonder at it.\n\nBORACHIO.\nThat shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.\n\nCONRADE.\nYes, it is apparel.\n\nBORACHIO.\nI mean, the fashion.\n\nCONRADE.\nYes, the fashion is the fashion.\n\nBORACHIO.\nTush! I may as well say the fool’s the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?\n\nWATCH.\n[Aside] I know that Deformed; a’ has been a vile thief this seven years; a’ goes up and down like a gentleman: I remember his name.\n\nBORACHIO.\nDidst thou not hear somebody?\n\nCONRADE.\nNo: ’twas the vane on the house.\n\nBORACHIO.\nSeest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is? how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty? sometime fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers in the reechy painting; sometime like god Bel’s priests in the old church window; sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?\n\nCONRADE.\nAll this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?\n\nBORACHIO.\nNot so neither; but know, that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand times good night,—I tell this tale vilely:—I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.\n\nCONRADE.\nAnd thought they Margaret was Hero?\n\nBORACHIO.\nTwo of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my master, knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o’er night, and send her home again without a husband.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nWe charge you in the Prince’s name, stand!\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nCall up the right Master Constable. We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nAnd one Deformed is one of them: I know him, a’ wears a lock.\n\nCONRADE.\nMasters, masters!\n\nSECOND WATCH.\nYou’ll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.\n\nCONRADE.\nMasters,—\n\nFIRST WATCH.\nNever speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.\n\nBORACHIO. We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of these men’s bills.\n\nCONRADE.\nA commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we’ll obey you.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Another Room in Leonato’s House.\nEnter Leonato and Dogberry and Verges.\n\nLEONATO.\nWhat would you with me, honest neighbour?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nMarry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns you nearly.\n\nLEONATO.\nBrief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nMarry, this it is, sir.\n\nVERGES.\nYes, in truth it is, sir.\n\nLEONATO.\nWhat is it, my good friends?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nGoodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.\n\nVERGES.\nYes, I thank God, I am as honest as any man living, that is an old man and no honester than I.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nComparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.\n\nLEONATO.\nNeighbours, you are tedious.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nIt pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.\n\nLEONATO.\nAll thy tediousness on me! ah?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nYea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis; for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.\n\nVERGES.\nAnd so am I.\n\nLEONATO.\nI would fain know what you have to say.\n\nVERGES.\nMarry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your worship’s presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nA good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, ‘when the age is in, the wit is out.’ God help us! it is a world to see! Well said, i’ faith, neighbour Verges: well, God’s a good man; and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’ faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.\n\nLEONATO.\nIndeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nGifts that God gives.\n\nLEONATO.\nI must leave you.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nOne word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before your worship.\n\nLEONATO.\nTake their examination yourself, and bring it me: I am now in great haste, as may appear unto you.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nIt shall be suffigance.\n\nLEONATO.\nDrink some wine ere you go: fare you well.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMy lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.\n\nLEONATO.\nI’ll wait upon them: I am ready.\n\n[Exeunt Leonato and Messenger.]\n\nDOGBERRY.\nGo, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.\n\nVERGES.\nAnd we must do it wisely.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nWe will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here’s that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT IV\nSCENE I. The Inside of a Church.\nEnter Don Pedro, Don John, Leonato, Friar Francis, Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice &c.\n\nLEONATO.\nCome, Friar Francis, be brief: only to the plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.\n\nFRIAR.\nYou come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNo.\n\nLEONATO.\nTo be married to her, friar; you come to marry her.\n\nFRIAR.\nLady, you come hither to be married to this Count?\n\nHERO.\nI do.\n\nFRIAR.\nIf either of you know any inward impediment, why you should not be conjoined, I charge you, on your souls, to utter it.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nKnow you any, Hero?\n\nHERO.\nNone, my lord.\n\nFRIAR.\nKnow you any, Count?\n\nLEONATO.\nI dare make his answer; none.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO! what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not knowing what they do!\n\nBENEDICK.\nHow now! Interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as ah! ha! he!\n\nCLAUDIO.\nStand thee by, Friar. Father, by your leave:\nWill you with free and unconstrained soul\nGive me this maid, your daughter?\n\nLEONATO.\nAs freely, son, as God did give her me.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAnd what have I to give you back whose worth\nMay counterpoise this rich and precious gift?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nNothing, unless you render her again.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nSweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.\nThere, Leonato, take her back again:\nGive not this rotten orange to your friend;\nShe’s but the sign and semblance of her honour.\nBehold! how like a maid she blushes here.\nO! what authority and show of truth\nCan cunning sin cover itself withal.\nComes not that blood as modest evidence\nTo witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,\nAll you that see her, that she were a maid,\nBy these exterior shows? But she is none:\nShe knows the heat of a luxurious bed;\nHer blush is guiltiness, not modesty.\n\nLEONATO.\nWhat do you mean, my lord?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNot to be married,\nNot to knit my soul to an approved wanton.\n\nLEONATO.\nDear my lord, if you, in your own proof,\nHave vanquish’d the resistance of her youth,\nAnd made defeat of her virginity,—\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI know what you would say: if I have known her,\nYou will say she did embrace me as a husband,\nAnd so extenuate the forehand sin: No, Leonato,\nI never tempted her with word too large;\nBut as a brother to his sister show’d\nBashful sincerity and comely love.\n\nHERO.\nAnd seem’d I ever otherwise to you?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nOut on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:\nYou seem to me as Dian in her orb,\nAs chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;\nBut you are more intemperate in your blood\nThan Venus, or those pamper’d animals\nThat rage in savage sensuality.\n\nHERO.\nIs my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?\n\nLEONATO.\nSweet Prince, why speak not you?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhat should I speak?\nI stand dishonour’d, that have gone about\nTo link my dear friend to a common stale.\n\nLEONATO.\nAre these things spoken, or do I but dream?\n\nDON JOHN.\nSir, they are spoken, and these things are true.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThis looks not like a nuptial.\n\nHERO.\nTrue! O God!\n\nCLAUDIO.\nLeonato, stand I here?\nIs this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother?\nIs this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own?\n\nLEONATO.\nAll this is so; but what of this, my lord?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nLet me but move one question to your daughter,\nAnd by that fatherly and kindly power\nThat you have in her, bid her answer truly.\n\nLEONATO.\nI charge thee do so, as thou art my child.\n\nHERO.\nO, God defend me! how am I beset!\nWhat kind of catechizing call you this?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nTo make you answer truly to your name.\n\nHERO.\nIs it not Hero? Who can blot that name\nWith any just reproach?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nMarry, that can Hero:\nHero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.\nWhat man was he talk’d with you yesternight\nOut at your window, betwixt twelve and one?\nNow, if you are a maid, answer to this.\n\nHERO.\nI talk’d with no man at that hour, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhy, then are you no maiden.\nLeonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon my honour,\nMyself, my brother, and this grieved Count,\nDid see her, hear her, at that hour last night,\nTalk with a ruffian at her chamber window;\nWho hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,\nConfess’d the vile encounters they have had\nA thousand times in secret.\n\nDON JOHN.\nFie, fie! they are not to be nam’d, my lord,\nNot to be spoke of;\nThere is not chastity enough in language\nWithout offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,\nI am sorry for thy much misgovernment.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been,\nIf half thy outward graces had been plac’d\nAbout thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!\nBut fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,\nThou pure impiety, and impious purity!\nFor thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love,\nAnd on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,\nTo turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,\nAnd never shall it more be gracious.\n\nLEONATO.\nHath no man’s dagger here a point for me?\n\n[Hero swoons.]\n\nBEATRICE.\nWhy, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?\n\nDON JOHN.\nCome, let us go. These things, come thus to light,\nSmother her spirits up.\n\n[Exeunt Don Pedro, Don John and Claudio.]\n\nBENEDICK.\nHow doth the lady?\n\nBEATRICE.\nDead, I think! Help, uncle! Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!\n\nLEONATO.\nO Fate! take not away thy heavy hand:\nDeath is the fairest cover for her shame\nThat may be wish’d for.\n\nBEATRICE.\nHow now, cousin Hero?\n\nFRIAR.\nHave comfort, lady.\n\nLEONATO.\nDost thou look up?\n\nFRIAR.\nYea; wherefore should she not?\n\nLEONATO.\nWherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing\nCry shame upon her? Could she here deny\nThe story that is printed in her blood?\nDo not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes;\nFor, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,\nThought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,\nMyself would, on the rearward of reproaches,\nStrike at thy life. Griev’d I, I had but one?\nChid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?\nO! one too much by thee. Why had I one?\nWhy ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?\nWhy had I not with charitable hand\nTook up a beggar’s issue at my gates,\nWho smirched thus, and mir’d with infamy,\nI might have said, ‘No part of it is mine;\nThis shame derives itself from unknown loins?’\nBut mine, and mine I lov’d, and mine I prais’d,\nAnd mine that I was proud on, mine so much\nThat I myself was to myself not mine,\nValuing of her; why, she—O! she is fallen\nInto a pit of ink, that the wide sea\nHath drops too few to wash her clean again,\nAnd salt too little which may season give\nTo her foul tainted flesh.\n\nBENEDICK.\nSir, sir, be patient.\nFor my part, I am so attir’d in wonder,\nI know not what to say.\n\nBEATRICE.\nO! on my soul, my cousin is belied!\n\nBENEDICK.\nLady, were you her bedfellow last night?\n\nBEATRICE.\nNo, truly, not; although, until last night,\nI have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.\n\nLEONATO.\nConfirm’d, confirm’d! O! that is stronger made,\nWhich was before barr’d up with ribs of iron.\nWould the two princes lie? and Claudio lie,\nWho lov’d her so, that, speaking of her foulness,\nWash’d it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.\n\nFRIAR.\nHear me a little;\nFor I have only been silent so long,\nAnd given way unto this course of fortune,\nBy noting of the lady: I have mark’d\nA thousand blushing apparitions\nTo start into her face; a thousand innocent shames\nIn angel whiteness bear away those blushes;\nAnd in her eye there hath appear’d a fire,\nTo burn the errors that these princes hold\nAgainst her maiden truth. Call me a fool;\nTrust not my reading nor my observations,\nWhich with experimental seal doth warrant\nThe tenure of my book; trust not my age,\nMy reverence, calling, nor divinity,\nIf this sweet lady lie not guiltless here\nUnder some biting error.\n\nLEONATO.\nFriar, it cannot be.\nThou seest that all the grace that she hath left\nIs that she will not add to her damnation\nA sin of perjury: she not denies it.\nWhy seek’st thou then to cover with excuse\nThat which appears in proper nakedness?\n\nFRIAR.\nLady, what man is he you are accus’d of?\n\nHERO.\nThey know that do accuse me, I know none;\nIf I know more of any man alive\nThan that which maiden modesty doth warrant,\nLet all my sins lack mercy! O, my father!\nProve you that any man with me convers’d\nAt hours unmeet, or that I yesternight\nMaintain’d the change of words with any creature,\nRefuse me, hate me, torture me to death.\n\nFRIAR.\nThere is some strange misprision in the princes.\n\nBENEDICK.\nTwo of them have the very bent of honour;\nAnd if their wisdoms be misled in this,\nThe practice of it lives in John the bastard,\nWhose spirits toil in frame of villainies.\n\nLEONATO.\nI know not. If they speak but truth of her,\nThese hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,\nThe proudest of them shall well hear of it.\nTime hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,\nNor age so eat up my invention,\nNor fortune made such havoc of my means,\nNor my bad life reft me so much of friends,\nBut they shall find, awak’d in such a kind,\nBoth strength of limb and policy of mind,\nAbility in means and choice of friends,\nTo quit me of them throughly.\n\nFRIAR.\nPause awhile,\nAnd let my counsel sway you in this case.\nYour daughter here the princes left for dead;\nLet her awhile be secretly kept in,\nAnd publish it that she is dead indeed:\nMaintain a mourning ostentation;\nAnd on your family’s old monument\nHang mournful epitaphs and do all rites\nThat appertain unto a burial.\n\nLEONATO.\nWhat shall become of this? What will this do?\n\nFRIAR.\nMarry, this well carried shall on her behalf\nChange slander to remorse; that is some good.\nBut not for that dream I on this strange course,\nBut on this travail look for greater birth.\nShe dying, as it must be so maintain’d,\nUpon the instant that she was accus’d,\nShall be lamented, pitied and excus’d\nOf every hearer; for it so falls out\nThat what we have we prize not to the worth\nWhiles we enjoy it, but being lack’d and lost,\nWhy, then we rack the value, then we find\nThe virtue that possession would not show us\nWhiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:\nWhen he shall hear she died upon his words,\nThe idea of her life shall sweetly creep\nInto his study of imagination,\nAnd every lovely organ of her life\nShall come apparell’d in more precious habit,\nMore moving, delicate, and full of life\nInto the eye and prospect of his soul,\nThan when she liv’d indeed: then shall he mourn,—\nIf ever love had interest in his liver,—\nAnd wish he had not so accused her,\nNo, though he thought his accusation true.\nLet this be so, and doubt not but success\nWill fashion the event in better shape\nThan I can lay it down in likelihood.\nBut if all aim but this be levell’d false,\nThe supposition of the lady’s death\nWill quench the wonder of her infamy:\nAnd if it sort not well, you may conceal her,—\nAs best befits her wounded reputation,—\nIn some reclusive and religious life,\nOut of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.\n\nBENEDICK.\nSignior Leonato, let the friar advise you:\nAnd though you know my inwardness and love\nIs very much unto the Prince and Claudio,\nYet, by mine honour, I will deal in this\nAs secretly and justly as your soul\nShould with your body.\n\nLEONATO.\nBeing that I flow in grief,\nThe smallest twine may lead me.\n\nFRIAR.\n’Tis well consented: presently away;\nFor to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.\nCome, lady, die to live: this wedding day\nPerhaps is but prolong’d: have patience and endure.\n[Exeunt Friar, Hero and Leonato.]\n\nBENEDICK.\nLady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?\n\nBEATRICE.\nYea, and I will weep a while longer.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI will not desire that.\n\nBEATRICE.\nYou have no reason; I do it freely.\n\nBENEDICK.\nSurely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.\n\nBEATRICE.\nAh! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIs there any way to show such friendship?\n\nBEATRICE.\nA very even way, but no such friend.\n\nBENEDICK.\nMay a man do it?\n\nBEATRICE.\nIt is a man’s office, but not yours.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange?\n\nBEATRICE.\nAs strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you; but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.\n\nBENEDICK.\nBy my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.\n\nBEATRICE.\nDo not swear by it, and eat it.\n\nBENEDICK.\nI will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it that says I love not you.\n\nBEATRICE.\nWill you not eat your word?\n\nBENEDICK.\nWith no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee.\n\nBEATRICE.\nWhy then, God forgive me!\n\nBENEDICK.\nWhat offence, sweet Beatrice?\n\nBEATRICE.\nYou have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you.\n\nBENEDICK.\nAnd do it with all thy heart.\n\nBEATRICE.\nI love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.\n\nBENEDICK.\nCome, bid me do anything for thee.\n\nBEATRICE.\nKill Claudio.\n\nBENEDICK.\nHa! not for the wide world.\n\nBEATRICE.\nYou kill me to deny it. Farewell.\n\nBENEDICK.\nTarry, sweet Beatrice.\n\nBEATRICE.\nI am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you: nay, I pray you, let me go.\n\nBENEDICK.\nBeatrice,—\n\nBEATRICE.\nIn faith, I will go.\n\nBENEDICK.\nWe’ll be friends first.\n\nBEATRICE.\nYou dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIs Claudio thine enemy?\n\nBEATRICE.\nIs he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O! that I were a man. What! bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,—O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place.\n\nBENEDICK.\nHear me, Beatrice,—\n\nBEATRICE.\nTalk with a man out at a window! a proper saying!\n\nBENEDICK.\nNay, but Beatrice,—\n\nBEATRICE.\nSweet Hero! she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.\n\nBENEDICK.\nBeat—\n\nBEATRICE.\nPrinces and Counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly Count Comfect; a sweet gallant, surely! O! that I were a man for his sake, or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.\n\nBENEDICK.\nTarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.\n\nBEATRICE.\nUse it for my love some other way than swearing by it.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThink you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?\n\nBEATRICE.\nYea, as sure is I have a thought or a soul.\n\nBENEDICK.\nEnough! I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin: I must say she is dead; and so, farewell.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Know, Claudio, to thy head,\nThou hast so wrong’d mine innocent child and me\nThat I am forc’d to lay my reverence by,\nAnd, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,\nDo challenge thee to trial of a man.\nI say thou hast belied mine innocent child:\nThy slander hath gone through and through her heart,\nAnd she lies buried with her ancestors;\nO! in a tomb where never scandal slept,\nSave this of hers, fram’d by thy villainy!\n\nCLAUDIO.\nMy villainy?\n\nLEONATO.\nThine, Claudio; thine, I say.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYou say not right, old man.\n\nLEONATO.\nMy lord, my lord,\nI’ll prove it on his body, if he dare,\nDespite his nice fence and his active practice,\nHis May of youth and bloom of lustihood.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAway! I will not have to do with you.\n\nLEONATO.\nCanst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill’d my child;\nIf thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.\n\nANTONIO.\nHe shall kill two of us, and men indeed:\nBut that’s no matter; let him kill one first:\nWin me and wear me; let him answer me.\nCome, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me.\nSir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence;\nNay, as I am a gentleman, I will.\n\nLEONATO.\nBrother,—\n\nANTONIO.\nContent yourself. God knows I lov’d my niece;\nAnd she is dead, slander’d to death by villains,\nThat dare as well answer a man indeed\nAs I dare take a serpent by the tongue.\nBoys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!\n\nLEONATO.\nBrother Anthony,—\n\nANTONIO.\nHold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,\nAnd what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,\nScambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,\nThat lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,\nGo antickly, show outward hideousness,\nAnd speak off half a dozen dangerous words,\nHow they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;\nAnd this is all!\n\nLEONATO.\nBut, brother Anthony,—\n\nANTONIO.\nCome, ’tis no matter:\nDo not you meddle, let me deal in this.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nGentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.\nMy heart is sorry for your daughter’s death;\nBut, on my honour, she was charg’d with nothing\nBut what was true and very full of proof.\n\nLEONATO.\nMy lord, my lord—\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI will not hear you.\n\nLEONATO.\nNo? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.—\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd shall, or some of us will smart for it.\n\n[Exeunt Leonato and Antonio.]\n\nEnter Benedick.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nSee, see; here comes the man we went to seek.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNow, signior, what news?\n\nBENEDICK.\nGood day, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWelcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWe had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nLeonato and his brother. What think’st thou? Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIn a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWe have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?\n\nBENEDICK.\nIt is in my scabbard; shall I draw it?\n\nDON PEDRO.\nDost thou wear thy wit by thy side?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNever any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAs I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWhat, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.\n\nBENEDICK.\nSir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nNay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBy this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIf he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.\n\nBENEDICK.\nShall I speak a word in your ear?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nGod bless me from a challenge!\n\nBENEDICK.\n[Aside to Claudio.] You are a villain, I jest not: I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nWell I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhat, a feast, a feast?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI’ faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf’s-head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife’s naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?\n\nBENEDICK.\nSir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nI’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. ‘True,’ says she, ‘a fine little one.’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘a great wit.’ ‘Right,’ said she, ‘a great gross one.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘a good wit.’ ‘Just,’ said she, ‘it hurts nobody.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘the gentleman is wise.’ ‘Certain,’ said she, ‘a wise gentleman.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘he hath the tongues.’ ‘That I believe’ said she, ‘for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning: there’s a double tongue; there’s two tongues.’ Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy particular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the properest man in Italy.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nFor the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nYea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man’s daughter told us all.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nAll, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBut when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible Benedick’s head?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nYea, and text underneath, ‘Here dwells Benedick the married man!’\n\nBENEDICK.\nFare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour; you break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be with him.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHe is in earnest.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nIn most profound earnest; and, I’ll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nAnd hath challenged thee?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nMost sincerely.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWhat a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!\n\nCLAUDIO.\nHe is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBut, soft you; let me be: pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did he not say my brother was fled?\n\nEnter Dogberry, Verges, and the Watch, with Conrade and Borachio.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nCome you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHow now! two of my brother’s men bound! Borachio, one!\n\nCLAUDIO.\nHearken after their offence, my lord.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nOfficers, what offence have these men done?\n\nDOGBERRY.\nMarry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nFirst, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nRightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth, there’s one meaning well suited.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWho have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What’s your offence?\n\nBORACHIO.\nSweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer: do you hear me, and let this Count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero’s garments; how you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation; and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nRuns not this speech like iron through your blood?\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI have drunk poison whiles he utter’d it.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBut did my brother set thee on to this?\n\nBORACHIO.\nYea; and paid me richly for the practice of it.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nHe is compos’d and fram’d of treachery: And fled he is upon this villainy.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nSweet Hero! now thy image doth appear\nIn the rare semblance that I lov’d it first.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nCome, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.\n\nVERGES.\nHere, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too.\n\nRe-enter Leonato, Antonio and the Sexton.\n\nLEONATO.\nWhich is the villain? Let me see his eyes,\nThat, when I note another man like him,\nI may avoid him. Which of these is he?\n\nBORACHIO.\nIf you would know your wronger, look on me.\n\nLEONATO.\nArt thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill’d\nMine innocent child?\n\nBORACHIO.\nYea, even I alone.\n\nLEONATO.\nNo, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:\nHere stand a pair of honourable men;\nA third is fled, that had a hand in it.\nI thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death:\nRecord it with your high and worthy deeds.\n’Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI know not how to pray your patience;\nYet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;\nImpose me to what penance your invention\nCan lay upon my sin: yet sinn’d I not\nBut in mistaking.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nBy my soul, nor I:\nAnd yet, to satisfy this good old man,\nI would bend under any heavy weight\nThat he’ll enjoin me to.\n\nLEONATO.\nI cannot bid you bid my daughter live;\nThat were impossible; but, I pray you both,\nPossess the people in Messina here\nHow innocent she died; and if your love\nCan labour aught in sad invention,\nHang her an epitaph upon her tomb,\nAnd sing it to her bones: sing it tonight.\nTomorrow morning come you to my house,\nAnd since you could not be my son-in-law,\nBe yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,\nAlmost the copy of my child that’s dead,\nAnd she alone is heir to both of us:\nGive her the right you should have given her cousin,\nAnd so dies my revenge.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nO noble sir,\nYour over-kindness doth wring tears from me!\nI do embrace your offer; and dispose\nFor henceforth of poor Claudio.\n\nLEONATO.\nTomorrow then I will expect your coming;\nTonight I take my leave. This naughty man\nShall face to face be brought to Margaret,\nWho, I believe, was pack’d in all this wrong,\nHir’d to it by your brother.\n\nBORACHIO.\nNo, by my soul she was not;\nNor knew not what she did when she spoke to me;\nBut always hath been just and virtuous\nIn anything that I do know by her.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nMoreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,— this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.\n\nLEONATO.\nI thank thee for thy care and honest pains.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nYour worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.\n\nLEONATO.\nThere’s for thy pains.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nGod save the foundation!\n\nLEONATO.\nGo, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.\n\nDOGBERRY.\nI leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.\n\n[Exeunt Dogberry and Verges.]\n\nLEONATO.\nUntil tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.\n\nANTONIO.\nFarewell, my lords: we look for you tomorrow.\n\nDON PEDRO.\nWe will not fail.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nTonight I’ll mourn with Hero.\n\n[Exeunt Don Pedro and Claudio.]\n\nLEONATO.\n[To the Watch.] Bring you these fellows on. We’ll talk with Margaret,\nHow her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Leonato’s Garden.\nEnter Benedick and Margaret, meeting.\n\nBENEDICK.\nPray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.\n\nMARGARET.\nWill you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?\n\nBENEDICK.\nIn so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.\n\nMARGARET.\nTo have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs?\n\nBENEDICK.\nThy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth; it catches.\n\nMARGARET.\nAnd yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils, which hit, but hurt not.\n\nBENEDICK.\nA most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.\n\nMARGARET.\nGive us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.\n\nBENEDICK.\nIf you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.\n\nMARGARET.\nWell, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.\n\nBENEDICK.\nAnd therefore will come.\n\n[Exit Margaret.]\n\n    The god of love,\n    That sits above,\n And knows me, and knows me,\n   How pitiful I deserve,—\n\nI mean, in singing: but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no rime to ‘lady’ but ‘baby’, an innocent rime; for ‘scorn,’ ‘horn’, a hard rime; for ‘school’, ‘fool’, a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not born under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.\n\nEnter Beatrice.\n\nSweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?\n\nBEATRICE.\nYea, signior; and depart when you bid me.\n\nBENEDICK.\nO, stay but till then!\n\nBEATRICE.\n‘Then’ is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.\n\nBENEDICK.\nOnly foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.\n\nBEATRICE.\nFoul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?\n\nBEATRICE.\nFor them all together; which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?\n\nBENEDICK.\n‘Suffer love,’ a good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.\n\nBEATRICE.\nIn spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.\n\nBEATRICE.\nIt appears not in this confession: there’s not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself.\n\nBENEDICK.\nAn old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.\n\nBEATRICE.\nAnd how long is that think you?\n\nBENEDICK.\nQuestion: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the wise,—if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,—to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin?\n\nBEATRICE.\nVery ill.\n\nBENEDICK.\nAnd how do you?\n\nBEATRICE.\nVery ill too.\n\nBENEDICK.\nServe God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste.\n\nEnter Ursula.\n\nURSULA.\nMadam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder’s old coil at home: it is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?\n\nBEATRICE.\nWill you go hear this news, signior?\n\nBENEDICK.\nI will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle’s.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but, in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.\n\nCLAUDIO.\nI had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.\n\nBENEDICK.\nCome, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels.\n\nLEONATO.\nWe’ll have dancing afterward.\n\nBENEDICK.\nFirst, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverent than one tipped with horn.\n\nEnter Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nMy lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,\nAnd brought with armed men back to Messina.\n\nBENEDICK.\nThink not on him till tomorrow: I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers!\n\n[Dance. Exeunt.]",
