Ah, timorous wretch!\nThou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;\nAnd given unto the house of York such head\nAs thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.\nTo entail him and his heirs unto the crown,\nWhat is it, but to make thy sepulchre\nAnd creep into it far before thy time?\nWarwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;\nStern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;\nThe duke is made protector of the realm;\nAnd yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds\nThe trembling lamb environed with wolves.\nHad I been there, which am a silly woman,\nThe soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes\nBefore I would have granted to that act.\nBut thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:\nAnd seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself\nBoth from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,\nUntil that act of parliament be repeal'd\nWhereby my son is disinherited.\nThe northern lords that have forsworn thy colours\nWill follow mine, if once they see them spread;\nAnd spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace\nAnd utter ruin of the house of York.\nThus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;\nOur army is ready; come, we'll after them.\nKING HENRY VI\nStay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nThou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.\nKING HENRY VI\nGentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAy, to be murder'd by his enemies.\nPRINCE EDWARD\nWhen I return with victory from the field\nI'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nCome, son, away; we may not linger thus.\nExeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD\n\nKING HENRY VI\nPoor queen! how love to me and to her son\nHath made her break out into terms of rage!\nRevenged may she be on that hateful duke,\nWhose haughty spirit, winged with desire,\nWill cost my crown, and like an empty eagle\nTire on the flesh of me and of my son!\nThe loss of those three lords torments my heart:\nI'll write unto them and entreat them fair.\nCome, cousin you shall be the messenger.\nEXETER\nAnd I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.\nExeunt",

KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again\nKING LEWIS XI\nFair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,\nSit down with us: it ill befits thy state\nAnd birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nNo, mighty King of France: now Margaret\nMust strike her sail and learn awhile to serve\nWhere kings command. I was, I must confess,\nGreat Albion's queen in former golden days:\nBut now mischance hath trod my title down,\nAnd with dishonour laid me on the ground;\nWhere I must take like seat unto my fortune,\nAnd to my humble seat conform myself.\nKING LEWIS XI\nWhy, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?\nQUEEN MARGARET\nFrom such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears\nAnd stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.\nKING LEWIS XI\nWhate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,\nAnd sit thee by our side:\nSeats her by him\n\nYield not thy neck\nTo fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind\nStill ride in triumph over all mischance.\nBe plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;\nIt shall be eased, if France can yield relief.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nThose gracious words revive my drooping thoughts\nAnd give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.\nNow, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,\nThat Henry, sole possessor of my love,\nIs of a king become a banish'd man,\nAnd forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;\nWhile proud ambitious Edward Duke of York\nUsurps the regal title and the seat\nOf England's true-anointed lawful king.\nThis is the cause that I, poor Margaret,\nWith this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,\nAm come to crave thy just and lawful aid;\nAnd if thou fail us, all our hope is done:\nScotland hath will to help, but cannot help;\nOur people and our peers are both misled,\nOur treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,\nAnd, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.\nKING LEWIS XI\nRenowned queen, with patience calm the storm,\nWhile we bethink a means to break it off.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nThe more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.\nKING LEWIS XI\nThe more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nO, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.\nAnd see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!\nEnter WARWICK\n\nKING LEWIS XI\nWhat's he approacheth boldly to our presence?\nQUEEN MARGARET\nOur Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.\nKING LEWIS XI\nWelcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?\nHe descends. She ariseth\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAy, now begins a second storm to rise;\nFor this is he that moves both wind and tide.\nWARWICK\nFrom worthy Edward, King of Albion,\nMy lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,\nI come, in kindness and unfeigned love,\nFirst, to do greetings to thy royal person;\nAnd then to crave a league of amity;\nAnd lastly, to confirm that amity\nWith a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant\nThat virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,\nTo England's king in lawful marriage.\nQUEEN MARGARET\n[Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.\nWARWICK\n[To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,\nI am commanded, with your leave and favour,\nHumbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue\nTo tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;\nWhere fame, late entering at his heedful ears,\nHath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nKing Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,\nBefore you answer Warwick. His demand\nSprings not from Edward's well-meant honest love,\nBut from deceit bred by necessity;\nFor how can tyrants safely govern home,\nUnless abroad they purchase great alliance?\nTo prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,\nThat Henry liveth still: but were he dead,\nYet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.\nLook, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage\nThou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;\nFor though usurpers sway the rule awhile,\nYet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.\nWARWICK\nInjurious Margaret!\nPRINCE EDWARD\nAnd why not queen?\nWARWICK\nBecause thy father Henry did usurp;\nAnd thou no more are prince than she is queen.\nOXFORD\nThen Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,\nWhich did subdue the greatest part of Spain;\nAnd, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,\nWhose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;\nAnd, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,\nWho by his prowess conquered all France:\nFrom these our Henry lineally descends.\nWARWICK\nOxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,\nYou told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost\nAll that which Henry Fifth had gotten?\nMethinks these peers of France should smile at that.\nBut for the rest, you tell a pedigree\nOf threescore and two years; a silly time\nTo make prescription for a kingdom's worth.\nOXFORD\nWhy, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,\nWhom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,\nAnd not bewray thy treason with a blush?\nWARWICK\nCan Oxford, that did ever fence the right,\nNow buckler falsehood with a pedigree?\nFor shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.\nOXFORD\nCall him my king by whose injurious doom\nMy elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,\nWas done to death? and more than so, my father,\nEven in the downfall of his mellow'd years,\nWhen nature brought him to the door of death?\nNo, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,\nThis arm upholds the house of Lancaster.\nWARWICK\nAnd I the house of York.\nKING LEWIS XI\nQueen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,\nVouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,\nWhile I use further conference with Warwick.\nThey stand aloof\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nHeavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!\nKING LEWIS XI\nNow Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,\nIs Edward your true king?

Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers\n\nKING EDWARD IV\nBrave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,\nWhich, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,\nMust by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.\nI need not add more fuel to your fire,\nFor well I wot ye blaze to burn them out\nGive signal to the fight, and to it, lords!\nQUEEN MARGARET\nLords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say\nMy tears gainsay; for every word I speak,\nYe see, I drink the water of mine eyes.\nTherefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,\nIs prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,\nHis realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,\nHis statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;\nAnd yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.\nYou fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,\nBe valiant and give signal to the fight.\nAlarum.
