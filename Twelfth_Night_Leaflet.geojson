Enough; no more;\n’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\nO spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,\nThat notwithstanding thy capacity\nReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\nOf what validity and pitch soever,\nBut falls into abatement and low price\nEven in a minute!

    "content":"SCENE III. A Room in Olivia’s House.\nEnter Sir Toby and Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.\n\nMARIA.\nBy my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights; your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, let her except, before excepted.\n\nMARIA.\nAy, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nConfine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.\n\nMARIA.\nThat quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWho? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?\n\nMARIA.\nAy, he.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHe’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.\n\nMARIA.\nWhat’s that to th’ purpose?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, he has three thousand ducats a year.\n\nMARIA.\nAy, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool, and a prodigal.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nFie, that you’ll say so! he plays o’ the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.\n\nMARIA.\nHe hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nBy this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they?\n\nMARIA.\nThey that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWith drinking healths to my niece; I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ the toe like a parish top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo: for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.\n\nEnter Sir Andrew.\n\nAGUECHEEK.\nSir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSweet Sir Andrew!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBless you, fair shrew.\n\nMARIA.\nAnd you too, sir.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAccost, Sir Andrew, accost.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhat’s that?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMy niece’s chamber-maid.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nGood Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.\n\nMARIA.\nMy name is Mary, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nGood Mistress Mary Accost,—\n\nSIR TOBY.\nYou mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBy my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of accost?\n\nMARIA.\nFare you well, gentlemen.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?\n\nMARIA.\nSir, I have not you by the hand.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nMarry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand.\n\nMARIA.\nNow, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th’ buttery bar and let it drink.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?\n\nMARIA.\nIt’s dry, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhy, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?\n\nMARIA.\nA dry jest, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAre you full of them?\n\nMARIA.\nAy, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.\n\n[Exit Maria.]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nO knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put down?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNever in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNo question.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPourquoy, my dear knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhat is pourquoy? Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but followed the arts!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThen hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhy, would that have mended my hair?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPast question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBut it becomes me well enough, does’t not?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nExcellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFaith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nShe’ll none o’ the Count; she’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life in’t, man.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ the strangest mind i’ the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nArt thou good at these kick-shawses, knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAs any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFaith, I can cut a caper.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd I can cut the mutton to’t.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam’d-colour’d stock. Shall we set about some revels?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nTaurus? That’s sides and heart.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNo, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha, ha, excellent!\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A Room in Olivia’s House.\nEnter Maria and Clown.\n\nMARIA.\nNay; either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter, in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.\n\nCLOWN.\nLet her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours.\n\nMARIA.\nMake that good.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe shall see none to fear.\n\nMARIA.\nA good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of I fear no colours.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhere, good Mistress Mary?\n\nMARIA.\nIn the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.\n\nCLOWN.\nWell, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents.\n\nMARIA.\nYet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or to be turned away; is not that as good as a hanging to you?\n\nCLOWN.\nMany a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning away, let summer bear it out.\n\nMARIA.\nYou are resolute then?\n\nCLOWN.\nNot so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.\n\nMARIA.\nThat if one break, the other will hold; or if both break, your gaskins fall.\n\nCLOWN.\nApt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.\n\nMARIA.\nPeace, you rogue, no more o’ that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Olivia with Malvolio.\n\nCLOWN.\nWit, and’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? Better a witty fool than a foolish wit. God bless thee, lady!\n\nOLIVIA.\nTake the fool away.\n\nCLOWN.\nDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGo to, y’are a dry fool; I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest.\n\nCLOWN.\nTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away.\n\nOLIVIA.\nSir, I bade them take away you.\n\nCLOWN.\nMisprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non facit monachum: that’s as much to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.\n\nOLIVIA.\nCan you do it?\n\nCLOWN.\nDexteriously, good madonna.\n\nOLIVIA.\nMake your proof.\n\nCLOWN.\nI must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWell sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll ’bide your proof.\n\nCLOWN.\nGood madonna, why mourn’st thou?\n\nOLIVIA.\nGood fool, for my brother’s death.\n\nCLOWN.\nI think his soul is in hell, madonna.\n\nOLIVIA.\nI know his soul is in heaven, fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nThe more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nYes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nGod send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHow say you to that, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools’ zanies.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.\n\nCLOWN.\nNow Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak’st well of fools!\n\nEnter Maria.\n\nMARIA.\nMadam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nFrom the Count Orsino, is it?\n\nMARIA.\nI know not, madam; ’tis a fair young man, and well attended.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWho of my people hold him in delay?\n\nMARIA.\nSir Toby, madam, your kinsman.\n\nOLIVIA.\nFetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him!\n\n[Exit Maria.]\n\nGo you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick, or not at home. What you will, to dismiss it.\n\n[Exit Malvolio.]\n\nNow you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.\n\nCLOWN.\nThou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool: whose skull Jove cram with brains, for here he comes, one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.\n\nEnter Sir Toby.\n\nOLIVIA.\nBy mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA gentleman.\n\nOLIVIA.\nA gentleman? What gentleman?\n\nSIR TOBY.\n’Tis a gentleman here. A plague o’ these pickle-herrings! How now, sot?\n\nCLOWN.\nGood Sir Toby.\n\nOLIVIA.\nCousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLechery! I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAy, marry, what is he?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLet him be the devil an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I. Well, it’s all one.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat’s a drunken man like, fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nLike a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGo thou and seek the coroner, and let him sit o’ my coz; for he’s in the third degree of drink; he’s drowned. Go, look after him.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the madman.\n\n[Exit Clown.]\n\nEnter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any denial.\n\nOLIVIA.\nTell him, he shall not speak with me.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHas been told so; and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post, and be the supporter of a bench, but he’ll speak with you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat kind o’ man is he?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nWhy, of mankind.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat manner of man?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nOf very ill manner; he’ll speak with you, will you or no.\n\nOLIVIA.\nOf what personage and years is he?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nNot yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling, when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.\n\nOLIVIA.\nLet him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGentlewoman, my lady calls.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Maria.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGive me my veil; come, throw it o’er my face.\nWe’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.\n\nEnter Viola.\n\nVIOLA.\nThe honourable lady of the house, which is she?\n\nOLIVIA.\nSpeak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?\n\nVIOLA.\nMost radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhence came you, sir?\n\nVIOLA.\nI can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAre you a comedian?\n\nVIOLA.\nNo, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?\n\nOLIVIA.\nIf I do not usurp myself, I am.\n\nVIOLA.\nMost certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message.\n\nOLIVIA.\nCome to what is important in’t: I forgive you the praise.\n\nVIOLA.\nAlas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIt is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: ’tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.\n\nMARIA.\nWill you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.\n\nVIOLA.\nNo, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger.\n\nOLIVIA.\nSure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.\n\nVIOLA.\nIt alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage; I hold the olive in my hand: my words are as full of peace as matter.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?\n\nVIOLA.\nThe rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your ears, divinity; to any other’s, profanation.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGive us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.\n\n[Exit Maria.]\n\nNow, sir, what is your text?\n\nVIOLA.\nMost sweet lady—\n\nOLIVIA.\nA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text?\n\nVIOLA.\nIn Orsino’s bosom.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIn his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?\n\nVIOLA.\nTo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?\n\nVIOLA.\nGood madam, let me see your face.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHave you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. [Unveiling.] Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is’t not well done?\n\nVIOLA.\nExcellently done, if God did all.\n\nOLIVIA.\n’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and weather.\n\nVIOLA.\n’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white\nNature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.\nLady, you are the cruel’st she alive\nIf you will lead these graces to the grave,\nAnd leave the world no copy.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?\n\nVIOLA.\nI see you what you are, you are too proud;\nBut, if you were the devil, you are fair.\nMy lord and master loves you. O, such love\nCould be but recompens’d though you were crown’d\nThe nonpareil of beauty!\n\nOLIVIA.\nHow does he love me?\n\nVIOLA.\nWith adorations, fertile tears,\nWith groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYour lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:\nYet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,\nOf great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;\nIn voices well divulg’d, free, learn’d, and valiant,\nAnd in dimension and the shape of nature,\nA gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.\nHe might have took his answer long ago.\n\nVIOLA.\nIf I did love you in my master’s flame,\nWith such a suff’ring, such a deadly life,\nIn your denial I would find no sense,\nI would not understand it.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy, what would you?\n\nVIOLA.\nMake me a willow cabin at your gate,\nAnd call upon my soul within the house;\nWrite loyal cantons of contemned love,\nAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;\nHallow your name to the reverberate hills,\nAnd make the babbling gossip of the air\nCry out Olivia! O, you should not rest\nBetween the elements of air and earth,\nBut you should pity me.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYou might do much.\nWhat is your parentage?\n\nVIOLA.\nAbove my fortunes, yet my state is well:\nI am a gentleman.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGet you to your lord;\nI cannot love him: let him send no more,\nUnless, perchance, you come to me again,\nTo tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:\nI thank you for your pains: spend this for me.\n\nVIOLA.\nI am no fee’d post, lady; keep your purse;\nMy master, not myself, lacks recompense.\nLove make his heart of flint that you shall love,\nAnd let your fervour like my master’s be\nPlac’d in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat is your parentage?\n‘Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:\nI am a gentleman.’ I’ll be sworn thou art;\nThy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,\nDo give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft, soft!\nUnless the master were the man. How now?\nEven so quickly may one catch the plague?\nMethinks I feel this youth’s perfections\nWith an invisible and subtle stealth\nTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.\nWhat ho, Malvolio!\n\nEnter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHere, madam, at your service.\n\nOLIVIA.\nRun after that same peevish messenger\nThe County’s man: he left this ring behind him,\nWould I or not; tell him, I’ll none of it.\nDesire him not to flatter with his lord,\nNor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him.\nIf that the youth will come this way tomorrow,\nI’ll give him reasons for’t. Hie thee, Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMadam, I will.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOLIVIA.\nI do I know not what, and fear to find\nMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.\nFate, show thy force, ourselves we do not owe.\nWhat is decreed must be; and be this so!\n\n[Exit.]",

A Room in Olivia’s House.\nEnter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nApproach, Sir Andrew; not to be abed after midnight, is to be up betimes; and diluculo surgere, thou know’st.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late is to be up late.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA false conclusion; I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight, and to go to bed then is early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four elements?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFaith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTh’art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.\nMarian, I say! a stoup of wine.\n\nEnter Clown.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nHere comes the fool, i’ faith.\n\nCLOWN.\nHow now, my hearts? Did you never see the picture of “we three”?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWelcome, ass. Now let’s have a catch.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBy my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spok’st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus; ’twas very good, i’ faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman. Hadst it?\n\nCLOWN.\nI did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio’s nose is no whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nExcellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome on, there is sixpence for you. Let’s have a song.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThere’s a testril of me too: if one knight give a—\n\nCLOWN.\nWould you have a love-song, or a song of good life?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA love-song, a love-song.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, ay. I care not for good life.\n\nCLOWN. [sings.]\n  O mistress mine, where are you roaming?\n  O stay and hear, your true love’s coming,\n    That can sing both high and low.\n  Trip no further, pretty sweeting.\n  Journeys end in lovers meeting,\n    Every wise man’s son doth know.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nExcellent good, i’ faith.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGood, good.\n\nCLOWN.\n  What is love? ’Tis not hereafter,\n  Present mirth hath present laughter.\n    What’s to come is still unsure.\n  In delay there lies no plenty,\n  Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.\n    Youth’s a stuff will not endure.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nA mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA contagious breath.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nVery sweet and contagious, i’ faith.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd you love me, let’s do’t: I am dog at a catch.\n\nCLOWN.\nBy’r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nMost certain. Let our catch be, “Thou knave.”\n\nCLOWN.\n“Hold thy peace, thou knave” knight? I shall be constrain’d in’t to call thee knave, knight.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n’Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin, fool; it begins “Hold thy peace.”\n\nCLOWN.\nI shall never begin if I hold my peace.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nGood, i’ faith! Come, begin.\n\n[Catch sung.]\n\nEnter Maria.\n\nMARIA.\nWhat a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMy lady’s a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio’s a Peg-a-Ramsey, and [Sings.] Three merry men be we. Am not I consanguineous? Am I not of her blood? Tilly-vally! “Lady”! There dwelt a man in Babylon, Lady, Lady.\n\nCLOWN.\nBeshrew me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too; he does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[Sings.] O’ the twelfth day of December—\n\nMARIA.\nFor the love o’ God, peace!\n\nEnter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMy masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an ale-house of my lady’s house, that ye squeak out your coziers’ catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time, in you?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWe did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you that, though she harbours you as her kinsman she’s nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, and it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[Sings.] Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.\n\nMARIA.\nNay, good Sir Toby.\n\nCLOWN.\n[Sings.] His eyes do show his days are almost done.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nIs’t even so?\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[Sings.] But I will never die.\n\nCLOWN.\n[Sings.] Sir Toby, there you lie.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThis is much credit to you.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[Sings.] Shall I bid him go?\n\nCLOWN.\n[Sings.] What and if you do?\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[Sings.] Shall I bid him go, and spare not?\n\nCLOWN.\n[Sings.] O, no, no, no, no, you dare not.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nOut o’ tune? sir, ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\n\nCLOWN.\nYes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i’ the mouth too.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTh’art i’ the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favour at anything more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule; she shall know of it, by this hand.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nMARIA.\nGo shake your ears.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n’Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nDo’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge; or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.\n\nMARIA.\nSweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the Count’s was today with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPossess us, possess us, tell us something of him.\n\nMARIA.\nMarry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nO, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI have no exquisite reason for’t, but I have reason good enough.\n\nMARIA.\nThe devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser, an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed (as he thinks) with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him. And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat wilt thou do?\n\nMARIA.\nI will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady your niece; on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nExcellent! I smell a device.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI have’t in my nose too.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHe shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she is in love with him.\n\nMARIA.\nMy purpose is indeed a horse of that colour.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd your horse now would make him an ass.\n\nMARIA.\nAss, I doubt not.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nO ’twill be admirable!\n\nMARIA.\nSport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGood night, Penthesilea.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nBefore me, she’s a good wench.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nShe’s a beagle true bred, and one that adores me. What o’ that?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI was adored once too.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLet’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nIf I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSend for money, knight; if thou hast her not i’ th’ end, call me cut.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nIf I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, come, I’ll go burn some sack, ’tis too late to go to bed now. Come, knight, come, knight.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

What years, i’ faith?\n\nVIOLA.\nAbout your years, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nToo old, by heaven! Let still the woman take\nAn elder than herself; so wears she to him,\nSo sways she level in her husband’s heart.\nFor, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\nThan women’s are.\n\nVIOLA.\nI think it well, my lord.\n\nDUKE.\nThen let thy love be younger than thyself,\nOr thy affection cannot hold the bent:\nFor women are as roses, whose fair flower\nBeing once display’d, doth fall that very hour.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd so they are: alas, that they are so;\nTo die, even when they to perfection grow!\n\nEnter Curio and Clown.\n\nDUKE.\nO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\nMark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\nThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun,\nAnd the free maids, that weave their thread with bones\nDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\nAnd dallies with the innocence of love\nLike the old age.\n\nCLOWN.\nAre you ready, sir?\n\nDUKE.\nAy; prithee, sing.\n\n[Music.]\n\nThe Clown’s song.\n\n    Come away, come away, death.\n    And in sad cypress let me be laid.\n    Fly away, fly away, breath;\n    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\n       My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\n         O, prepare it!\n       My part of death no one so true\n         Did share it.\n\n    Not a flower, not a flower sweet,\n    On my black coffin let there be strown:\n    Not a friend, not a friend greet\n    My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown:\n       A thousand thousand sighs to save,\n         Lay me, O, where\n       Sad true lover never find my grave,\n         To weep there.\n\nDUKE.\nThere’s for thy pains.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.\n\nDUKE.\nI’ll pay thy pleasure, then.\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.\n\nDUKE.\nGive me now leave to leave thee.\n\nCLOWN.\nNow the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything, and their intent everywhere, for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.\n\n[Exit Clown.]\n\nDUKE.\nLet all the rest give place.\n\n[Exeunt Curio and Attendants.]\n\nOnce more, Cesario,\nGet thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.\nTell her my love, more noble than the world,\nPrizes not quantity of dirty lands;\nThe parts that fortune hath bestow’d upon her,\nTell her I hold as giddily as fortune;\nBut ’tis that miracle and queen of gems\nThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.\n\nVIOLA.\nBut if she cannot love you, sir?\n\nDUKE.\nI cannot be so answer’d.\n\nVIOLA.\nSooth, but you must.\nSay that some lady, as perhaps there is,\nHath for your love as great a pang of heart\nAs you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;\nYou tell her so. Must she not then be answer’d?\n\nDUKE.\nThere is no woman’s sides\nCan bide the beating of so strong a passion\nAs love doth give my heart: no woman’s heart\nSo big, to hold so much; they lack retention.\nAlas, their love may be called appetite,\nNo motion of the liver, but the palate,\nThat suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;\nBut mine is all as hungry as the sea,\nAnd can digest as much.

She never told her love,\nBut let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,\nFeed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,\nAnd with a green and yellow melancholy\nShe sat like patience on a monument,\nSmiling at grief.

    "content":"SCENE V. Olivia’s garden.\nEnter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome thy ways, Signior Fabian.\n\nFABIAN.\nNay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?\n\nFABIAN.\nI would exult, man. You know he brought me out o’ favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo anger him we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir Andrew?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd we do not, it is pity of our lives.\n\nEnter Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHere comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India?\n\nMARIA.\nGet ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio’s coming down this walk; he has been yonder i’ the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting! [The men hide themselves.] Lie thou there; [Throws down a letter] for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.\n\n[Exit Maria.]\n\nEnter Malvolio.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think on’t?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHere’s an overweening rogue!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him; how he jets under his advanced plumes!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n’Slight, I could so beat the rogue!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPeace, I say.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nTo be Count Malvolio.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAh, rogue!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nPistol him, pistol him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPeace, peace.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThere is example for’t. The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFie on him, Jezebel!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace! now he’s deeply in; look how imagination blows him.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHaving been three months married to her, sitting in my state—\n\nSIR TOBY.\nO for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nCalling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nFire and brimstone!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace, peace.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAnd then to have the humour of state; and after a demure travel of regard, telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nBolts and shackles!\n\nFABIAN.\nO, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSeven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play with some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me—\n\nSIR TOBY.\nShall this fellow live?\n\nFABIAN.\nThough our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control—\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd does not Toby take you a blow o’ the lips then?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSaying ‘Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of speech—’\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhat, what?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘You must amend your drunkenness.’\n\nSIR TOBY.\nOut, scab!\n\nFABIAN.\nNay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight—’\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThat’s me, I warrant you.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘One Sir Andrew.’\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n[Taking up the letter.] What employment have we here?\n\nFABIAN.\nNow is the woodcock near the gin.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nO, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nBy my life, this is my lady’s hand: these be her very C’s, her U’s, and her T’s, and thus makes she her great P’s. It is in contempt of question, her hand.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nHer C’s, her U’s, and her T’s. Why that?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n[Reads.] To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes. Her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal: ’tis my lady. To whom should this be?\n\nFABIAN.\nThis wins him, liver and all.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n[Reads.]\n    Jove knows I love,\n    But who?\n    Lips, do not move,\n    No man must know.\n\n‘No man must know.’ What follows? The numbers alter’d! ‘No man must know.’—If this should be thee, Malvolio?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMarry, hang thee, brock!\n\nMALVOLIO.\n    I may command where I adore,\n    But silence, like a Lucrece knife,\n    With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;\n    M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.\n\nFABIAN.\nA fustian riddle!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nExcellent wench, say I.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.’—Nay, but first let me see, let me see, let me see.\n\nFABIAN.\nWhat dish o’ poison has she dressed him!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd with what wing the staniel checks at it!\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘I may command where I adore.’ Why, she may command me: I serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no obstruction in this. And the end—what should that alphabetical position portend? If I could make that resemble something in me! Softly! ‘M.O.A.I.’—\n\nSIR TOBY.\nO, ay, make up that:—he is now at a cold scent.\n\nFABIAN.\nSowter will cry upon’t for all this, though it be as rank as a fox.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘M’—Malvolio; ‘M!’ Why, that begins my name!\n\nFABIAN.\nDid not I say he would work it out? The cur is excellent at faults.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘M’—But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under probation: ‘A’ should follow, but ‘O’ does.\n\nFABIAN.\nAnd ‘O’ shall end, I hope.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAy, or I’ll cudgel him, and make him cry ‘O!’\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAnd then ‘I’ comes behind.\n\nFABIAN.\nAy, and you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you.\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘M.O.A.I.’ This simulation is not as the former: and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft, here follows prose.\n[Reads.] If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon ’em. Thy fates open their hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them. And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so. If not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune’s fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee,\n                    The Fortunate Unhappy.\n\nDaylight and champian discovers not more! This is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-device, the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised!—Here is yet a postscript. [Reads.] Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertain’st my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee. Jove, I thank thee. I will smile, I will do everything that thou wilt have me.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nFABIAN.\nI will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI could marry this wench for this device.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nSo could I too.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.\n\nEnter Maria.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNor I neither.\n\nFABIAN.\nHere comes my noble gull-catcher.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWilt thou set thy foot o’ my neck?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nOr o’ mine either?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nShall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bond-slave?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI’ faith, or I either?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.\n\nMARIA.\nNay, but say true, does it work upon him?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLike aqua-vitae with a midwife.\n\nMARIA.\nIf you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady: he will come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a colour she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI’ll make one too.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Dost thou live by thy tabor?\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, sir, I live by the church.\n\nVIOLA.\nArt thou a churchman?\n\nCLOWN.\nNo such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.\n\nVIOLA.\nSo thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.\n\nCLOWN.\nYou have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev’ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!\n\nVIOLA.\nNay, that’s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.\n\nCLOWN.\nI would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhy, man?\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, sir, her name’s a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals, since bonds disgraced them.\n\nVIOLA.\nThy reason, man?\n\nCLOWN.\nTroth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.\n\nVIOLA.\nI warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car’st for nothing.\n\nCLOWN.\nNot so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.\n\nVIOLA.\nArt not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool, sir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings, the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.\n\nVIOLA.\nI saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.\n\nCLOWN.\nFoolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there.\n\nVIOLA.\nNay, and thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with thee. Hold, there’s expenses for thee.\n\nCLOWN.\nNow Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!\n\nVIOLA.\nBy my troth, I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?\n\nCLOWN.\nWould not a pair of these have bred, sir?\n\nVIOLA.\nYes, being kept together, and put to use.\n\nCLOWN.\nI would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.\n\nVIOLA.\nI understand you, sir; ’tis well begged.\n\nCLOWN.\nThe matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say “element”, but the word is overworn.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nVIOLA.\nThis fellow is wise enough to play the fool,\nAnd to do that well, craves a kind of wit:\nHe must observe their mood on whom he jests,\nThe quality of persons, and the time,\nAnd like the haggard, check at every feather\nThat comes before his eye. This is a practice\nAs full of labour as a wise man’s art:\nFor folly, that he wisely shows, is fit;\nBut wise men, folly-fall’n, quite taint their wit.\n\nEnter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSave you, gentleman.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd you, sir.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nDieu vous garde, monsieur.\n\nVIOLA.\nEt vous aussi; votre serviteur.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWill you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.\n\nVIOLA.\nI am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the list of my voyage.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTaste your legs, sir, put them to motion.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI mean, to go, sir, to enter.\n\nVIOLA.\nI will answer you with gait and entrance: but we are prevented.\n\nEnter Olivia and Maria.\n\nMost excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThat youth’s a rare courtier. ‘Rain odours,’ well.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n‘Odours,’ ‘pregnant,’ and ‘vouchsafed.’—I’ll get ’em all three ready.\n\nOLIVIA.\nLet the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.\n\n[Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Maria.]\n\nGive me your hand, sir.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy duty, madam, and most humble service.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat is your name?\n\nVIOLA.\nCesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.\n\nOLIVIA.\nMy servant, sir! ’Twas never merry world,\nSince lowly feigning was call’d compliment:\nY’are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd he is yours, and his must needs be yours.\nYour servant’s servant is your servant, madam.\n\nOLIVIA.\nFor him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,\nWould they were blanks rather than fill’d with me!\n\nVIOLA.\nMadam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts\nOn his behalf.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, by your leave, I pray you.\nI bade you never speak again of him.\nBut would you undertake another suit,\nI had rather hear you to solicit that\nThan music from the spheres.\n\nVIOLA.\nDear lady—\n\nOLIVIA.\nGive me leave, beseech you. I did send,\nAfter the last enchantment you did here,\nA ring in chase of you. So did I abuse\nMyself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.\nUnder your hard construction must I sit;\nTo force that on you in a shameful cunning,\nWhich you knew none of yours. What might you think?\nHave you not set mine honour at the stake,\nAnd baited it with all th’ unmuzzled thoughts\nThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving\nEnough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,\nHides my heart: so let me hear you speak.\n\nVIOLA.\nI pity you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nThat’s a degree to love.\n\nVIOLA.\nNo, not a grize; for ’tis a vulgar proof\nThat very oft we pity enemies.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy then methinks ’tis time to smile again.\nO world, how apt the poor are to be proud!\nIf one should be a prey, how much the better\nTo fall before the lion than the wolf! [Clock strikes.]\nThe clock upbraids me with the waste of time.\nBe not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.\nAnd yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,\nYour wife is like to reap a proper man.\nThere lies your way, due west.\n\nVIOLA.\nThen westward ho!\nGrace and good disposition attend your ladyship!\nYou’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?\n\nOLIVIA.\nStay:\nI prithee tell me what thou think’st of me.\n\nVIOLA.\nThat you do think you are not what you are.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIf I think so, I think the same of you.\n\nVIOLA.\nThen think you right; I am not what I am.\n\nOLIVIA.\nI would you were as I would have you be.\n\nVIOLA.\nWould it be better, madam, than I am?\nI wish it might, for now I am your fool.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO what a deal of scorn looks beautiful\nIn the contempt and anger of his lip!\nA murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon\nThan love that would seem hid. Love’s night is noon.\nCesario, by the roses of the spring,\nBy maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,\nI love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,\nNor wit nor reason can my passion hide.\nDo not extort thy reasons from this clause,\nFor that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;\nBut rather reason thus with reason fetter:\nLove sought is good, but given unsought is better.\n\nVIOLA.\nBy innocence I swear, and by my youth,\nI have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,\nAnd that no woman has; nor never none\nShall mistress be of it, save I alone.\nAnd so adieu, good madam; never more\nWill I my master’s tears to you deplore.\n\nOLIVIA.\nYet come again: for thou perhaps mayst move\nThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Tell me that.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAs plain as I see you now.\n\nFABIAN.\nThis was a great argument of love in her toward you.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n’Slight! will you make an ass o’ me?\n\nFABIAN.\nI will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.\n\nFABIAN.\nShe did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt, either of valour or policy.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd’t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places; my niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valour.\n\nFABIAN.\nThere is no way but this, Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWill either of you bear me a challenge to him?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGo, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the licence of ink. If thou ‘thou’st’ him some thrice, it shall not be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nWhere shall I find you?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWe’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.\n\n[Exit Sir Andrew.]\n\nFABIAN.\nThis is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.\n\nFABIAN.\nWe shall have a rare letter from him; but you’ll not deliver it.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNever trust me then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy.\n\nFABIAN.\nAnd his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.\n\nEnter Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nLook where the youngest wren of nine comes.\n\nMARIA.\nIf you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow stockings.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAnd cross-gartered?\n\nMARIA.\nMost villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i’ th’ church. I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll smile and take’t for a great favour.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, bring us, bring us where he is.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

What is the matter with thee?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nNot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nTo bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGod comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft?\n\nMARIA.\nHow do you, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAt your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws!\n\nMARIA.\nWhy appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘Be not afraid of greatness.’ ’Twas well writ.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat mean’st thou by that, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘Some are born great’—\n\nOLIVIA.\nHa?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘Some achieve greatness’—\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat say’st thou?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘And some have greatness thrust upon them.’\n\nOLIVIA.\nHeaven restore thee!\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘Remember who commended thy yellow stockings’—\n\nOLIVIA.\nThy yellow stockings?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘And wished to see thee cross-gartered.’\n\nOLIVIA.\nCross-gartered?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘Go to: thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so:’—\n\nOLIVIA.\nAm I made?\n\nMALVOLIO.\n‘If not, let me see thee a servant still.’\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhy, this is very midsummer madness.\n\nEnter Servant.\n\nSERVANT.\nMadam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned; I could hardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship’s pleasure.\n\nOLIVIA.\nI’ll come to him.\n\n[Exit Servant.]\n\nGood Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.\n\n[Exeunt Olivia and Maria.]\n\nMALVOLIO.\nO ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. ‘Cast thy humble slough,’ says she; ‘be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the trick of singularity,’ and consequently, sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, ‘Let this fellow be looked to;’ ‘Fellow!’ not ‘Malvolio’, nor after my degree, but ‘fellow’. Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance. What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.\n\nEnter Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhich way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.\n\nFABIAN.\nHere he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? How is’t with you, man?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGo off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private. Go off.\n\nMARIA.\nLo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAh, ha! does she so?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGo to, go to; peace, peace, we must deal gently with him. Let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? How is’t with you? What, man! defy the devil! Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nDo you know what you say?\n\nMARIA.\nLa you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not bewitched.\n\nFABIAN.\nCarry his water to th’ wise woman.\n\nMARIA.\nMarry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nHow now, mistress!\n\nMARIA.\nO Lord!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nPrithee hold thy peace, this is not the way. Do you not see you move him? Let me alone with him.\n\nFABIAN.\nNo way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough, and will not be roughly used.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, how now, my bawcock? How dost thou, chuck?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAy, biddy, come with me. What, man, ’tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!\n\nMARIA.\nGet him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMy prayers, minx?\n\nMARIA.\nNo, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGo, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am not of your element. You shall know more hereafter.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nIs’t possible?\n\nFABIAN.\nIf this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHis very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.\n\nMARIA.\nNay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.\n\nFABIAN.\nWhy, we shall make him mad indeed.\n\nMARIA.\nThe house will be the quieter.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad. We may carry it thus for our pleasure, and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we will bring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see!\n\nEnter Sir Andrew.\n\nFABIAN.\nMore matter for a May morning.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nHere’s the challenge, read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in’t.\n\nFABIAN.\nIs’t so saucy?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAy, is’t, I warrant him. Do but read.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGive me. [Reads.] Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.\n\nFABIAN.\nGood, and valiant.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for’t.\n\nFABIAN.\nA good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.\n\nFABIAN.\nVery brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me—\n\nFABIAN.\nGood.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain.\n\nFABIAN.\nStill you keep o’ th’ windy side of the law. Good.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nFare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,\n                        Andrew Aguecheek.\nIf this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll give’t him.\n\nMARIA.\nYou may have very fit occasion for’t. He is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGo, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard, like a bum-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw’st, swear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nNay, let me alone for swearing.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nNow will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.\n\nEnter Olivia and Viola.\n\nFABIAN.\nHere he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.\n\n[Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria.]\n\nOLIVIA.\nI have said too much unto a heart of stone,\nAnd laid mine honour too unchary on’t:\nThere’s something in me that reproves my fault:\nBut such a headstrong potent fault it is,\nThat it but mocks reproof.\n\nVIOLA.\nWith the same ’haviour that your passion bears\nGoes on my master’s griefs.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHere, wear this jewel for me, ’tis my picture.\nRefuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you.\nAnd I beseech you come again tomorrow.\nWhat shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,\nThat honour sav’d, may upon asking give?\n\nVIOLA.\nNothing but this, your true love for my master.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHow with mine honour may I give him that\nWhich I have given to you?\n\nVIOLA.\nI will acquit you.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWell, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well;\nA fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Sir Toby and Fabian.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nGentleman, God save thee.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd you, sir.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThat defence thou hast, betake thee to’t. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly.\n\nVIOLA.\nYou mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nYou’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal.\n\nVIOLA.\nI pray you, sir, what is he?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nHe is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob is his word; give’t or take’t.\n\nVIOLA.\nI will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirk.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nSir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.\n\nVIOLA.\nThis is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.\n\n[Exit Sir Toby.]\n\nVIOLA.\nPray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\n\nFABIAN.\nI know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.\n\nVIOLA.\nI beseech you, what manner of man is he?\n\nFABIAN.\nNothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.\n\nVIOLA.\nI shall be much bound to you for’t. I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I care not who knows so much of my mettle.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nEnter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWhy, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nPox on’t, I’ll not meddle with him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nAy, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nPlague on’t, an I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on’t. This shall end without the perdition of souls. [Aside.] Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.\n\nEnter Fabian and Viola.\n\n[To Fabian.] I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth’s a devil.\n\nFABIAN.\nHe is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThere’s no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for’s oath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.\n\nVIOLA.\n[Aside.] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.\n\nFABIAN.\nGive ground if you see him furious.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy, the gentleman will for his honour’s sake have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it; but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on: to’t.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n[Draws.] Pray God he keep his oath!\n\nEnter Antonio.\n\nVIOLA.\n[Draws.] I do assure you ’tis against my will.\n\nANTONIO.\nPut up your sword. If this young gentleman\nHave done offence, I take the fault on me.\nIf you offend him, I for him defy you.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nYou, sir? Why, what are you?\n\nANTONIO.\n[Draws.] One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more\nThan you have heard him brag to you he will.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[Draws.] Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.\n\nEnter Officers.\n\nFABIAN.\nO good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.\n\nSIR TOBY.\n[To Antonio.] I’ll be with you anon.\n\nVIOLA.\n[To Sir Andrew.] Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nMarry, will I, sir; and for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you easily, and reins well.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nThis is the man; do thy office.\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nAntonio, I arrest thee at the suit\nOf Count Orsino.\n\nANTONIO.\nYou do mistake me, sir.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nNo, sir, no jot. I know your favour well,\nThough now you have no sea-cap on your head.—\nTake him away, he knows I know him well.\n\nANTONIO.\nI must obey. This comes with seeking you;\nBut there’s no remedy, I shall answer it.\nWhat will you do? Now my necessity\nMakes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me\nMuch more for what I cannot do for you,\nThan what befalls myself. You stand amaz’d,\nBut be of comfort.\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nCome, sir, away.\n\nANTONIO.\nI must entreat of you some of that money.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhat money, sir?\nFor the fair kindness you have show’d me here,\nAnd part being prompted by your present trouble,\nOut of my lean and low ability\nI’ll lend you something. My having is not much;\nI’ll make division of my present with you.\nHold, there’s half my coffer.\n\nANTONIO.\nWill you deny me now?\nIs’t possible that my deserts to you\nCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,\nLest that it make me so unsound a man\nAs to upbraid you with those kindnesses\nThat I have done for you.\n\nVIOLA.\nI know of none,\nNor know I you by voice or any feature.\nI hate ingratitude more in a man\nThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,\nOr any taint of vice whose strong corruption\nInhabits our frail blood.\n\nANTONIO.\nO heavens themselves!\n\nSECOND OFFICER.\nCome, sir, I pray you go.\n\nANTONIO.\nLet me speak a little. This youth that you see here\nI snatch’d one half out of the jaws of death,\nReliev’d him with such sanctity of love;\nAnd to his image, which methought did promise\nMost venerable worth, did I devotion.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nWhat’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!\n\nANTONIO.\nBut O how vile an idol proves this god!\nThou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.\nIn nature there’s no blemish but the mind;\nNone can be call’d deform’d but the unkind.\nVirtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil\nAre empty trunks, o’erflourished by the devil.\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nThe man grows mad, away with him. Come, come, sir.\n\nANTONIO.\nLead me on.\n\n[Exeunt Officers with Antonio.]\n\nVIOLA.\nMethinks his words do from such passion fly\nThat he believes himself; so do not I.\nProve true, imagination, O prove true,\nThat I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nCome hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We’ll whisper o’er a couplet or two of most sage saws.\n\nVIOLA.\nHe nam’d Sebastian. I my brother know\nYet living in my glass; even such and so\nIn favour was my brother, and he went\nStill in this fashion, colour, ornament,\nFor him I imitate. O if it prove,\nTempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nSIR TOBY.\nA very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity, and denying him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.\n\nFABIAN.\nA coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nDo, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nAnd I do not—\n\n[Exit.]\n\nFABIAN.\nCome, let’s see the event.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nI dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so, is so.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI prithee vent thy folly somewhere else,\nThou know’st not me.\n\nCLOWN.\nVent my folly!

    "content":"SCENE II. A Room in Olivia’s House.\nEnter Maria and Clown.\n\nMARIA.\nNay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.\n\n[Exit Maria.]\n\nCLOWN.\nWell, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in’t, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student, but to be said, an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say, a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.\n\nEnter Sir Toby and Maria.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nJove bless thee, Master Parson.\n\nCLOWN.\nBonos dies, Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, ‘That that is, is’: so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is ‘that’ but ‘that’? and ‘is’ but ‘is’?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo him, Sir Topas.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat ho, I say! Peace in this prison!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThe knave counterfeits well. A good knave.\n\nMalvolio within.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nWho calls there?\n\nCLOWN.\nSir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.\n\nCLOWN.\nOut, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man? Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWell said, Master Parson.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness.\n\nCLOWN.\nFie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Say’st thou that house is dark?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAs hell, Sir Topas.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of obstruction?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.\n\nCLOWN.\nMadman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any constant question.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThat the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhat think’st thou of his opinion?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.\n\nCLOWN.\nFare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas, Sir Topas!\n\nSIR TOBY.\nMy most exquisite Sir Topas!\n\nCLOWN.\nNay, I am for all waters.\n\nMARIA.\nThou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown. He sees thee not.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nTo him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find’st him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.\n\n[Exeunt Sir Toby and Maria.]\n\nCLOWN.\n[Singing.]\n    Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,\n    Tell me how thy lady does.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool!\n\nCLOWN.\n    My lady is unkind, perdy.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool!\n\nCLOWN.\n    Alas, why is she so?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool, I say!\n\nCLOWN.\n    She loves another—\nWho calls, ha?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGood fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for’t.\n\nCLOWN.\nMaster Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nAy, good fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nAlas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool, there was never man so notoriously abused. I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nThey have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my wits.\n\nCLOWN.\nAdvise you what you say: the minister is here. [As Sir Topas] Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore. Endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nSir Topas!\n\nCLOWN.\n[As Sir Topas] Maintain no words with him, good fellow. [As himself] Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God buy you, good Sir Topas. [As Sir Topas] Marry, amen. [As himself] I will sir, I will.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool, fool, fool, I say!\n\nCLOWN.\nAlas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking to you.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nGood fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.\n\nCLOWN.\nWell-a-day that you were, sir!\n\nMALVOLIO.\nBy this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.\n\nCLOWN.\nI will help you to’t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nBelieve me, I am not. I tell thee true.\n\nCLOWN.\nNay, I’ll ne’er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nFool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree: I prithee be gone.\n\nCLOWN.\n[Singing.]\n  I am gone, sir, and anon, sir,\n    I’ll be with you again,\n  In a trice, like to the old Vice,\n    Your need to sustain;\n  Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath,\n    Cries ‘ah, ha!’ to the devil:\n  Like a mad lad, ‘Pare thy nails, dad.\n    Adieu, goodman devil.’\n\n[Exit.]",

Olivia’s Garden.\nEnter Sebastian.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nThis is the air; that is the glorious sun,\nThis pearl she gave me, I do feel’t and see’t,\nAnd though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,\nYet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then?\nI could not find him at the Elephant,\nYet there he was, and there I found this credit,\nThat he did range the town to seek me out.\nHis counsel now might do me golden service.\nFor though my soul disputes well with my sense\nThat this may be some error, but no madness,\nYet doth this accident and flood of fortune\nSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,\nThat I am ready to distrust mine eyes\nAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades me\nTo any other trust but that I am mad,\nOr else the lady’s mad; yet if ’twere so,\nShe could not sway her house, command her followers,\nTake and give back affairs and their dispatch,\nWith such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing\nAs I perceive she does. There’s something in’t\nThat is deceivable. But here the lady comes.\n\nEnter Olivia and a Priest.\n\nOLIVIA.\nBlame not this haste of mine.

He shall conceal it\nWhiles you are willing it shall come to note,\nWhat time we will our celebration keep\nAccording to my birth. What do you say?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI’ll follow this good man, and go with you,\nAnd having sworn truth, ever will be true.\n\nOLIVIA.\nThen lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine,\nThat they may fairly note this act of mine!\n\n[Exeunt.]",

How dost thou, my good fellow?\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, sir, the better for my foes, and the worse for my friends.\n\nDUKE.\nJust the contrary; the better for thy friends.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, sir, the worse.\n\nDUKE.\nHow can that be?\n\nCLOWN.\nMarry, sir, they praise me, and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then, the worse for my friends, and the better for my foes.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy, this is excellent.\n\nCLOWN.\nBy my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends.\n\nDUKE.\nThou shalt not be the worse for me; there’s gold.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.\n\nDUKE.\nO, you give me ill counsel.\n\nCLOWN.\nPut your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.\n\nDUKE.\nWell, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: there’s another.\n\nCLOWN.\nPrimo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all; the triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.\n\nDUKE.\nYou can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.\n\nCLOWN.\nMarry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness: but as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.\n\n[Exit Clown.]\n\nEnter Antonio and Officers.\n\nVIOLA.\nHere comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.\n\nDUKE.\nThat face of his I do remember well.\nYet when I saw it last it was besmear’d\nAs black as Vulcan, in the smoke of war.\nA baubling vessel was he captain of,\nFor shallow draught and bulk unprizable,\nWith which such scathful grapple did he make\nWith the most noble bottom of our fleet,\nThat very envy and the tongue of loss\nCried fame and honour on him. What’s the matter?\n\nFIRST OFFICER.\nOrsino, this is that Antonio\nThat took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,\nAnd this is he that did the Tiger board\nWhen your young nephew Titus lost his leg.\nHere in the streets, desperate of shame and state,\nIn private brabble did we apprehend him.\n\nVIOLA.\nHe did me kindness, sir; drew on my side,\nBut in conclusion, put strange speech upon me.\nI know not what ’twas, but distraction.\n\nDUKE.\nNotable pirate, thou salt-water thief,\nWhat foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,\nWhom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,\nHast made thine enemies?\n\nANTONIO.\nOrsino, noble sir,\nBe pleased that I shake off these names you give me:\nAntonio never yet was thief or pirate,\nThough, I confess, on base and ground enough,\nOrsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:\nThat most ingrateful boy there by your side\nFrom the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth\nDid I redeem; a wreck past hope he was.\nHis life I gave him, and did thereto add\nMy love, without retention or restraint,\nAll his in dedication. For his sake\nDid I expose myself, pure for his love,\nInto the danger of this adverse town;\nDrew to defend him when he was beset;\nWhere being apprehended, his false cunning\n(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)\nTaught him to face me out of his acquaintance,\nAnd grew a twenty years’ removed thing\nWhile one would wink; denied me mine own purse,\nWhich I had recommended to his use\nNot half an hour before.\n\nVIOLA.\nHow can this be?\n\nDUKE.\nWhen came he to this town?\n\nANTONIO.\nToday, my lord; and for three months before,\nNo int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy,\nBoth day and night did we keep company.\n\nEnter Olivia and Attendants.\n\nDUKE.\nHere comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth.\nBut for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness.\nThree months this youth hath tended upon me;\nBut more of that anon. Take him aside.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat would my lord, but that he may not have,\nWherein Olivia may seem serviceable?\nCesario, you do not keep promise with me.\n\nVIOLA.\nMadam?\n\nDUKE.\nGracious Olivia—\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat do you say, Cesario? Good my lord—\n\nVIOLA.\nMy lord would speak, my duty hushes me.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIf it be aught to the old tune, my lord,\nIt is as fat and fulsome to mine ear\nAs howling after music.\n\nDUKE.\nStill so cruel?\n\nOLIVIA.\nStill so constant, lord.\n\nDUKE.\nWhat, to perverseness? You uncivil lady,\nTo whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\nMy soul the faithfull’st off’rings hath breathed out\nThat e’er devotion tender’d! What shall I do?\n\nOLIVIA.\nEven what it please my lord that shall become him.\n\nDUKE.\nWhy should I not, had I the heart to do it,\nLike to the Egyptian thief at point of death,\nKill what I love?—a savage jealousy\nThat sometime savours nobly. But hear me this:\nSince you to non-regardance cast my faith,\nAnd that I partly know the instrument\nThat screws me from my true place in your favour,\nLive you the marble-breasted tyrant still.\nBut this your minion, whom I know you love,\nAnd whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\nHim will I tear out of that cruel eye\nWhere he sits crowned in his master’s spite.—\nCome, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:\nI’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,\nTo spite a raven’s heart within a dove.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,\nTo do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhere goes Cesario?\n\nVIOLA.\nAfter him I love\nMore than I love these eyes, more than my life,\nMore, by all mores, than e’er I shall love wife.\nIf I do feign, you witnesses above\nPunish my life for tainting of my love.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAh me, detested! how am I beguil’d!\n\nVIOLA.\nWho does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?\n\nOLIVIA.\nHast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?\nCall forth the holy father.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nDUKE.\n[To Viola.] Come, away!\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\n\nDUKE.\nHusband?\n\nOLIVIA.\nAy, husband. Can he that deny?\n\nDUKE.\nHer husband, sirrah?\n\nVIOLA.\nNo, my lord, not I.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAlas, it is the baseness of thy fear\nThat makes thee strangle thy propriety.\nFear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up.\nBe that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art\nAs great as that thou fear’st.\n\nEnter Priest.\n\nO, welcome, father!\nFather, I charge thee, by thy reverence\nHere to unfold—though lately we intended\nTo keep in darkness what occasion now\nReveals before ’tis ripe—what thou dost know\nHath newly passed between this youth and me.\n\nPRIEST.\nA contract of eternal bond of love,\nConfirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,\nAttested by the holy close of lips,\nStrengthen’d by interchangement of your rings,\nAnd all the ceremony of this compact\nSealed in my function, by my testimony;\nSince when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave,\nI have travelled but two hours.\n\nDUKE.\nO thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be\nWhen time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?\nOr will not else thy craft so quickly grow\nThat thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?\nFarewell, and take her; but direct thy feet\nWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.\n\nVIOLA.\nMy lord, I do protest—\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, do not swear.\nHold little faith, though thou has too much fear.\n\nEnter Sir Andrew.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nFor the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n’Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.\n\nOLIVIA.\nWho has done this, Sir Andrew?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nThe Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate.\n\nDUKE.\nMy gentleman, Cesario?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\n’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do’t by Sir Toby.\n\nVIOLA.\nWhy do you speak to me? I never hurt you:\nYou drew your sword upon me without cause,\nBut I bespake you fair and hurt you not.\n\nEnter Sir Toby, drunk, led by the Clown.\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nIf a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting, you shall hear more: but if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you othergates than he did.\n\nDUKE.\nHow now, gentleman? How is’t with you?\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThat’s all one; ’has hurt me, and there’s th’ end on’t. Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?\n\nCLOWN.\nO, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i’ th’ morning.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nThen he’s a rogue, and a passy measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAway with him. Who hath made this havoc with them?\n\nSIR ANDREW.\nI’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.\n\nSIR TOBY.\nWill you help? An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull?\n\nOLIVIA.\nGet him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.\n\n[Exeunt Clown, Fabian, Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.]\n\nEnter Sebastian.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;\nBut had it been the brother of my blood,\nI must have done no less with wit and safety.\nYou throw a strange regard upon me, and by that\nI do perceive it hath offended you.\nPardon me, sweet one, even for the vows\nWe made each other but so late ago.\n\nDUKE.\nOne face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!\nA natural perspective, that is, and is not!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAntonio, O my dear Antonio!\nHow have the hours rack’d and tortur’d me\nSince I have lost thee.\n\nANTONIO.\nSebastian are you?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nFear’st thou that, Antonio?\n\nANTONIO.\nHow have you made division of yourself?\nAn apple cleft in two is not more twin\nThan these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?\n\nOLIVIA.\nMost wonderful!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nDo I stand there? I never had a brother:\nNor can there be that deity in my nature\nOf here and everywhere. I had a sister,\nWhom the blind waves and surges have devoured.\nOf charity, what kin are you to me?\nWhat countryman? What name? What parentage?\n\nVIOLA.\nOf Messaline: Sebastian was my father;\nSuch a Sebastian was my brother too:\nSo went he suited to his watery tomb.\nIf spirits can assume both form and suit,\nYou come to fright us.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA spirit I am indeed,\nBut am in that dimension grossly clad,\nWhich from the womb I did participate.\nWere you a woman, as the rest goes even,\nI should my tears let fall upon your cheek,\nAnd say, ‘Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.’\n\nVIOLA.\nMy father had a mole upon his brow.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAnd so had mine.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd died that day when Viola from her birth\nHad numbered thirteen years.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nO, that record is lively in my soul!\nHe finished indeed his mortal act\nThat day that made my sister thirteen years.\n\nVIOLA.\nIf nothing lets to make us happy both\nBut this my masculine usurp’d attire,\nDo not embrace me till each circumstance\nOf place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump\nThat I am Viola; which to confirm,\nI’ll bring you to a captain in this town,\nWhere lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help\nI was preserv’d to serve this noble count.\nAll the occurrence of my fortune since\nHath been between this lady and this lord.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n[To Olivia.] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.\nBut nature to her bias drew in that.\nYou would have been contracted to a maid;\nNor are you therein, by my life, deceived:\nYou are betroth’d both to a maid and man.\n\nDUKE.\nBe not amazed; right noble is his blood.\nIf this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\nI shall have share in this most happy wreck.\n[To Viola.] Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times\nThou never shouldst love woman like to me.\n\nVIOLA.\nAnd all those sayings will I over-swear,\nAnd all those swearings keep as true in soul\nAs doth that orbed continent the fire\nThat severs day from night.\n\nDUKE.\nGive me thy hand,\nAnd let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.\n\nVIOLA.\nThe captain that did bring me first on shore\nHath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action,\nIs now in durance, at Malvolio’s suit,\nA gentleman and follower of my lady’s.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHe shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither.\nAnd yet, alas, now I remember me,\nThey say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract.\n\nEnter Clown, with a letter and Fabian.\n\nA most extracting frenzy of mine own\nFrom my remembrance clearly banished his.\nHow does he, sirrah?\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave’s end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here writ a letter to you. I should have given it you today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.\n\nOLIVIA.\nOpen ’t, and read it.\n\nCLOWN.\nLook then to be well edified, when the fool delivers the madman. By the Lord, madam,—\n\nOLIVIA.\nHow now, art thou mad?\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox.\n\nOLIVIA.\nPrithee, read i’ thy right wits.\n\nCLOWN.\nSo I do, madonna. But to read his right wits is to read thus; therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.\n\nOLIVIA.\n[To Fabian.] Read it you, sirrah.\n\nFABIAN.\n[Reads.] By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of my injury.\n                        The madly-used Malvolio.\n\nOLIVIA.\nDid he write this?\n\nCLOWN.\nAy, madam.\n\nDUKE.\nThis savours not much of distraction.\n\nOLIVIA.\nSee him delivered, Fabian, bring him hither.\n\n[Exit Fabian.]\n\nMy lord, so please you, these things further thought on,\nTo think me as well a sister, as a wife,\nOne day shall crown th’ alliance on’t, so please you,\nHere at my house, and at my proper cost.\n\nDUKE.\nMadam, I am most apt t’ embrace your offer.\n[To Viola.] Your master quits you; and for your service done him,\nSo much against the mettle of your sex,\nSo far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\nAnd since you call’d me master for so long,\nHere is my hand; you shall from this time be\nYour master’s mistress.\n\nOLIVIA.\nA sister? You are she.\n\nEnter Fabian and Malvolio.\n\nDUKE.\nIs this the madman?\n\nOLIVIA.\nAy, my lord, this same.\nHow now, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMadam, you have done me wrong,\nNotorious wrong.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHave I, Malvolio? No.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nLady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.\nYou must not now deny it is your hand,\nWrite from it, if you can, in hand, or phrase,\nOr say ’tis not your seal, not your invention:\nYou can say none of this. Well, grant it then,\nAnd tell me, in the modesty of honour,\nWhy you have given me such clear lights of favour,\nBade me come smiling and cross-garter’d to you,\nTo put on yellow stockings, and to frown\nUpon Sir Toby, and the lighter people;\nAnd acting this in an obedient hope,\nWhy have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,\nKept in a dark house, visited by the priest,\nAnd made the most notorious geck and gull\nThat e’er invention played on? Tell me why?\n\nOLIVIA.\nAlas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,\nThough I confess, much like the character:\nBut out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.\nAnd now I do bethink me, it was she\nFirst told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,\nAnd in such forms which here were presuppos’d\nUpon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.\nThis practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee.\nBut when we know the grounds and authors of it,\nThou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge\nOf thine own cause.\n\nFABIAN.\nGood madam, hear me speak,\nAnd let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come,\nTaint the condition of this present hour,\nWhich I have wonder’d at. In hope it shall not,\nMost freely I confess, myself and Toby\nSet this device against Malvolio here,\nUpon some stubborn and uncourteous parts\nWe had conceiv’d against him. Maria writ\nThe letter, at Sir Toby’s great importance,\nIn recompense whereof he hath married her.\nHow with a sportful malice it was follow’d\nMay rather pluck on laughter than revenge,\nIf that the injuries be justly weigh’d\nThat have on both sides passed.\n\nOLIVIA.\nAlas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, ‘some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.’ I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but that’s all one. ‘By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.’ But do you remember? ‘Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? And you smile not, he’s gagged’? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.\n\nMALVOLIO.\nI’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOLIVIA.\nHe hath been most notoriously abus’d.\n\nDUKE.\nPursue him, and entreat him to a peace:\nHe hath not told us of the captain yet.\nWhen that is known, and golden time convents,\nA solemn combination shall be made\nOf our dear souls.—Meantime, sweet sister,\nWe will not part from hence.—Cesario, come:\nFor so you shall be while you are a man;\nBut when in other habits you are seen,\nOrsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nClown sings.\n\n   When that I was and a little tiny boy,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   A foolish thing was but a toy,\n     For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n   But when I came to man’s estate,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   ’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,\n     For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n   But when I came, alas, to wive,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   By swaggering could I never thrive,\n     For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n   But when I came unto my beds,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   With toss-pots still had drunken heads,\n     For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n   A great while ago the world begun,\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n   But that’s all one, our play is done,\n     And we’ll strive to please you every day.\n\n[Exit.]",
