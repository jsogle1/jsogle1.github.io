    "content":"SCENE: Britain\nACT I\nSCENE I. A Room of State in King Lear’s Palace\nEnter Kent, Gloucester and Edmund.\n\nKENT.\nI thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nIt did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.\n\nKENT.\nIs not this your son, my lord?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHis breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blush’d to acknowledge him that now I am braz’d to’t.\n\nKENT.\nI cannot conceive you.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nSir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?\n\nKENT.\nI cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nBut I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?\n\nEDMUND.\nNo, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nMy Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.\n\nEDMUND.\nMy services to your lordship.\n\nKENT.\nI must love you, and sue to know you better.\n\nEDMUND.\nSir, I shall study deserving.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHe hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King is coming.\n\n[Sennet within.]\n\nEnter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants.\n\nLEAR.\nAttend the lords of France and Burgundy,\nGloucester.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI shall, my lord.\n\n[Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund.]\n\nLEAR.\nMeantime we shall express our darker purpose.\nGive me the map there. Know that we have divided\nIn three our kingdom: and ’tis our fast intent\nTo shake all cares and business from our age;\nConferring them on younger strengths, while we\nUnburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\nAnd you, our no less loving son of Albany,\nWe have this hour a constant will to publish\nOur daughters’ several dowers, that future strife\nMay be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,\nGreat rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,\nLong in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\nAnd here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters,—\nSince now we will divest us both of rule,\nInterest of territory, cares of state,—\nWhich of you shall we say doth love us most?\nThat we our largest bounty may extend\nWhere nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril,\nOur eldest born, speak first.\n\nGONERIL.\nSir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;\nDearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;\nBeyond what can be valu’d, rich or rare;\nNo less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\nAs much as child e’er lov’d, or father found;\nA love that makes breath poor and speech unable;\nBeyond all manner of so much I love you.\n\nCORDELIA.\n[Aside.] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.\n\nLEAR.\nOf all these bounds, even from this line to this,\nWith shadowy forests and with champains rich’d,\nWith plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\nWe make thee lady: to thine and Albany’s issue\nBe this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,\nOur dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.\n\nREGAN.\nSir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister,\nAnd prize me at her worth. In my true heart\nI find she names my very deed of love;\nOnly she comes too short, that I profess\nMyself an enemy to all other joys\nWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,\nAnd find I am alone felicitate\nIn your dear highness’ love.\n\nCORDELIA.\n[Aside.] Then poor Cordelia,\nAnd yet not so; since, I am sure, my love’s\nMore ponderous than my tongue.\n\nLEAR.\nTo thee and thine hereditary ever\nRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom;\nNo less in space, validity, and pleasure\nThan that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy,\nAlthough the last and least; to whose young love\nThe vines of France and milk of Burgundy\nStrive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw\nA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\n\nCORDELIA.\nNothing, my lord.\n\nLEAR.\nNothing?\n\nCORDELIA.\nNothing.\n\nLEAR.\nNothing will come of nothing: speak again.\n\nCORDELIA.\nUnhappy that I am, I cannot heave\nMy heart into my mouth: I love your majesty\nAccording to my bond; no more nor less.\n\nLEAR.\nHow, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,\nLest you may mar your fortunes.\n\nCORDELIA.\nGood my lord,\nYou have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I\nReturn those duties back as are right fit,\nObey you, love you, and most honour you.\nWhy have my sisters husbands if they say\nThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\nThat lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\nHalf my love with him, half my care and duty:\nSure I shall never marry like my sisters,\nTo love my father all.\n\nLEAR.\nBut goes thy heart with this?\n\nCORDELIA.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nLEAR.\nSo young, and so untender?\n\nCORDELIA.\nSo young, my lord, and true.\n\nLEAR.\nLet it be so, thy truth then be thy dower:\nFor, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\nThe mysteries of Hecate and the night;\nBy all the operation of the orbs,\nFrom whom we do exist and cease to be;\nHere I disclaim all my paternal care,\nPropinquity and property of blood,\nAnd as a stranger to my heart and me\nHold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\nOr he that makes his generation messes\nTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\nBe as well neighbour’d, pitied, and reliev’d,\nAs thou my sometime daughter.\n\nKENT.\nGood my liege,—\n\nLEAR.\nPeace, Kent!\nCome not between the dragon and his wrath.\nI lov’d her most, and thought to set my rest\nOn her kind nursery. [To Cordelia.] Hence and avoid my sight!\nSo be my grave my peace, as here I give\nHer father’s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?\nCall Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,\nWith my two daughters’ dowers digest this third:\nLet pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\nI do invest you jointly with my power,\nPre-eminence, and all the large effects\nThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,\nWith reservation of an hundred knights,\nBy you to be sustain’d, shall our abode\nMake with you by due turn. Only we shall retain\nThe name, and all the addition to a king; the sway,\nRevenue, execution of the rest,\nBeloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,\nThis coronet part between you.\n\n[Giving the crown.]\n\nKENT.\nRoyal Lear,\nWhom I have ever honour’d as my king,\nLov’d as my father, as my master follow’d,\nAs my great patron thought on in my prayers.—\n\nLEAR.\nThe bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.\n\nKENT.\nLet it fall rather, though the fork invade\nThe region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly\nWhen Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?\nThink’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,\nWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound\nWhen majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;\nAnd in thy best consideration check\nThis hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,\nThy youngest daughter does not love thee least;\nNor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds\nReverb no hollowness.\n\nLEAR.\nKent, on thy life, no more.\n\nKENT.\nMy life I never held but as a pawn\nTo wage against thine enemies; ne’er fear to lose it,\nThy safety being the motive.\n\nLEAR.\nOut of my sight!\n\nKENT.\nSee better, Lear; and let me still remain\nThe true blank of thine eye.\n\nLEAR.\nNow, by Apollo,—\n\nKENT.\nNow by Apollo, King,\nThou swear’st thy gods in vain.\n\nLEAR.\nO vassal! Miscreant!\n\n[Laying his hand on his sword.]\n\nALBANY and CORNWALL.\nDear sir, forbear!\n\nKENT.\nKill thy physician, and the fee bestow\nUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,\nOr, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,\nI’ll tell thee thou dost evil.\n\nLEAR.\nHear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me!\nSince thou hast sought to make us break our vows,\nWhich we durst never yet, and with strain’d pride\nTo come betwixt our sentences and our power,\nWhich nor our nature, nor our place can bear,\nOur potency made good, take thy reward.\nFive days we do allot thee for provision,\nTo shield thee from disasters of the world;\nAnd on the sixth to turn thy hated back\nUpon our kingdom: if, on the next day following,\nThy banish’d trunk be found in our dominions,\nThe moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\nThis shall not be revok’d.\n\nKENT.\nFare thee well, King: sith thus thou wilt appear,\nFreedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\n[To Cordelia.] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,\nThat justly think’st and hast most rightly said!\n[To Goneril and Regan.] And your large speeches may your deeds approve,\nThat good effects may spring from words of love.\nThus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\nHe’ll shape his old course in a country new.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nFlourish. Re-enter Gloucester, with France, Burgundy and Attendants.\n\nCORDELIA.\nHere’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\n\nLEAR.\nMy Lord of Burgundy,\nWe first address toward you, who with this king\nHath rivall’d for our daughter: what in the least\nWill you require in present dower with her,\nOr cease your quest of love?\n\nBURGUNDY.\nMost royal majesty,\nI crave no more than hath your highness offer’d,\nNor will you tender less.\n\nLEAR.\nRight noble Burgundy,\nWhen she was dear to us, we did hold her so;\nBut now her price is fall’n. Sir, there she stands:\nIf aught within that little-seeming substance,\nOr all of it, with our displeasure piec’d,\nAnd nothing more, may fitly like your grace,\nShe’s there, and she is yours.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nI know no answer.\n\nLEAR.\nWill you, with those infirmities she owes,\nUnfriended, new adopted to our hate,\nDower’d with our curse, and stranger’d with our oath,\nTake her or leave her?\n\nBURGUNDY.\nPardon me, royal sir;\nElection makes not up in such conditions.\n\nLEAR.\nThen leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,\nI tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great king,\nI would not from your love make such a stray\nTo match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\nT’avert your liking a more worthier way\nThan on a wretch whom nature is asham’d\nAlmost t’acknowledge hers.\n\nFRANCE.\nThis is most strange,\nThat she, who even but now was your best object,\nThe argument of your praise, balm of your age,\nThe best, the dearest, should in this trice of time\nCommit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle\nSo many folds of favour. Sure her offence\nMust be of such unnatural degree\nThat monsters it, or your fore-vouch’d affection\nFall into taint; which to believe of her\nMust be a faith that reason without miracle\nShould never plant in me.\n\nCORDELIA.\nI yet beseech your majesty,\nIf for I want that glib and oily art\nTo speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,\nI’ll do’t before I speak,—that you make known\nIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,\nNo unchaste action or dishonour’d step,\nThat hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour;\nBut even for want of that for which I am richer,\nA still soliciting eye, and such a tongue\nAs I am glad I have not, though not to have it\nHath lost me in your liking.\n\nLEAR.\nBetter thou hadst\nNot been born than not to have pleas’d me better.\n\nFRANCE.\nIs it but this?—a tardiness in nature\nWhich often leaves the history unspoke\nThat it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,\nWhat say you to the lady? Love’s not love\nWhen it is mingled with regards that stands\nAloof from the entire point. Will you have her?\nShe is herself a dowry.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nRoyal King,\nGive but that portion which yourself propos’d,\nAnd here I take Cordelia by the hand,\nDuchess of Burgundy.\n\nLEAR.\nNothing: I have sworn; I am firm.\n\nBURGUNDY.\nI am sorry, then, you have so lost a father\nThat you must lose a husband.\n\nCORDELIA.\nPeace be with Burgundy!\nSince that respects of fortunes are his love,\nI shall not be his wife.\n\nFRANCE.\nFairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\nMost choice forsaken; and most lov’d, despis’d!\nThee and thy virtues here I seize upon:\nBe it lawful, I take up what’s cast away.\nGods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st neglect\nMy love should kindle to inflam’d respect.\nThy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\nIs queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:\nNot all the dukes of waterish Burgundy\nCan buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me.\nBid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:\nThou losest here, a better where to find.\n\nLEAR.\nThou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we\nHave no such daughter, nor shall ever see\nThat face of hers again. Therefore be gone\nWithout our grace, our love, our benison.\nCome, noble Burgundy.\n\n[Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester and Attendants.]\n\nFRANCE.\nBid farewell to your sisters.\n\nCORDELIA.\nThe jewels of our father, with wash’d eyes\nCordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;\nAnd like a sister am most loath to call\nYour faults as they are nam’d. Love well our father:\nTo your professed bosoms I commit him:\nBut yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\nI would prefer him to a better place.\nSo farewell to you both.\n\nREGAN.\nPrescribe not us our duties.\n\nGONERIL.\nLet your study\nBe to content your lord, who hath receiv’d you\nAt fortune’s alms. You have obedience scanted,\nAnd well are worth the want that you have wanted.\n\nCORDELIA.\nTime shall unfold what plighted cunning hides:\nWho covers faults, at last shame derides.\nWell may you prosper.\n\nFRANCE.\nCome, my fair Cordelia.\n\n[Exeunt France and Cordelia.]\n\nGONERIL.\nSister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight.\n\nREGAN.\nThat’s most certain, and with you; next month with us.\n\nGONERIL.\nYou see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our sister most; and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.\n\nREGAN.\n’Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.\n\nGONERIL.\nThe best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.\n\nREGAN.\nSuch unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment.\n\nGONERIL.\nThere is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.\n\nREGAN.\nWe shall further think of it.\n\nGONERIL.\nWe must do something, and i’ th’ heat.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester’s Castle\nEnter Edmund with a letter.\n\nEDMUND.\nThou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law\nMy services are bound. Wherefore should I\nStand in the plague of custom, and permit\nThe curiosity of nations to deprive me?\nFor that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\nLag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?\nWhen my dimensions are as well compact,\nMy mind as generous, and my shape as true\nAs honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us\nWith base? With baseness? bastardy? Base, base?\nWho, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\nMore composition and fierce quality\nThan doth within a dull stale tired bed\nGo to the creating a whole tribe of fops\nGot ’tween asleep and wake? Well then,\nLegitimate Edgar, I must have your land:\nOur father’s love is to the bastard Edmund\nAs to the legitimate: fine word: legitimate!\nWell, my legitimate, if this letter speed,\nAnd my invention thrive, Edmund the base\nShall top the legitimate. I grow, I prosper.\nNow, gods, stand up for bastards!\n\nEnter Gloucester.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nKent banish’d thus! and France in choler parted!\nAnd the King gone tonight! Prescrib’d his pow’r!\nConfin’d to exhibition! All this done\nUpon the gad!—Edmund, how now! What news?\n\nEDMUND.\nSo please your lordship, none.\n\n[Putting up the letter.]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhy so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\n\nEDMUND.\nI know no news, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhat paper were you reading?\n\nEDMUND.\nNothing, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNo? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.\n\nEDMUND.\nI beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o’er-read; and for so much as I have perus’d, I find it not fit for your o’er-looking.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nGive me the letter, sir.\n\nEDMUND.\nI shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nLet’s see, let’s see!\n\nEDMUND.\nI hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay, or taste of my virtue.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\n[Reads.] ‘This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother EDGAR.’\nHum! Conspiracy? ‘Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half his revenue.’—My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?\n\nEDMUND.\nIt was not brought me, my lord, there’s the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nYou know the character to be your brother’s?\n\nEDMUND.\nIf the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nIt is his.\n\nEDMUND.\nIt is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHas he never before sounded you in this business?\n\nEDMUND.\nNever, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nO villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I’ll apprehend him. Abominable villain, Where is he?\n\nEDMUND.\nI do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThink you so?\n\nEDMUND.\nIf your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very evening.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHe cannot be such a monster.\n\nEDMUND.\nNor is not, sure.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nTo his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you: frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution.\n\nEDMUND.\nI will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThese late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there’s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence, honesty! ’Tis strange.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEDMUND.\nThis is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.\n\nEnter Edgar.\n\nPat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’Bedlam.—O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.\n\nEDGAR.\nHow now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?\n\nEDMUND.\nI am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses.\n\nEDGAR.\nDo you busy yourself with that?\n\nEDMUND.\nI promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against King and nobles; needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.\n\nEDGAR.\nHow long have you been a sectary astronomical?\n\nEDMUND.\nCome, come! when saw you my father last?\n\nEDGAR.\nThe night gone by.\n\nEDMUND.\nSpake you with him?\n\nEDGAR.\nAy, two hours together.\n\nEDMUND.\nParted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him, by word nor countenance?\n\nEDGAR.\nNone at all.\n\nEDMUND.\nBethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay.\n\nEDGAR.\nSome villain hath done me wrong.\n\nEDMUND.\nThat’s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there’s my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed.\n\nEDGAR.\nArmed, brother?\n\nEDMUND.\nBrother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I have seen and heard. But faintly; nothing like the image and horror of it: pray you, away!\n\nEDGAR.\nShall I hear from you anon?\n\nEDMUND.\nI do serve you in this business.\n\n[Exit Edgar.]\n\nA credulous father! and a brother noble,\nWhose nature is so far from doing harms\nThat he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\nMy practices ride easy! I see the business.\nLet me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;\nAll with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE IV. A Hall in Albany’s Palace\nEnter Kent, disguised.\n\nKENT.\nIf but as well I other accents borrow,\nThat can my speech defuse, my good intent\nMay carry through itself to that full issue\nFor which I rais’d my likeness. Now, banish’d Kent,\nIf thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn’d,\nSo may it come, thy master, whom thou lov’st,\nShall find thee full of labours.\n\nHorns within. Enter King Lear, Knights and Attendants.\n\nLEAR.\nLet me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nHow now! what art thou?\n\nKENT.\nA man, sir.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?\n\nKENT.\nI do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse with him that is wise and says little; to fear judgement; to fight when I cannot choose; and to eat no fish.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat art thou?\n\nKENT.\nA very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.\n\nLEAR.\nIf thou be’st as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?\n\nKENT.\nService.\n\nLEAR.\nWho wouldst thou serve?\n\nKENT.\nYou.\n\nLEAR.\nDost thou know me, fellow?\n\nKENT.\nNo, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat’s that?\n\nKENT.\nAuthority.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat services canst thou do?\n\nKENT.\nI can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.\n\nLEAR.\nHow old art thou?\n\nKENT.\nNot so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to dote on her for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.\n\nLEAR.\nFollow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! Where’s my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nEnter Oswald.\n\nYou, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?\n\nOSWALD.\nSo please you,—\n\n[Exit.]\n\nLEAR.\nWhat says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.\n\n[Exit a Knight.]\n\nWhere’s my fool? Ho, I think the world’s asleep.\n\nRe-enter Knight.\n\nHow now! where’s that mongrel?\n\nKNIGHT.\nHe says, my lord, your daughter is not well.\n\nLEAR.\nWhy came not the slave back to me when I called him?\n\nKNIGHT.\nSir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.\n\nLEAR.\nHe would not?\n\nKNIGHT.\nMy lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgement your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont; there’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also, and your daughter.\n\nLEAR.\nHa! say’st thou so?\n\nKNIGHT.\nI beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.\n\nLEAR.\nThou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness: I will look further into’t. But where’s my fool? I have not seen him this two days.\n\nKNIGHT.\nSince my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away.\n\nLEAR.\nNo more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.\n\n[Exit Attendant.]\n\nGo you, call hither my fool.\n\n[Exit another Attendant.]\n\nRe-enter Oswald.\n\nO, you, sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I, sir?\n\nOSWALD.\nMy lady’s father.\n\nLEAR.\nMy lady’s father! my lord’s knave: you whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!\n\nOSWALD.\nI am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.\n\nLEAR.\nDo you bandy looks with me, you rascal?\n\n[Striking him.]\n\nOSWALD.\nI’ll not be struck, my lord.\n\nKENT.\nNor tripp’d neither, you base football player.\n\n[Tripping up his heels.]\n\nLEAR.\nI thank thee, fellow. Thou serv’st me, and I’ll love thee.\n\nKENT.\nCome, sir, arise, away! I’ll teach you differences: away, away! If you will measure your lubber’s length again, tarry; but away! go to; have you wisdom? So.\n\n[Pushes Oswald out.]\n\nLEAR.\nNow, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there’s earnest of thy service.\n\n[Giving Kent money.]\n\nEnter Fool.\n\nFOOL.\nLet me hire him too; here’s my coxcomb.\n\n[Giving Kent his cap.]\n\nLEAR.\nHow now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?\n\nFOOL.\nSirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.\n\nKENT.\nWhy, fool?\n\nFOOL.\nWhy, for taking one’s part that’s out of favour. Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow has banish’d two on’s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will; if thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb. How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!\n\nLEAR.\nWhy, my boy?\n\nFOOL.\nIf I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs myself. There’s mine; beg another of thy daughters.\n\nLEAR.\nTake heed, sirrah, the whip.\n\nFOOL.\nTruth’s a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out, when the Lady Brach may stand by the fire and stink.\n\nLEAR.\nA pestilent gall to me!\n\nFOOL.\nSirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.\n\nLEAR.\nDo.\n\nFOOL.\nMark it, nuncle:\n    Have more than thou showest,\n    Speak less than thou knowest,\n    Lend less than thou owest,\n    Ride more than thou goest,\n    Learn more than thou trowest,\n    Set less than thou throwest;\n    Leave thy drink and thy whore,\n    And keep in-a-door,\n    And thou shalt have more\n    Than two tens to a score.\n\nKENT.\nThis is nothing, fool.\n\nFOOL.\nThen ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer, you gave me nothing for’t. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?\n\nLEAR.\nWhy, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.\n\nFOOL.\n[to Kent.] Prythee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.\n\nLEAR.\nA bitter fool.\n\nFOOL.\nDost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one?\n\nLEAR.\nNo, lad; teach me.\n\nFOOL.\n   That lord that counsell’d thee\n     To give away thy land,\n   Come place him here by me,\n     Do thou for him stand.\n   The sweet and bitter fool\n     Will presently appear;\n   The one in motley here,\n     The other found out there.\n\nLEAR.\nDost thou call me fool, boy?\n\nFOOL.\nAll thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with.\n\nKENT.\nThis is not altogether fool, my lord.\n\nFOOL.\nNo, faith; lords and great men will not let me; if I had a monopoly out, they would have part on’t and ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool to myself; they’ll be snatching. Nuncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give thee two crowns.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat two crowns shall they be?\n\nFOOL.\nWhy, after I have cut the egg i’ the middle and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i’ the middle and gav’st away both parts, thou bor’st thine ass on thy back o’er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav’st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.\n[Singing.]\n   Fools had ne’er less grace in a year;\n     For wise men are grown foppish,\n   And know not how their wits to wear,\n     Their manners are so apish.\n\nLEAR.\nWhen were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?\n\nFOOL.\nI have used it, nuncle, e’er since thou mad’st thy daughters thy mothers; for when thou gav’st them the rod, and put’st down thine own breeches,\n[Singing.]\n   Then they for sudden joy did weep,\n     And I for sorrow sung,\n   That such a king should play bo-peep,\n     And go the fools among.\nPrythee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie; I would fain learn to lie.\n\nLEAR.\nAn you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.\n\nFOOL.\nI marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they’ll have me whipped for speaking true; thou’lt have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o’thing than a fool: and yet I would not be thee, nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit o’both sides, and left nothing i’ the middle: here comes one o’ the parings.\n\nEnter Goneril.\n\nLEAR.\nHow now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much of late i’ the frown.\n\nFOOL.\nThou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure: I am better than thou art now. I am a fool, thou art nothing. [To Goneril.] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,\n     He that keeps nor crust nor crum,\n     Weary of all, shall want some.\n[Pointing to Lear.] That’s a shealed peascod.\n\nGONERIL.\nNot only, sir, this your all-licens’d fool,\nBut other of your insolent retinue\nDo hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth\nIn rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,\nI had thought, by making this well known unto you,\nTo have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,\nBy what yourself too late have spoke and done,\nThat you protect this course, and put it on\nBy your allowance; which if you should, the fault\nWould not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,\nWhich, in the tender of a wholesome weal,\nMight in their working do you that offence\nWhich else were shame, that then necessity\nWill call discreet proceeding.\n\nFOOL.\nFor you know, nuncle,\n   The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long\n   That it’s had it head bit off by it young.\nSo out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\n\nLEAR.\nAre you our daughter?\n\nGONERIL.\nCome, sir,\nI would you would make use of that good wisdom,\nWhereof I know you are fraught; and put away\nThese dispositions, which of late transform you\nFrom what you rightly are.\n\nFOOL.\nMay not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee!\n\nLEAR.\nDoth any here know me? This is not Lear;\nDoth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?\nEither his notion weakens, his discernings\nAre lethargied. Ha! waking? ’Tis not so!\nWho is it that can tell me who I am?\n\nFOOL.\nLear’s shadow.\n\nLEAR.\nI would learn that; for by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters.\n\nFOOL.\nWhich they will make an obedient father.\n\nLEAR.\nYour name, fair gentlewoman?\n\nGONERIL.\nThis admiration, sir, is much o’ the favour\nOf other your new pranks. I do beseech you\nTo understand my purposes aright:\nAs you are old and reverend, you should be wise.\nHere do you keep a hundred knights and squires;\nMen so disorder’d, so debosh’d and bold\nThat this our court, infected with their manners,\nShows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust\nMakes it more like a tavern or a brothel\nThan a grac’d palace. The shame itself doth speak\nFor instant remedy. Be, then, desir’d\nBy her that else will take the thing she begs\nA little to disquantity your train;\nAnd the remainder that shall still depend,\nTo be such men as may besort your age,\nWhich know themselves, and you.\n\nLEAR.\nDarkness and devils!\nSaddle my horses; call my train together.\nDegenerate bastard! I’ll not trouble thee:\nYet have I left a daughter.\n\nGONERIL.\nYou strike my people; and your disorder’d rabble\nMake servants of their betters.\n\nEnter Albany.\n\nLEAR.\nWoe that too late repents!—\n[To Albany.] O, sir, are you come?\nIs it your will? Speak, sir.—Prepare my horses.\nIngratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,\nMore hideous when thou show’st thee in a child\nThan the sea-monster!\n\nALBANY.\nPray, sir, be patient.\n\nLEAR.\n[to Goneril.] Detested kite, thou liest.\nMy train are men of choice and rarest parts,\nThat all particulars of duty know;\nAnd in the most exact regard support\nThe worships of their name. O most small fault,\nHow ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!\nWhich, like an engine, wrench’d my frame of nature\nFrom the fix’d place; drew from my heart all love,\nAnd added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!\n[Striking his head.] Beat at this gate that let thy folly in\nAnd thy dear judgement out! Go, go, my people.\n\nALBANY.\nMy lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant\nOf what hath moved you.\n\nLEAR.\nIt may be so, my lord.\nHear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!\nSuspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend\nTo make this creature fruitful!\nInto her womb convey sterility!\nDry up in her the organs of increase;\nAnd from her derogate body never spring\nA babe to honour her! If she must teem,\nCreate her child of spleen, that it may live\nAnd be a thwart disnatur’d torment to her!\nLet it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;\nWith cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;\nTurn all her mother’s pains and benefits\nTo laughter and contempt; that she may feel\nHow sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is\nTo have a thankless child! Away, away!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nALBANY.\nNow, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?\n\nGONERIL.\nNever afflict yourself to know more of it;\nBut let his disposition have that scope\nThat dotage gives it.\n\nRe-enter Lear.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat, fifty of my followers at a clap?\nWithin a fortnight?\n\nALBANY.\nWhat’s the matter, sir?\n\nLEAR.\nI’ll tell thee. [To Goneril.] Life and death! I am asham’d\nThat thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;\nThat these hot tears, which break from me perforce,\nShould make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!\nTh’untented woundings of a father’s curse\nPierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,\nBeweep this cause again, I’ll pluck ye out,\nAnd cast you with the waters that you lose\nTo temper clay. Ha! Let it be so.\nI have another daughter,\nWho, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:\nWhen she shall hear this of thee, with her nails\nShe’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find\nThat I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think\nI have cast off for ever.\n\n[Exeunt Lear, Kent and Attendants.]\n\nGONERIL.\nDo you mark that?\n\nALBANY.\nI cannot be so partial, Goneril,\nTo the great love I bear you,—\n\nGONERIL.\nPray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!\n[To the Fool.] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.\n\nFOOL.\nNuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool with thee.\n   A fox when one has caught her,\n   And such a daughter,\n   Should sure to the slaughter,\n   If my cap would buy a halter;\n   So the fool follows after.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nGONERIL.\nThis man hath had good counsel.—A hundred knights!\n’Tis politic and safe to let him keep\nAt point a hundred knights: yes, that on every dream,\nEach buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,\nHe may enguard his dotage with their powers,\nAnd hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!\n\nALBANY.\nWell, you may fear too far.\n\nGONERIL.\nSafer than trust too far:\nLet me still take away the harms I fear,\nNot fear still to be taken: I know his heart.\nWhat he hath utter’d I have writ my sister:\nIf she sustain him and his hundred knights,\nWhen I have show’d th’unfitness,—\n\nRe-enter Oswald.\n\nHow now, Oswald!\nWhat, have you writ that letter to my sister?\n\nOSWALD.\nAy, madam.\n\nGONERIL.\nTake you some company, and away to horse:\nInform her full of my particular fear;\nAnd thereto add such reasons of your own\nAs may compact it more. Get you gone;\nAnd hasten your return.\n\n[Exit Oswald.]\n\nNo, no, my lord!\nThis milky gentleness and course of yours,\nThough I condemn not, yet, under pardon,\nYou are much more attask’d for want of wisdom\nThan prais’d for harmful mildness.\n\nALBANY.\nHow far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:\nStriving to better, oft we mar what’s well.\n\nGONERIL.\nNay then,—\n\nALBANY.\nWell, well; the event.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

I have been with your father, and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be here with him this night.\n\nEDMUND.\nHow comes that?\n\nCURAN.\nNay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad; I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?\n\nEDMUND.\nNot I: pray you, what are they?\n\nCURAN.\nHave you heard of no likely wars toward, ’twixt the two dukes of Cornwall and Albany?\n\nEDMUND.\nNot a word.\n\nCURAN.\nYou may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEDMUND.\nThe Duke be here tonight? The better! best!\nThis weaves itself perforce into my business.\nMy father hath set guard to take my brother;\nAnd I have one thing, of a queasy question,\nWhich I must act. Briefness and fortune work!\nBrother, a word, descend, brother, I say!\n\nEnter Edgar.\n\nMy father watches: O sir, fly this place;\nIntelligence is given where you are hid;\nYou have now the good advantage of the night.\nHave you not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall?\nHe’s coming hither; now, i’ the night, i’ the haste,\nAnd Regan with him: have you nothing said\nUpon his party ’gainst the Duke of Albany?\nAdvise yourself.\n\nEDGAR.\nI am sure on’t, not a word.\n\nEDMUND.\nI hear my father coming:—pardon me;\nIn cunning I must draw my sword upon you:\nDraw: seem to defend yourself: now quit you well.\nYield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!\nFly, brother. Torches, torches!—So farewell.\n\n[Exit Edgar.]\n\nSome blood drawn on me would beget opinion\nOf my more fierce endeavour: [Wounds his arm.]\nI have seen drunkards\nDo more than this in sport. Father, father!\nStop, stop! No help?\n\nEnter Gloucester and Servants with torches.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNow, Edmund, where’s the villain?\n\nEDMUND.\nHere stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,\nMumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon\nTo stand auspicious mistress.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nBut where is he?\n\nEDMUND.\nLook, sir, I bleed.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhere is the villain, Edmund?\n\nEDMUND.\nFled this way, sir. When by no means he could,—\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nPursue him, ho! Go after.\n\n[Exeunt Servants.]\n\n—By no means what?\n\nEDMUND.\nPersuade me to the murder of your lordship;\nBut that I told him the revenging gods\n’Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;\nSpoke with how manifold and strong a bond\nThe child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,\nSeeing how loathly opposite I stood\nTo his unnatural purpose, in fell motion\nWith his prepared sword, he charges home\nMy unprovided body, latch’d mine arm;\nBut when he saw my best alarum’d spirits,\nBold in the quarrel’s right, rous’d to th’encounter,\nOr whether gasted by the noise I made,\nFull suddenly he fled.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nLet him fly far;\nNot in this land shall he remain uncaught;\nAnd found—dispatch’d. The noble Duke my master,\nMy worthy arch and patron, comes tonight:\nBy his authority I will proclaim it,\nThat he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,\nBringing the murderous coward to the stake;\nHe that conceals him, death.\n\nEDMUND.\nWhen I dissuaded him from his intent,\nAnd found him pight to do it, with curst speech\nI threaten’d to discover him: he replied,\n‘Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,\nIf I would stand against thee, would the reposal\nOf any trust, virtue, or worth in thee\nMake thy words faith’d? No: what I should deny\nAs this I would; ay, though thou didst produce\nMy very character, I’d turn it all\nTo thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:\nAnd thou must make a dullard of the world,\nIf they not thought the profits of my death\nWere very pregnant and potential spurs\nTo make thee seek it.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nO strange and fast’ned villain!\nWould he deny his letter, said he?

I know not why he comes.\nAll ports I’ll bar; the villain shall not scape;\nThe Duke must grant me that: besides, his picture\nI will send far and near, that all the kingdom\nMay have due note of him; and of my land,\nLoyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means\nTo make thee capable.\n\nEnter Cornwall, Regan and Attendants.\n\nCORNWALL.\nHow now, my noble friend! since I came hither,\nWhich I can call but now, I have heard strange news.\n\nREGAN.\nIf it be true, all vengeance comes too short\nWhich can pursue th’offender.

For you, Edmund,\nWhose virtue and obedience doth this instant\nSo much commend itself, you shall be ours:\nNatures of such deep trust we shall much need;\nYou we first seize on.\n\nEDMUND.\nI shall serve you, sir, truly, however else.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nFor him I thank your grace.\n\nCORNWALL.\nYou know not why we came to visit you?\n\nREGAN.\nThus out of season, threading dark-ey’d night:\nOccasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,\nWherein we must have use of your advice.\nOur father he hath writ, so hath our sister,\nOf differences, which I best thought it fit\nTo answer from our home; the several messengers\nFrom hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,\nLay comforts to your bosom; and bestow\nYour needful counsel to our business,\nWhich craves the instant use.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI serve you, madam:\nYour graces are right welcome.\n\n[Exeunt.

I know thee not.\n\nKENT.\nFellow, I know thee.\n\nOSWALD.\nWhat dost thou know me for?\n\nKENT.\nA knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, super-serviceable, finical rogue; one trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition.\n\nOSWALD.\nWhy, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that’s neither known of thee nor knows thee?\n\nKENT.\nWhat a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the King? Draw, you rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon shines; I’ll make a sop o’ the moonshine of you: draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw!\n\n[Drawing his sword.]\n\nOSWALD.\nAway! I have nothing to do with thee.\n\nKENT.\nDraw, you rascal: you come with letters against the King; and take vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks:—draw, you rascal; come your ways!\n\nOSWALD.\nHelp, ho! murder! help!\n\nKENT.\nStrike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat slave, strike!\n\n[Beating him.]\n\nOSWALD.\nHelp, ho! murder! murder!\n\nEnter Edmund, Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester and Servants.\n\nEDMUND.\nHow now! What’s the matter? Part!\n\nKENT.\nWith you, goodman boy, if you please: come, I’ll flesh ye; come on, young master.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWeapons! arms! What’s the matter here?\n\nCORNWALL.\nKeep peace, upon your lives, he dies that strikes again. What is the matter?\n\nREGAN.\nThe messengers from our sister and the King.\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhat is your difference? Speak.\n\nOSWALD.\nI am scarce in breath, my lord.\n\nKENT.\nNo marvel, you have so bestirr’d your valour. You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.\n\nCORNWALL.\nThou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?\n\nKENT.\nAy, a tailor, sir: a stonecutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though he had been but two years at the trade.\n\nCORNWALL.\nSpeak yet, how grew your quarrel?\n\nOSWALD.\nThis ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of his grey beard,—\n\nKENT.\nThou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you’ll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. Spare my grey beard, you wagtail?\n\nCORNWALL.\nPeace, sirrah!\nYou beastly knave, know you no reverence?\n\nKENT.\nYes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhy art thou angry?\n\nKENT.\nThat such a slave as this should wear a sword,\nWho wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,\nLike rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain\nWhich are too intrince t’unloose; smooth every passion\nThat in the natures of their lords rebel;\nBring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;\nRenege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks\nWith every gale and vary of their masters,\nKnowing naught, like dogs, but following.\nA plague upon your epileptic visage!\nSmile you my speeches, as I were a fool?\nGoose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,\nI’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhat, art thou mad, old fellow?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHow fell you out? Say that.\n\nKENT.\nNo contraries hold more antipathy\nThan I and such a knave.\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhy dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?\n\nKENT.\nHis countenance likes me not.\n\nCORNWALL.\nNo more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.\n\nKENT.\nSir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:\nI have seen better faces in my time\nThan stands on any shoulder that I see\nBefore me at this instant.\n\nCORNWALL.\nThis is some fellow\nWho, having been prais’d for bluntness, doth affect\nA saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\nQuite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,\nAn honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!\nAn they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain.\nThese kind of knaves I know which in this plainness\nHarbour more craft and more corrupter ends\nThan twenty silly-ducking observants\nThat stretch their duties nicely.\n\nKENT.\nSir, in good faith, in sincere verity,\nUnder th’allowance of your great aspect,\nWhose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\nOn flickering Phoebus’ front,—\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhat mean’st by this?\n\nKENT.\nTo go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which, for my part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to’t.\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhat was the offence you gave him?\n\nOSWALD.\nI never gave him any:\nIt pleas’d the King his master very late\nTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\nWhen he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,\nTripp’d me behind; being down, insulted, rail’d\nAnd put upon him such a deal of man,\nThat worthied him, got praises of the King\nFor him attempting who was self-subdu’d;\nAnd, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\nDrew on me here again.\n\nKENT.\nNone of these rogues and cowards\nBut Ajax is their fool.\n\nCORNWALL.\nFetch forth the stocks!\nYou stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,\nWe’ll teach you.\n\nKENT.\nSir, I am too old to learn:\nCall not your stocks for me: I serve the King;\nOn whose employment I was sent to you:\nYou shall do small respect, show too bold malice\nAgainst the grace and person of my master,\nStocking his messenger.\n\nCORNWALL.\nFetch forth the stocks!\nAs I have life and honour, there shall he sit till noon.\n\nREGAN.\nTill noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too!\n\nKENT.\nWhy, madam, if I were your father’s dog,\nYou should not use me so.\n\nREGAN.\nSir, being his knave, I will.\n\n[Stocks brought out.]\n\nCORNWALL.\nThis is a fellow of the selfsame colour\nOur sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nLet me beseech your grace not to do so:\nHis fault is much, and the good King his master\nWill check him for’t: your purpos’d low correction\nIs such as basest and contemned’st wretches\nFor pilferings and most common trespasses,\nAre punish’d with. The King must take it ill\nThat he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\nShould have him thus restrained.\n\nCORNWALL.\nI’ll answer that.\n\nREGAN.\nMy sister may receive it much more worse,\nTo have her gentleman abus’d, assaulted,\nFor following her affairs. Put in his legs.\n\n[Kent is put in the stocks.]\n\nCORNWALL.\nCome, my good lord, away.\n\n[Exeunt all but Gloucester and Kent.]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI am sorry for thee, friend; ’tis the Duke’s pleasure,\nWhose disposition, all the world well knows,\nWill not be rubb’d nor stopp’d; I’ll entreat for thee.\n\nKENT.\nPray do not, sir: I have watch’d, and travell’d hard;\nSome time I shall sleep out, the rest I’ll whistle.\nA good man’s fortune may grow out at heels:\nGive you good morrow!\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThe Duke’s to blame in this: ’twill be ill taken.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nKENT.\nGood King, that must approve the common saw,\nThou out of heaven’s benediction com’st\nTo the warm sun.\nApproach, thou beacon to this under globe,\nThat by thy comfortable beams I may\nPeruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles\nBut misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,\nWho hath most fortunately been inform’d\nOf my obscured course. And shall find time\nFrom this enormous state, seeking to give\nLosses their remedies. All weary and o’erwatch’d,\nTake vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold\nThis shameful lodging.\nFortune, good night: smile once more, turn thy wheel!\n\n[He sleeps.]",

Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?\n\nKENT.\nNo, my lord.\n\nFOOL.\nHa, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the heads; dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs: when a man is overlusty at legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat’s he that hath so much thy place mistook\nTo set thee here?\n\nKENT.\nIt is both he and she,\nYour son and daughter.\n\nLEAR.\nNo.\n\nKENT.\nYes.\n\nLEAR.\nNo, I say.\n\nKENT.\nI say, yea.\n\nLEAR.\nNo, no; they would not.\n\nKENT.\nYes, they have.\n\nLEAR.\nBy Jupiter, I swear no.\n\nKENT.\nBy Juno, I swear ay.\n\nLEAR.\nThey durst not do’t.\nThey could not, would not do’t; ’tis worse than murder,\nTo do upon respect such violent outrage:\nResolve me, with all modest haste, which way\nThou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,\nComing from us.\n\nKENT.\nMy lord, when at their home\nI did commend your highness’ letters to them,\nEre I was risen from the place that show’d\nMy duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,\nStew’d in his haste, half breathless, panting forth\nFrom Goneril his mistress salutations;\nDeliver’d letters, spite of intermission,\nWhich presently they read; on those contents,\nThey summon’d up their meiny, straight took horse;\nCommanded me to follow and attend\nThe leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:\nAnd meeting here the other messenger,\nWhose welcome I perceiv’d had poison’d mine,\nBeing the very fellow which of late\nDisplay’d so saucily against your highness,\nHaving more man than wit about me, drew;\nHe rais’d the house with loud and coward cries.\nYour son and daughter found this trespass worth\nThe shame which here it suffers.\n\nFOOL.\nWinter’s not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.\n  Fathers that wear rags\n    Do make their children blind,\n  But fathers that bear bags\n    Shall see their children kind.\n  Fortune, that arrant whore,\n  Ne’er turns the key to th’ poor.\nBut for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.\n\nLEAR.\nO, how this mother swells up toward my heart!\nHysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,\nThy element’s below!

All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.\n   That sir which serves and seeks for gain,\n     And follows but for form,\n   Will pack when it begins to rain,\n     And leave thee in the storm.\n   But I will tarry; the fool will stay,\n     And let the wise man fly:\n   The knave turns fool that runs away;\n     The fool no knave perdy.\n\nKENT.\nWhere learn’d you this, fool?\n\nFOOL.\nNot i’ the stocks, fool.\n\nEnter Lear and Gloucester.\n\nLEAR.\nDeny to speak with me?

Mere fetches;\nThe images of revolt and flying off.\nFetch me a better answer.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nMy dear lord,\nYou know the fiery quality of the Duke;\nHow unremovable and fix’d he is\nIn his own course.\n\nLEAR.\nVengeance! plague! death! confusion!\nFiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,\nI’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWell, my good lord, I have inform’d them so.\n\nLEAR.\nInform’d them! Dost thou understand me, man?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nLEAR.\nThe King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father\nWould with his daughter speak, commands, tends, service,\nAre they inform’d of this? My breath and blood!\nFiery? The fiery Duke, tell the hot Duke that—\nNo, but not yet: maybe he is not well:\nInfirmity doth still neglect all office\nWhereto our health is bound: we are not ourselves\nWhen nature, being oppress’d, commands the mind\nTo suffer with the body: I’ll forbear;\nAnd am fallen out with my more headier will,\nTo take the indispos’d and sickly fit\nFor the sound man. [Looking on Kent.]\nDeath on my state! Wherefore\nShould he sit here? This act persuades me\nThat this remotion of the Duke and her\nIs practice only. Give me my servant forth.\nGo tell the Duke and’s wife I’d speak with them,\nNow, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,\nOr at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum\nTill it cry sleep to death.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI would have all well betwixt you.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nLEAR.\nO me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!\n\nFOOL.\nCry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put ’em i’ the paste alive; she knapped ’em o’ the coxcombs with a stick and cried ‘Down, wantons, down!’ ’Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay.\n\nEnter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester and Servants.\n\nLEAR.\nGood morrow to you both.\n\nCORNWALL.\nHail to your grace!\n\n[Kent here set at liberty.]\n\nREGAN.\nI am glad to see your highness.\n\nLEAR.\nRegan, I think you are; I know what reason\nI have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,\nI would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb,\nSepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?\nSome other time for that.—Beloved Regan,\nThy sister’s naught: O Regan, she hath tied\nSharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here.\n\n[Points to his heart.]\n\nI can scarce speak to thee; thou’lt not believe\nWith how deprav’d a quality—O Regan!\n\nREGAN.\nI pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope\nYou less know how to value her desert\nThan she to scant her duty.\n\nLEAR.\nSay, how is that?\n\nREGAN.\nI cannot think my sister in the least\nWould fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\nShe have restrain’d the riots of your followers,\n’Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\nAs clears her from all blame.\n\nLEAR.\nMy curses on her.\n\nREGAN.\nO, sir, you are old;\nNature in you stands on the very verge\nOf her confine: you should be rul’d and led\nBy some discretion, that discerns your state\nBetter than you yourself. Therefore I pray you,\nThat to our sister you do make return;\nSay you have wrong’d her, sir.\n\nLEAR.\nAsk her forgiveness?\nDo you but mark how this becomes the house?\n‘Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;\n[Kneeling.]\nAge is unnecessary: on my knees I beg\nThat you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’\n\nREGAN.\nGood sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks:\nReturn you to my sister.\n\nLEAR.\n[Rising.] Never, Regan:\nShe hath abated me of half my train;\nLook’d black upon me; struck me with her tongue,\nMost serpent-like, upon the very heart.\nAll the stor’d vengeances of heaven fall\nOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,\nYou taking airs, with lameness!\n\nCORNWALL.\nFie, sir, fie!\n\nLEAR.\nYou nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames\nInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,\nYou fen-suck’d fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,\nTo fall and blast her pride!\n\nREGAN.\nO the blest gods!\nSo will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.\n\nLEAR.\nNo, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.\nThy tender-hefted nature shall not give\nThee o’er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine\nDo comfort, and not burn. ’Tis not in thee\nTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,\nTo bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,\nAnd, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt\nAgainst my coming in. Thou better know’st\nThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,\nEffects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;\nThy half o’ the kingdom hast thou not forgot,\nWherein I thee endow’d.\n\nREGAN.\nGood sir, to the purpose.\n\nLEAR.\nWho put my man i’ the stocks?\n\n[Tucket within.]\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhat trumpet’s that?\n\nREGAN.\nI know’t, my sister’s: this approves her letter,\nThat she would soon be here.\n\nEnter Oswald.\n\nIs your lady come?\n\nLEAR.\nThis is a slave, whose easy borrowed pride\nDwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.\nOut, varlet, from my sight!\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhat means your grace?\n\nLEAR.\nWho stock’d my servant? Regan, I have good hope\nThou didst not know on’t. Who comes here? O heavens!\n\nEnter Goneril.\n\nIf you do love old men, if your sweet sway\nAllow obedience, if yourselves are old,\nMake it your cause; send down, and take my part!\n[To Goneril.] Art not asham’d to look upon this beard?\nO Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?\n\nGONERIL.\nWhy not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?\nAll’s not offence that indiscretion finds\nAnd dotage terms so.\n\nLEAR.\nO sides, you are too tough!\nWill you yet hold? How came my man i’ the stocks?\n\nCORNWALL.\nI set him there, sir: but his own disorders\nDeserv’d much less advancement.\n\nLEAR.\nYou? Did you?\n\nREGAN.\nI pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\nIf, till the expiration of your month,\nYou will return and sojourn with my sister,\nDismissing half your train, come then to me:\nI am now from home, and out of that provision\nWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.\n\nLEAR.\nReturn to her, and fifty men dismiss’d?\nNo, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\nTo wage against the enmity o’ the air;\nTo be a comrade with the wolf and owl,\nNecessity’s sharp pinch! Return with her?\nWhy, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\nOur youngest born, I could as well be brought\nTo knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg\nTo keep base life afoot. Return with her?\nPersuade me rather to be slave and sumpter\nTo this detested groom.\n\n[Pointing to Oswald.]\n\nGONERIL.\nAt your choice, sir.\n\nLEAR.\nI prythee, daughter, do not make me mad:\nI will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:\nWe’ll no more meet, no more see one another.\nBut yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;\nOr rather a disease that’s in my flesh,\nWhich I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,\nA plague sore, or embossed carbuncle\nIn my corrupted blood. But I’ll not chide thee;\nLet shame come when it will, I do not call it:\nI do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,\nNor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:\nMend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:\nI can be patient; I can stay with Regan,\nI and my hundred knights.\n\nREGAN.\nNot altogether so,\nI look’d not for you yet, nor am provided\nFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\nFor those that mingle reason with your passion\nMust be content to think you old, and so—\nBut she knows what she does.\n\nLEAR.\nIs this well spoken?\n\nREGAN.\nI dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?\nIs it not well? What should you need of more?\nYea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\nSpeak ’gainst so great a number? How in one house\nShould many people, under two commands,\nHold amity? ’Tis hard; almost impossible.\n\nGONERIL.\nWhy might not you, my lord, receive attendance\nFrom those that she calls servants, or from mine?\n\nREGAN.\nWhy not, my lord? If then they chanc’d to slack ye,\nWe could control them. If you will come to me,—\nFor now I spy a danger,—I entreat you\nTo bring but five-and-twenty: to no more\nWill I give place or notice.\n\nLEAR.\nI gave you all,—\n\nREGAN.\nAnd in good time you gave it.\n\nLEAR.\nMade you my guardians, my depositaries;\nBut kept a reservation to be followed\nWith such a number. What, must I come to you\nWith five-and-twenty, Regan, said you so?\n\nREGAN.\nAnd speak’t again my lord; no more with me.\n\nLEAR.\nThose wicked creatures yet do look well-favour’d\nWhen others are more wicked; not being the worst\nStands in some rank of praise.\n[To Goneril.] I’ll go with thee:\nThy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,\nAnd thou art twice her love.\n\nGONERIL.\nHear me, my lord:\nWhat need you five-and-twenty? Ten? Or five?\nTo follow in a house where twice so many\nHave a command to tend you?\n\nREGAN.\nWhat need one?\n\nLEAR.\nO, reason not the need: our basest beggars\nAre in the poorest thing superfluous:\nAllow not nature more than nature needs,\nMan’s life is cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady;\nIf only to go warm were gorgeous,\nWhy, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st\nWhich scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,—\nYou heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!\nYou see me here, you gods, a poor old man,\nAs full of grief as age; wretched in both!\nIf it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts\nAgainst their father, fool me not so much\nTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,\nAnd let not women’s weapons, water-drops,\nStain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,\nI will have such revenges on you both\nThat all the world shall,—I will do such things,—\nWhat they are yet, I know not; but they shall be\nThe terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep;\nNo, I’ll not weep:— [Storm and tempest.]\nI have full cause of weeping; but this heart\nShall break into a hundred thousand flaws\nOr ere I’ll weep.—O fool, I shall go mad!\n\n[Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent and Fool.]\n\nCORNWALL.\nLet us withdraw; ’twill be a storm.\n\nREGAN.\nThis house is little: the old man and his people\nCannot be well bestow’d.\n\nGONERIL.\n’Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest\nAnd must needs taste his folly.\n\nREGAN.\nFor his particular, I’ll receive him gladly,\nBut not one follower.\n\nGONERIL.\nSo am I purpos’d.\nWhere is my lord of Gloucester?\n\nEnter Gloucester.\n\nCORNWALL.\nFollowed the old man forth, he is return’d.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThe King is in high rage.\n\nCORNWALL.\nWhither is he going?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHe calls to horse; but will I know not whither.\n\nCORNWALL.\n’Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.\n\nGONERIL.\nMy lord, entreat him by no means to stay.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAlack, the night comes on, and the high winds\nDo sorely ruffle; for many miles about\nThere’s scarce a bush.\n\nREGAN.\nO, sir, to wilful men\nThe injuries that they themselves procure\nMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.\nHe is attended with a desperate train,\nAnd what they may incense him to, being apt\nTo have his ear abus’d, wisdom bids fear.\n\nCORNWALL.\nShut up your doors, my lord; ’tis a wild night.\nMy Regan counsels well: come out o’ the storm.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

There is division,\nAlthough as yet the face of it be cover’d\nWith mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall;\nWho have, as who have not, that their great stars\nThrone’d and set high; servants, who seem no less,\nWhich are to France the spies and speculations\nIntelligent of our state. What hath been seen,\nEither in snuffs and packings of the Dukes;\nOr the hard rein which both of them have borne\nAgainst the old kind King; or something deeper,\nWhereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;—\nBut, true it is, from France there comes a power\nInto this scatter’d kingdom; who already,\nWise in our negligence, have secret feet\nIn some of our best ports, and are at point\nTo show their open banner.—Now to you:\nIf on my credit you dare build so far\nTo make your speed to Dover, you shall find\nSome that will thank you making just report\nOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrow\nThe King hath cause to plain.\nI am a gentleman of blood and breeding;\nAnd from some knowledge and assurance\nOffer this office to you.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nI will talk further with you.\n\nKENT.\nNo, do not.\nFor confirmation that I am much more\nThan my out-wall, open this purse, and take\nWhat it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,\nAs fear not but you shall, show her this ring;\nAnd she will tell you who your fellow is\nThat yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!\nI will go seek the King.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nGive me your hand: have you no more to say?\n\nKENT.\nFew words, but, to effect, more than all yet:\nThat, when we have found the King, in which your pain\nThat way, I’ll this; he that first lights on him\nHolla the other.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lender’s book, and defy the foul fiend.

Ah, that good Kent!\nHe said it would be thus, poor banish’d man!\nThou sayest the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee, friend,\nI am almost mad myself. I had a son,\nNow outlaw’d from my blood; he sought my life\nBut lately, very late: I lov’d him, friend,\nNo father his son dearer: true to tell thee,\n\n[Storm continues.]\n\nThe grief hath craz’d my wits.

Now, where’s your master?\n\nOSWALD.\nMadam, within; but never man so chang’d.\nI told him of the army that was landed;\nHe smil’d at it: I told him you were coming;\nHis answer was, ‘The worse.’ Of Gloucester’s treachery\nAnd of the loyal service of his son\nWhen I inform’d him, then he call’d me sot,\nAnd told me I had turn’d the wrong side out.\nWhat most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;\nWhat like, offensive.\n\nGONERIL.\n[To Edmund.] Then shall you go no further.\nIt is the cowish terror of his spirit,\nThat dares not undertake. He’ll not feel wrongs\nWhich tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way\nMay prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;\nHasten his musters and conduct his powers.\nI must change names at home, and give the distaff\nInto my husband’s hands. This trusty servant\nShall pass between us.

If Edgar live, O, bless him!\nNow, fellow, fare thee well.\n\nEDGAR.\nGone, sir, farewell.\n\n[Gloucester leaps, and falls along]\n\nAnd yet I know not how conceit may rob\nThe treasury of life when life itself\nYields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,\nBy this had thought been past. Alive or dead?\nHo you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? speak!\nThus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.\nWhat are you, sir?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAway, and let me die.\n\nEDGAR.\nHadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\nThou’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;\nHast heavy substance; bleed’st not; speak’st; art sound.\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.\nThy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nBut have I fall’n, or no?\n\nEDGAR.\nFrom the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\nLook up a-height, the shrill-gorg’d lark so far\nCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAlack, I have no eyes.\nIs wretchedness depriv’d that benefit\nTo end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\n\nEDGAR.\nGive me your arm.\nUp, so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nToo well, too well.\n\nEDGAR.\nThis is above all strangeness.\nUpon the crown o’ the cliff what thing was that\nWhich parted from you?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nA poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEDGAR.\nAs I stood here below, methought his eyes\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\nHorns whelk’d and waved like the enraged sea.\nIt was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them honours\nOf men’s impossibilities, have preserv’d thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI do remember now: henceforth I’ll bear\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\n‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of,\nI took it for a man; often ’twould say,\n‘The fiend, the fiend’; he led me to that place.\n\nEDGAR.\nBear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?\n\nEnter Lear, fantastically dressed up with flowers.\n\nThe safer sense will ne’er accommodate\nHis master thus.\n\nLEAR.\nNo, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the King himself.\n\nEDGAR.\nO thou side-piercing sight!\n\nLEAR.\nNature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i’ the clout, i’ the clout. Hewgh! Give the word.\n\nEDGAR.\nSweet marjoram.\n\nLEAR.\nPass.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI know that voice.\n\nLEAR.\nHa! Goneril with a white beard! They flattered me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything I said ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was everything; ’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThe trick of that voice I do well remember:\nIs’t not the King?\n\nLEAR.\nAy, every inch a king.\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\nI pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?\nAdultery? Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:\nThe wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly\nDoes lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive;\nFor Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father\nThan my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.\nTo’t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\nBehold yond simp’ring dame,\nWhose face between her forks presages snow;\nThat minces virtue, and does shake the head\nTo hear of pleasure’s name.\nThe fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the fiend’s; there’s hell, there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nO, let me kiss that hand!\n\nLEAR.\nLet me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nO ruin’d piece of nature, this great world\nShall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?\n\nLEAR.\nI remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?\nNo, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love.\nRead thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWere all the letters suns, I could not see one.\n\nEDGAR.\nI would not take this from report,\nIt is, and my heart breaks at it.\n\nLEAR.\nRead.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhat, with the case of eyes?\n\nLEAR.\nO, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how this world goes.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nI see it feelingly.\n\nLEAR.\nWhat, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAy, sir.\n\nLEAR.\nAnd the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office.\nThou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\nWhy dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;\nThou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\nFor which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\nThrough tatter’d clothes great vices do appear;\nRobes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\nAnd the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;\nArm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it.\nNone does offend, none, I say none; I’ll able ’em;\nTake that of me, my friend, who have the power\nTo seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,\nAnd like a scurvy politician, seem\nTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:\nPull off my boots: harder, harder, so.\n\nEDGAR.\nO, matter and impertinency mix’d!\nReason in madness!\n\nLEAR.\nIf thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\nI know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester.\nThou must be patient; we came crying hither:\nThou know’st the first time that we smell the air\nWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nAlack, alack the day!\n\nLEAR.\nWhen we are born, we cry that we are come\nTo this great stage of fools. This a good block:\nIt were a delicate stratagem to shoe\nA troop of horse with felt. I’ll put’t in proof\nAnd when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,\nThen kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\n\nEnter a Gentleman with Attendants.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nO, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,\nYour most dear daughter—\n\nLEAR.\nNo rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\nThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\nYou shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;\nI am cut to the brains.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nYou shall have anything.\n\nLEAR.\nNo seconds? All myself?\nWhy, this would make a man a man of salt,\nTo use his eyes for garden water-pots,\nAy, and for laying autumn’s dust.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nGood sir.\n\nLEAR.\nI will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.\nWhat! I will be jovial. Come, come,\nI am a king, my masters, know you that.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nYou are a royal one, and we obey you.\n\nLEAR.\nThen there’s life in’t. Come, and you get it,\nYou shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!\n\n[Exit running. Attendants follow.]\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nA sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\nPast speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter\nWho redeems nature from the general curse\nWhich twain have brought her to.\n\nEDGAR.\nHail, gentle sir.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nSir, speed you. What’s your will?\n\nEDGAR.\nDo you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nMost sure and vulgar.\nEveryone hears that, which can distinguish sound.\n\nEDGAR.\nBut, by your favour,\nHow near’s the other army?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nNear and on speedy foot; the main descry\nStands on the hourly thought.\n\nEDGAR.\nI thank you sir, that’s all.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nThough that the queen on special cause is here,\nHer army is mov’d on.\n\nEDGAR.\nI thank you, sir.\n\n[Exit Gentleman.]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nYou ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;\nLet not my worser spirit tempt me again\nTo die before you please.\n\nEDGAR.\nWell pray you, father.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNow, good sir, what are you?\n\nEDGAR.\nA most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows;\nWho, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\nAm pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,\nI’ll lead you to some biding.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nHearty thanks:\nThe bounty and the benison of heaven\nTo boot, and boot.\n\nEnter Oswald.\n\nOSWALD.\nA proclaim’d prize! Most happy!\nThat eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh\nTo raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,\nBriefly thyself remember. The sword is out\nThat must destroy thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nNow let thy friendly hand\nPut strength enough to’t.\n\n[Edgar interposes.]\n\nOSWALD.\nWherefore, bold peasant,\nDar’st thou support a publish’d traitor? Hence;\nLest that th’infection of his fortune take\nLike hold on thee. Let go his arm.\n\nEDGAR.\nChill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion.\n\nOSWALD.\nLet go, slave, or thou diest!\n\nEDGAR.\nGood gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volke pass. An chud ha’ bin zwaggered out of my life, ’twould not ha’ bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’old man; keep out, che vor ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder: chill be plain with you.\n\nOSWALD.\nOut, dunghill!\n\nEDGAR.\nChill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins.\n\n[They fight, and Edgar knocks him down.]\n\nOSWALD.\nSlave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.\nIf ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;\nAnd give the letters which thou find’st about me\nTo Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out\nUpon the British party. O, untimely death!\n\n[Dies.]\n\nEDGAR.\nI know thee well. A serviceable villain,\nAs duteous to the vices of thy mistress\nAs badness would desire.\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nWhat, is he dead?\n\nEDGAR.\nSit you down, father; rest you.\nLet’s see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of\nMay be my friends. He’s dead; I am only sorry\nHe had no other deathsman. Let us see:\nLeave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.\nTo know our enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts,\nTheir papers is more lawful.\n[Reads.] ‘Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many opportunities to cut him off: if your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he return the conqueror: then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour. ‘Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant, ‘Goneril.’\nO indistinguish’d space of woman’s will!\nA plot upon her virtuous husband’s life,\nAnd the exchange my brother! Here in the sands\nThee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified\nOf murderous lechers: and in the mature time,\nWith this ungracious paper strike the sight\nOf the death-practis’d Duke: for him ’tis well\nThat of thy death and business I can tell.\n\n[Exit Edgar, dragging out the body.]\n\nGLOUCESTER.\nThe King is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,\nThat I stand up, and have ingenious feeling\nOf my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:\nSo should my thoughts be sever’d from my griefs,\nAnd woes by wrong imaginations lose\nThe knowledge of themselves.\n\n[A drum afar off.]\n\nEDGAR.\nGive me your hand.\nFar off methinks I hear the beaten drum.\nCome, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Officers and Attendants.\n\nALBANY.\nSir, you have show’d today your valiant strain,\nAnd fortune led you well: you have the captives\nWho were the opposites of this day’s strife:\nI do require them of you, so to use them\nAs we shall find their merits and our safety\nMay equally determine.\n\nEDMUND.\nSir, I thought it fit\nTo send the old and miserable King\nTo some retention and appointed guard;\nWhose age has charms in it, whose title more,\nTo pluck the common bosom on his side,\nAnd turn our impress’d lances in our eyes\nWhich do command them. With him I sent the queen;\nMy reason all the same; and they are ready\nTomorrow, or at further space, to appear\nWhere you shall hold your session. At this time\nWe sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;\nAnd the best quarrels in the heat are curs’d\nBy those that feel their sharpness.\nThe question of Cordelia and her father\nRequires a fitter place.\n\nALBANY.\nSir, by your patience,\nI hold you but a subject of this war,\nNot as a brother.\n\nREGAN.\nThat’s as we list to grace him.\nMethinks our pleasure might have been demanded\nEre you had spoke so far. He led our powers;\nBore the commission of my place and person;\nThe which immediacy may well stand up\nAnd call itself your brother.\n\nGONERIL.\nNot so hot:\nIn his own grace he doth exalt himself,\nMore than in your addition.\n\nREGAN.\nIn my rights,\nBy me invested, he compeers the best.\n\nALBANY.\nThat were the most, if he should husband you.\n\nREGAN.\nJesters do oft prove prophets.\n\nGONERIL.\nHolla, holla!\nThat eye that told you so look’d but asquint.\n\nREGAN.\nLady, I am not well; else I should answer\nFrom a full-flowing stomach. General,\nTake thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;\nDispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:\nWitness the world that I create thee here\nMy lord and master.\n\nGONERIL.\nMean you to enjoy him?\n\nALBANY.\nThe let-alone lies not in your good will.\n\nEDMUND.\nNor in thine, lord.\n\nALBANY.\nHalf-blooded fellow, yes.\n\nREGAN.\n[To Edmund.] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\n\nALBANY.\nStay yet; hear reason: Edmund, I arrest thee\nOn capital treason; and, in thine arrest,\nThis gilded serpent. [pointing to Goneril.]\nFor your claim, fair sister,\nI bar it in the interest of my wife;\n’Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,\nAnd I her husband contradict your bans.\nIf you will marry, make your loves to me,\nMy lady is bespoke.\n\nGONERIL.\nAn interlude!\n\nALBANY.\nThou art arm’d, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound:\nIf none appear to prove upon thy person\nThy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,\nThere is my pledge. [Throwing down a glove.]\nI’ll make it on thy heart,\nEre I taste bread, thou art in nothing less\nThan I have here proclaim’d thee.\n\nREGAN.\nSick, O, sick!\n\nGONERIL.\n[Aside.] If not, I’ll ne’er trust medicine.\n\nEDMUND.\nThere’s my exchange. [Throwing down a glove.]\nWhat in the world he is\nThat names me traitor, villain-like he lies.\nCall by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,\nOn him, on you, who not? I will maintain\nMy truth and honour firmly.\n\nALBANY.\nA herald, ho!\n\nEnter a Herald.\n\nTrust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,\nAll levied in my name, have in my name\nTook their discharge.\n\nREGAN.\nMy sickness grows upon me.\n\nALBANY.\nShe is not well. Convey her to my tent.\n\n[Exit Regan, led.]\n\nCome hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound\nAnd read out this.\n\nOFFICER.\nSound, trumpet!\n\n[A trumpet sounds.]\n\nHERALD.\n[Reads.] ‘If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.’\n\nEDMUND.\nSound!\n\n[First trumpet.]\n\nHERALD.\nAgain!\n\n[Second trumpet.]\n\nHERALD.\nAgain!\n\nThird trumpet. Trumpet answers within. Enter Edgar, armed, preceded by a trumpet.\n\nALBANY.\nAsk him his purposes, why he appears\nUpon this call o’ the trumpet.\n\nHERALD.\nWhat are you?\nYour name, your quality? and why you answer\nThis present summons?\n\nEDGAR.\nKnow my name is lost;\nBy treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.\nYet am I noble as the adversary\nI come to cope.\n\nALBANY.\nWhich is that adversary?\n\nEDGAR.\nWhat’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?\n\nEDMUND.\nHimself, what say’st thou to him?\n\nEDGAR.\nDraw thy sword,\nThat if my speech offend a noble heart,\nThy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.\nBehold, it is the privilege of mine honours,\nMy oath, and my profession: I protest,\nMaugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,\nDespite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,\nThy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;\nFalse to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;\nConspirant ’gainst this high illustrious prince;\nAnd, from the extremest upward of thy head\nTo the descent and dust beneath thy foot,\nA most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou ‘No,’\nThis sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent\nTo prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,\nThou liest.\n\nEDMUND.\nIn wisdom I should ask thy name;\nBut since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,\nAnd that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,\nWhat safe and nicely I might well delay\nBy rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.\nBack do I toss those treasons to thy head,\nWith the hell-hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart;\nWhich for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,\nThis sword of mine shall give them instant way,\nWhere they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!\n\n[Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls.]\n\nALBANY.\nSave him, save him!\n\nGONERIL.\nThis is mere practice, Gloucester:\nBy the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer\nAn unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish’d,\nBut cozen’d and beguil’d.\n\nALBANY.\nShut your mouth, dame,\nOr with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir;\nThou worse than any name, read thine own evil.\nNo tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.\n\n[Gives the letter to Edmund.]\n\nGONERIL.\nSay if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:\nWho can arraign me for’t?\n\n[Exit.]\n\nALBANY.\nMost monstrous! O!\nKnow’st thou this paper?\n\nEDMUND.\nAsk me not what I know.\n\nALBANY.\n[To an Officer, who goes out.] Go after her; she’s desperate; govern her.\n\nEDMUND.\nWhat you have charg’d me with, that have I done;\nAnd more, much more; the time will bring it out.\n’Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou\nThat hast this fortune on me? If thou’rt noble,\nI do forgive thee.\n\nEDGAR.\nLet’s exchange charity.\nI am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\nIf more, the more thou hast wrong’d me.\nMy name is Edgar and thy father’s son.\nThe gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\nMake instruments to plague us:\nThe dark and vicious place where thee he got\nCost him his eyes.\n\nEDMUND.\nThou hast spoken right, ’tis true;\nThe wheel is come full circle; I am here.\n\nALBANY.\nMethought thy very gait did prophesy\nA royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.\nLet sorrow split my heart if ever I\nDid hate thee or thy father.\n\nEDGAR.\nWorthy prince, I know’t.\n\nALBANY.\nWhere have you hid yourself?\nHow have you known the miseries of your father?\n\nEDGAR.\nBy nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;\nAnd when ’tis told, O that my heart would burst!\nThe bloody proclamation to escape\nThat follow’d me so near,—O, our lives’ sweetness!\nThat with the pain of death we’d hourly die\nRather than die at once!—taught me to shift\nInto a madman’s rags; t’assume a semblance\nThat very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit\nMet I my father with his bleeding rings,\nTheir precious stones new lost; became his guide,\nLed him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair;\nNever,—O fault!—reveal’d myself unto him\nUntil some half hour past, when I was arm’d;\nNot sure, though hoping of this good success,\nI ask’d his blessing, and from first to last\nTold him my pilgrimage. But his flaw’d heart,\nAlack, too weak the conflict to support!\n’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\nBurst smilingly.\n\nEDMUND.\nThis speech of yours hath mov’d me,\nAnd shall perchance do good, but speak you on;\nYou look as you had something more to say.\n\nALBANY.\nIf there be more, more woeful, hold it in;\nFor I am almost ready to dissolve,\nHearing of this.\n\nEDGAR.\nThis would have seem’d a period\nTo such as love not sorrow; but another,\nTo amplify too much, would make much more,\nAnd top extremity.\nWhilst I was big in clamour, came there a man\nWho, having seen me in my worst estate,\nShunn’d my abhorr’d society; but then finding\nWho ’twas that so endur’d, with his strong arms\nHe fastened on my neck, and bellow’d out\nAs he’d burst heaven; threw him on my father;\nTold the most piteous tale of Lear and him\nThat ever ear receiv’d, which in recounting\nHis grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\nBegan to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,\nAnd there I left him tranc’d.\n\nALBANY.\nBut who was this?\n\nEDGAR.\nKent, sir, the banish’d Kent; who in disguise\nFollow’d his enemy king and did him service\nImproper for a slave.\n\nEnter a Gentleman hastily, with a bloody knife.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nHelp, help! O, help!\n\nEDGAR.\nWhat kind of help?\n\nALBANY.\nSpeak, man.\n\nEDGAR.\nWhat means this bloody knife?\n\nGENTLEMAN.\n’Tis hot, it smokes;\nIt came even from the heart of—O! she’s dead!\n\nALBANY.\nWho dead? Speak, man.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nYour lady, sir, your lady; and her sister\nBy her is poisoned; she hath confesses it.\n\nEDMUND.\nI was contracted to them both, all three\nNow marry in an instant.\n\nEDGAR.\nHere comes Kent.\n\nEnter Kent.\n\nALBANY.\nProduce their bodies, be they alive or dead.\nThis judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble\nTouches us not with pity. O, is this he?\nThe time will not allow the compliment\nWhich very manners urges.\n\nKENT.\nI am come\nTo bid my King and master aye good night:\nIs he not here?\n\nALBANY.\nGreat thing of us forgot!\nSpeak, Edmund, where’s the King? and where’s Cordelia?\n\nThe bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.\n\nSeest thou this object, Kent?\n\nKENT.\nAlack, why thus?\n\nEDMUND.\nYet Edmund was belov’d.\nThe one the other poisoned for my sake,\nAnd after slew herself.\n\nALBANY.\nEven so. Cover their faces.\n\nEDMUND.\nI pant for life. Some good I mean to do,\nDespite of mine own nature. Quickly send,\nBe brief in it, to the castle; for my writ\nIs on the life of Lear and on Cordelia;\nNay, send in time.\n\nALBANY.\nRun, run, O, run!\n\nEDGAR.\nTo who, my lord? Who has the office? Send\nThy token of reprieve.\n\nEDMUND.\nWell thought on: take my sword,\nGive it the captain.\n\nEDGAR.\nHaste thee for thy life.\n\n[Exit Edgar.]\n\nEDMUND.\nHe hath commission from thy wife and me\nTo hang Cordelia in the prison, and\nTo lay the blame upon her own despair,\nThat she fordid herself.\n\nALBANY.\nThe gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.\n\n[Edmund is borne off.]\n\nEnter Lear with Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar, Officer and others following.\n\nLEAR.\nHowl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.\nHad I your tongues and eyes, I’ld use them so\nThat heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone for ever!\nI know when one is dead, and when one lives;\nShe’s dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass;\nIf that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\nWhy, then she lives.\n\nKENT.\nIs this the promis’d end?\n\nEDGAR.\nOr image of that horror?\n\nALBANY.\nFall, and cease!\n\nLEAR.\nThis feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,\nIt is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\nThat ever I have felt.\n\nKENT.\nO, my good master! [Kneeling.]\n\nLEAR.\nPrythee, away!\n\nEDGAR.\n’Tis noble Kent, your friend.\n\nLEAR.\nA plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!\nI might have sav’d her; now she’s gone for ever!\nCordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!\nWhat is’t thou say’st? Her voice was ever soft,\nGentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.\nI kill’d the slave that was a-hanging thee.\n\nOFFICER.\n’Tis true, my lords, he did.\n\nLEAR.\nDid I not, fellow?\nI have seen the day, with my good biting falchion\nI would have made them skip. I am old now,\nAnd these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?\nMine eyes are not o’ the best, I’ll tell you straight.\n\nKENT.\nIf Fortune brag of two she lov’d and hated,\nOne of them we behold.\n\nLEAR.\nThis is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?\n\nKENT.\nThe same,\nYour servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?\n\nLEAR.\nHe’s a good fellow, I can tell you that;\nHe’ll strike, and quickly too:. He’s dead and rotten.\n\nKENT.\nNo, my good lord; I am the very man.\n\nLEAR.\nI’ll see that straight.\n\nKENT.\nThat from your first of difference and decay\nHave follow’d your sad steps.\n\nLEAR.\nYou are welcome hither.\n\nKENT.\nNor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark and deadly.\nYour eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\nAnd desperately are dead.\n\nLEAR.\nAy, so I think.\n\nALBANY.\nHe knows not what he says; and vain is it\nThat we present us to him.\n\nEDGAR.\nVery bootless.\n\nEnter an Officer.\n\nOFFICER.\nEdmund is dead, my lord.\n\nALBANY.\nThat’s but a trifle here.\nYou lords and noble friends, know our intent.\nWhat comfort to this great decay may come\nShall be applied. For us, we will resign,\nDuring the life of this old majesty,\nTo him our absolute power;\n[to Edgar and Kent] you to your rights;\nWith boot and such addition as your honours\nHave more than merited. All friends shall taste\nThe wages of their virtue and all foes\nThe cup of their deservings. O, see, see!\n\nLEAR.\nAnd my poor fool is hang’d! No, no, no life!\nWhy should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,\nAnd thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,\nNever, never, never, never, never!\nPray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.\nDo you see this? Look on her: look, her lips,\nLook there, look there!\n\n[He dies.]\n\nEDGAR.\nHe faints! My lord, my lord!\n\nKENT.\nBreak, heart; I prythee break!\n\nEDGAR.\nLook up, my lord.\n\nKENT.\nVex not his ghost: O, let him pass! He hates him\nThat would upon the rack of this rough world\nStretch him out longer.\n\nEDGAR.\nHe is gone indeed.\n\nKENT.\nThe wonder is, he hath endur’d so long:\nHe but usurp’d his life.\n\nALBANY.\nBear them from hence. Our present business\nIs general woe. [To Edgar and Kent.] Friends of my soul, you twain,\nRule in this realm and the gor’d state sustain.\n\nKENT.\nI have a journey, sir, shortly to go;\nMy master calls me, I must not say no.\n\nEDGAR.\nThe weight of this sad time we must obey;\nSpeak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\nThe oldest hath borne most; we that are young\nShall never see so much, nor live so long.\n\n[Exeunt with a dead march.]",
