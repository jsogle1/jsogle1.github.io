What storm is this?\n\nEnter Chiron and Demetrius braving.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nChiron, thy years wants wit, thy wit wants edge\nAnd manners, to intrude where I am graced,\nAnd may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.\n\nCHIRON.\nDemetrius, thou dost overween in all,\nAnd so in this, to bear me down with braves.\n’Tis not the difference of a year or two\nMakes me less gracious or thee more fortunate.\nI am as able and as fit as thou\nTo serve and to deserve my mistress’ grace;\nAnd that my sword upon thee shall approve,\nAnd plead my passions for Lavinia’s love.\n\nAARON.\n[Aside.] Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWhy, boy, although our mother, unadvised,\nGave you a dancing-rapier by your side,\nAre you so desperate grown to threat your friends?\nGo to; have your lath glued within your sheath\nTill you know better how to handle it.\n\nCHIRON.\nMeanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,\nFull well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAy, boy, grow ye so brave?\n\n[They draw.]\n\nAARON.\nWhy, how now, lords!\nSo near the emperor’s palace dare ye draw,\nAnd maintain such a quarrel openly?\nFull well I wot the ground of all this grudge.\nI would not for a million of gold\nThe cause were known to them it most concerns;\nNor would your noble mother for much more\nBe so dishonoured in the court of Rome.\nFor shame, put up.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNot I, till I have sheathed\nMy rapier in his bosom, and withal\nThrust those reproachful speeches down his throat\nThat he hath breathed in my dishonour here.\n\nCHIRON.\nFor that I am prepared and full resolved,\nFoul-spoken coward, that thund’rest with thy tongue,\nAnd with thy weapon nothing dar’st perform.\n\nAARON.\nAway, I say!\nNow, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,\nThis pretty brabble will undo us all.\nWhy, lords, and think you not how dangerous\nIt is to jet upon a prince’s right?\nWhat, is Lavinia then become so loose,\nOr Bassianus so degenerate,\nThat for her love such quarrels may be broached\nWithout controlment, justice, or revenge?\nYoung lords, beware! And should the empress know\nThis discord’s ground, the music would not please.\n\nCHIRON.\nI care not, I, knew she and all the world.\nI love Lavinia more than all the world.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nYoungling, learn thou to make some meaner choice.\nLavina is thine elder brother’s hope.\n\nAARON.\nWhy, are ye mad? Or know ye not in Rome\nHow furious and impatient they be,\nAnd cannot brook competitors in love?\nI tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths\nBy this device.\n\nCHIRON.\nAaron, a thousand deaths\nWould I propose to achieve her whom I love.\n\nAARON.\nTo achieve her! How?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWhy makes thou it so strange?\nShe is a woman, therefore may be wooed;\nShe is a woman, therefore may be won;\nShe is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.\nWhat, man, more water glideth by the mill\nThan wots the miller of; and easy it is\nOf a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.\nThough Bassianus be the emperor’s brother,\nBetter than he have worn Vulcan’s badge.\n\nAARON.\n[Aside.] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nThen why should he despair that knows to court it\nWith words, fair looks, and liberality?\nWhat, hast not thou full often struck a doe,\nAnd borne her cleanly by the keeper’s nose?\n\nAARON.\nWhy, then, it seems some certain snatch or so\nWould serve your turns.\n\nCHIRON.\nAy, so the turn were served.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAaron, thou hast hit it.\n\nAARON.\nWould you had hit it too!\nThen should not we be tired with this ado.\nWhy, hark ye, hark ye, and are you such fools\nTo square for this? Would it offend you then\nThat both should speed?\n\nCHIRON.\nFaith, not me.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNor me, so I were one.\n\nAARON.\nFor shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.\n’Tis policy and stratagem must do\nThat you affect; and so must you resolve\nThat what you cannot as you would achieve,\nYou must perforce accomplish as you may.\nTake this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste\nThan this Lavinia, Bassianus’ love.\nA speedier course than ling’ring languishment\nMust we pursue, and I have found the path.\nMy lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;\nThere will the lovely Roman ladies troop.\nThe forest walks are wide and spacious,\nAnd many unfrequented plots there are\nFitted by kind for rape and villainy.\nSingle you thither, then, this dainty doe,\nAnd strike her home by force, if not by words.\nThis way, or not at all, stand you in hope.\nCome, come, our empress, with her sacred wit\nTo villainy and vengeance consecrate,\nWill we acquaint with all what we intend;\nAnd she shall file our engines with advice\nThat will not suffer you to square yourselves,\nBut to your wishes’ height advance you both.\nThe emperor’s court is like the house of Fame,\nThe palace full of tongues, of eyes and ears;\nThe woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.\nThere speak and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;\nThere serve your lust, shadowed from heaven’s eye,\nAnd revel in Lavinia’s treasury.\n\nCHIRON.\nThy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nSit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream\nTo cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,\nPer Stygia, per manes vehor.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

I come to thee.\n\n[Falls in.]\n\nEnter the Emperor Saturninus and Aaron the Moor.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nAlong with me! I’ll see what hole is here,\nAnd what he is that now is leapt into it.\nSay, who art thou that lately didst descend\nInto this gaping hollow of the earth?\n\nMARTIUS.\nThe unhappy sons of old Andronicus,\nBrought hither in a most unlucky hour,\nTo find thy brother Bassianus dead.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nMy brother dead! I know thou dost but jest.\nHe and his lady both are at the lodge\nUpon the north side of this pleasant chase;\n’Tis not an hour since I left them there.\n\nMARTIUS.\nWe know not where you left them all alive;\nBut, out, alas, here have we found him dead.\n\nEnter Tamora, Titus Andronicus and Lucius.\n\nTAMORA.\nWhere is my lord the king?\n\nSATURNINUS.\nHere, Tamora; though grieved with killing grief.\n\nTAMORA.\nWhere is thy brother Bassianus?\n\nSATURNINUS.\nNow to the bottom dost thou search my wound.\nPoor Bassianus here lies murdered.\n\nTAMORA.\nThen all too late I bring this fatal writ,\nThe complot of this timeless tragedy;\nAnd wonder greatly that man’s face can fold\nIn pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.\n\n[She giveth Saturnine a letter.]\n\nSATURNINUS.\n[Reads.] An if we miss to meet him handsomely,\nSweet huntsman, Bassianus ’tis we mean,\nDo thou so much as dig the grave for him;\nThou know’st our meaning. Look for thy reward\nAmong the nettles at the elder-tree\nWhich overshades the mouth of that same pit\nWhere we decreed to bury Bassianus.\nDo this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.\nO Tamora, was ever heard the like?\nThis is the pit, and this the elder-tree.\nLook, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out\nThat should have murdered Bassianus here.\n\nAARON.\nMy gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.\n\n[Showing it.]\n\nSATURNINUS.\n[To Titus.] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,\nHave here bereft my brother of his life.\nSirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison.\nThere let them bide until we have devised\nSome never-heard-of torturing pain for them.\n\nTAMORA.\nWhat, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!\nHow easily murder is discovered!\n\nTITUS.\nHigh emperor, upon my feeble knee\nI beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,\nThat this fell fault of my accursed sons,\nAccursed if the fault be proved in them—\n\nSATURNINUS.\nIf it be proved! You see it is apparent.\nWho found this letter? Tamora, was it you?\n\nTAMORA.\nAndronicus himself did take it up.\n\nTITUS.\nI did, my lord, yet let me be their bail;\nFor by my fathers’ reverend tomb I vow\nThey shall be ready at your highness’ will\nTo answer their suspicion with their lives.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nThou shalt not bail them. See thou follow me.\nSome bring the murdered body, some the murderers.\nLet them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;\nFor, by my soul, were there worse end than death,\nThat end upon them should be executed.\n\nTAMORA.\nAndronicus, I will entreat the king.\nFear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.\n\nTITUS.\nCome, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.\n\n[Exeunt severally.

A street\nEnter the Judges and Senators, with Titus’ two sons Quintus and Martius bound, passing on the stage to the place of execution, and Titus going before, pleading.\n\nTITUS.\nHear me, grave fathers; noble tribunes, stay!\nFor pity of mine age, whose youth was spent\nIn dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;\nFor all my blood in Rome’s great quarrel shed,\nFor all the frosty nights that I have watched,\nAnd for these bitter tears, which now you see\nFilling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,\nBe pitiful to my condemned sons,\nWhose souls are not corrupted as ’tis thought.\nFor two and twenty sons I never wept,\nBecause they died in honour’s lofty bed.\n\n[Andronicus lieth down, and the Judges pass by him.]\n\n[Exeunt with the prisoners as Titus continues speaking.]\n\nFor these, tribunes, in the dust I write\nMy heart’s deep languor and my soul’s sad tears.\nLet my tears staunch the earth’s dry appetite;\nMy sons’ sweet blood will make it shame and blush.\nO earth, I will befriend thee more with rain\nThat shall distil from these two ancient urns,\nThan youthful April shall with all his showers.\nIn summer’s drought I’ll drop upon thee still;\nIn winter with warm tears I’ll melt the snow,\nAnd keep eternal spring-time on thy face,\nSo thou refuse to drink my dear sons’ blood.\n\nEnter Lucius with his weapon drawn.\n\nO reverend tribunes! O gentle aged men!\nUnbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;\nAnd let me say, that never wept before,\nMy tears are now prevailing orators.\n\nLUCIUS.\nO noble father, you lament in vain.\nThe tribunes hear you not, no man is by;\nAnd you recount your sorrows to a stone.\n\nTITUS.\nAh, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.\nGrave tribunes, once more I entreat of you—\n\nLUCIUS.\nMy gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.\n\nTITUS.\nWhy, ’tis no matter, man. If they did hear,\nThey would not mark me; if they did mark,\nThey would not pity me, yet plead I must,\nAnd bootless unto them.\nTherefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,\nWho, though they cannot answer my distress,\nYet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,\nFor that they will not intercept my tale.\nWhen I do weep, they humbly at my feet\nReceive my tears, and seem to weep with me;\nAnd were they but attired in grave weeds,\nRome could afford no tribunes like to these.\nA stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones;\nA stone is silent, and offendeth not,\nAnd tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.\nBut wherefore stand’st thou with thy weapon drawn?\n\nLUCIUS.\nTo rescue my two brothers from their death;\nFor which attempt the judges have pronounced\nMy everlasting doom of banishment.\n\nTITUS.\nO happy man, they have befriended thee.\nWhy, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive\nThat Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?\nTigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey\nBut me and mine. How happy art thou then,\nFrom these devourers to be banished!\nBut who comes with our brother Marcus here?\n\nEnter Marcus with Lavinia.\n\nMARCUS.\nTitus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;\nOr if not so, thy noble heart to break.\nI bring consuming sorrow to thine age.\n\nTITUS.\nWill it consume me? Let me see it then.\n\nMARCUS.\nThis was thy daughter.\n\nTITUS.\nWhy, Marcus, so she is.\n\nLUCIUS.\nAy me, this object kills me!\n\nTITUS.\nFaint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.\nSpeak, Lavinia, what accursed hand\nHath made thee handless in thy father’s sight?\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea,\nOr brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?\nMy grief was at the height before thou cam’st,\nAnd now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.\nGive me a sword, I’ll chop off my hands too;\nFor they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;\nAnd they have nursed this woe in feeding life;\nIn bootless prayer have they been held up,\nAnd they have served me to effectless use.\nNow all the service I require of them\nIs that the one will help to cut the other.\n’Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,\nFor hands to do Rome service is but vain.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSpeak, gentle sister, who hath martyred thee?\n\nMARCUS.\nO, that delightful engine of her thoughts,\nThat blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence,\nIs torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,\nWhere, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung\nSweet varied notes, enchanting every ear.\n\nLUCIUS.\nO, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?\n\nMARCUS.\nO, thus I found her straying in the park,\nSeeking to hide herself, as doth the deer\nThat hath received some unrecuring wound.\n\nTITUS.\nIt was my dear, and he that wounded her\nHath hurt me more than had he killed me dead.\nFor now I stand as one upon a rock,\nEnvironed with a wilderness of sea,\nWho marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,\nExpecting ever when some envious surge\nWill in his brinish bowels swallow him.\nThis way to death my wretched sons are gone;\nHere stands my other son, a banished man,\nAnd here my brother, weeping at my woes.\nBut that which gives my soul the greatest spurn\nIs dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.\nHad I but seen thy picture in this plight\nIt would have madded me. What shall I do\nNow I behold thy lively body so?\nThou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,\nNor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee.\nThy husband he is dead, and for his death\nThy brothers are condemned, and dead by this.\nLook, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!\nWhen I did name her brothers, then fresh tears\nStood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew\nUpon a gathered lily almost withered.\n\nMARCUS.\nPerchance she weeps because they killed her husband;\nPerchance because she knows them innocent.\n\nTITUS.\nIf they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,\nBecause the law hath ta’en revenge on them.\nNo, no, they would not do so foul a deed;\nWitness the sorrow that their sister makes.\nGentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,\nOr make some sign how I may do thee ease.\nShall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,\nAnd thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,\nLooking all downwards to behold our cheeks\nHow they are stained, like meadows yet not dry,\nWith miry slime left on them by a flood?\nAnd in the fountain shall we gaze so long\nTill the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,\nAnd made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?\nOr shall we cut away our hands like thine?\nOr shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows\nPass the remainder of our hateful days?\nWhat shall we do? Let us that have our tongues\nPlot some device of further misery,\nTo make us wondered at in time to come.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief\nSee how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.\n\nMARCUS.\nPatience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.\n\nTITUS.\nAh, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot\nThy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,\nFor thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own.\n\nLUCIUS.\nAh, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.\n\nTITUS.\nMark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.\nHad she a tongue to speak, now would she say\nThat to her brother which I said to thee.\nHis napkin, with his true tears all bewet,\nCan do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.\nO, what a sympathy of woe is this,\nAs far from help as limbo is from bliss.\n\nEnter Aaron the Moor, alone.\n\nAARON.\nTitus Andronicus, my lord the emperor\nSends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,\nLet Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,\nOr any one of you, chop off your hand\nAnd send it to the king; he for the same\nWill send thee hither both thy sons alive,\nAnd that shall be the ransom for their fault.\n\nTITUS.\nO gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!\nDid ever raven sing so like a lark\nThat gives sweet tidings of the sun’s uprise?\nWith all my heart I’ll send the emperor my hand.\nGood Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?\n\nLUCIUS.\nStay, father, for that noble hand of thine,\nThat hath thrown down so many enemies,\nShall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn.\nMy youth can better spare my blood than you;\nAnd therefore mine shall save my brothers’ lives.\n\nMARCUS.\nWhich of your hands hath not defended Rome,\nAnd reared aloft the bloody battle-axe,\nWriting destruction on the enemy’s castle?\nO, none of both but are of high desert.\nMy hand hath been but idle; let it serve\nTo ransom my two nephews from their death;\nThen have I kept it to a worthy end.\n\nAARON.\nNay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,\nFor fear they die before their pardon come.\n\nMARCUS.\nMy hand shall go.\n\nLUCIUS.\nBy heaven, it shall not go!\n\nTITUS.\nSirs, strive no more. Such withered herbs as these\nAre meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.\n\nLUCIUS.\nSweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,\nLet me redeem my brothers both from death.\n\nMARCUS.\nAnd for our father’s sake and mother’s care,\nNow let me show a brother’s love to thee.\n\nTITUS.\nAgree between you; I will spare my hand.\n\nLUCIUS.\nThen I’ll go fetch an axe.\n\nMARCUS.\nBut I will use the axe.\n\n[Exeunt Lucius and Marcus.]\n\nTITUS.\nCome hither, Aaron; I’ll deceive them both.\nLend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.\n\nAARON.\n[Aside.] If that be called deceit, I will be honest,\nAnd never whilst I live deceive men so.\nBut I’ll deceive you in another sort,\nAnd that you’ll say ere half an hour pass.\n\n[He cuts off Titus’s hand.]\n\nEnter Lucius and Marcus again.\n\nTITUS.\nNow stay your strife. What shall be is dispatched.\nGood Aaron, give his majesty my hand.\nTell him it was a hand that warded him\nFrom thousand dangers, bid him bury it;\nMore hath it merited, that let it have.\nAs for my sons, say I account of them\nAs jewels purchased at an easy price;\nAnd yet dear too, because I bought mine own.\n\nAARON.\nI go, Andronicus; and for thy hand\nLook by and by to have thy sons with thee.\n[Aside.] Their heads, I mean. O, how this villainy\nDoth fat me with the very thoughts of it!\nLet fools do good, and fair men call for grace,\nAaron will have his soul black like his face.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTITUS.\nO, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,\nAnd bow this feeble ruin to the earth.\nIf any power pities wretched tears,\nTo that I call! [To Lavinia.] What, wouldst thou kneel with me?\nDo, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers,\nOr with our sighs we’ll breathe the welkin dim,\nAnd stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds\nWhen they do hug him in their melting bosoms.\n\nMARCUS.\nO brother, speak with possibility,\nAnd do not break into these deep extremes.\n\nTITUS.\nIs not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?\nThen be my passions bottomless with them.\n\nMARCUS.\nBut yet let reason govern thy lament.\n\nTITUS.\nIf there were reason for these miseries,\nThen into limits could I bind my woes.\nWhen heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o’erflow?\nIf the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,\nThreatening the welkin with his big-swol’n face?\nAnd wilt thou have a reason for this coil?\nI am the sea. Hark how her sighs doth flow!\nShe is the weeping welkin, I the earth.\nThen must my sea be moved with her sighs;\nThen must my earth with her continual tears\nBecome a deluge, overflowed and drowned;\nFor why my bowels cannot hide her woes,\nBut like a drunkard must I vomit them.\nThen give me leave, for losers will have leave\nTo ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.\n\nEnter a Messenger with two heads and a hand.\n\nMESSENGER.\nWorthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid\nFor that good hand thou sent’st the emperor.\nHere are the heads of thy two noble sons,\nAnd here’s thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back.\nThy grief their sports, thy resolution mocked;\nThat woe is me to think upon thy woes,\nMore than remembrance of my father’s death.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nMARCUS.\nNow let hot Etna cool in Sicily,\nAnd be my heart an ever-burning hell!\nThese miseries are more than may be borne.\nTo weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,\nBut sorrow flouted at is double death.\n\nLUCIUS.\nAh, that this sight should make so deep a wound,\nAnd yet detested life not shrink thereat!\nThat ever death should let life bear his name,\nWhere life hath no more interest but to breathe!\n\n[Lavinia kisses Titus.]\n\nMARCUS.\nAlas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless\nAs frozen water to a starved snake.\n\nTITUS.\nWhen will this fearful slumber have an end?\n\nMARCUS.\nNow farewell, flattery; die, Andronicus;\nThou dost not slumber. See thy two sons’ heads,\nThy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here;\nThy other banished son with this dear sight\nStruck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,\nEven like a stony image, cold and numb.\nAh, now no more will I control thy griefs.\nRent off thy silver hair, thy other hand\nGnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight\nThe closing up of our most wretched eyes.\nNow is a time to storm; why art thou still?\n\nTITUS.\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nMARCUS.\nWhy dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.\n\nTITUS.\nWhy, I have not another tear to shed.\nBesides, this sorrow is an enemy,\nAnd would usurp upon my watery eyes,\nAnd make them blind with tributary tears.\nThen which way shall I find Revenge’s cave?\nFor these two heads do seem to speak to me,\nAnd threat me I shall never come to bliss\nTill all these mischiefs be returned again\nEven in their throats that have committed them.\nCome, let me see what task I have to do.\nYou heavy people, circle me about,\nThat I may turn me to each one of you,\nAnd swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.\nThe vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;\nAnd in this hand the other will I bear.\nAnd, Lavinia, thou shalt be employed in these arms.\nBear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.\nAs for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;\nThou art an exile, and thou must not stay.\nHie to the Goths, and raise an army there.\nAnd if you love me, as I think you do,\nLet’s kiss and part, for we have much to do.\n\n[Exeunt Titus, Marcus and Lavinia.]\n\nLUCIUS.\nFarewell, Andronicus, my noble father,\nThe woefull’st man that ever lived in Rome.\nFarewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again;\nHe loves his pledges dearer than his life.\nFarewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;\nO, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!\nBut now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives\nBut in oblivion and hateful griefs.\nIf Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs,\nAnd make proud Saturnine and his empress\nBeg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.\nNow will I to the Goths, and raise a power\nTo be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Rome. A Room in Titus’s House. A banquet set out\nEnter Titus Andronicus, Marcus, Lavinia and the boy Young Lucius.\n\nTITUS.\nSo so; now sit; and look you eat no more\nThan will preserve just so much strength in us\nAs will revenge these bitter woes of ours.\nMarcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot.\nThy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,\nAnd cannot passionate our tenfold grief\nWith folded arms. This poor right hand of mine\nIs left to tyrannize upon my breast;\nWho when my heart, all mad with misery,\nBeats in this hollow prison of my flesh,\nThen thus I thump it down.\nThou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs,\nWhen thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,\nThou canst not strike it thus to make it still.\nWound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;\nOr get some little knife between thy teeth,\nAnd just against thy heart make thou a hole,\nThat all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall\nMay run into that sink, and, soaking in,\nDrown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.\n\nMARCUS.\nFie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay\nSuch violent hands upon her tender life.\n\nTITUS.\nHow now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?\nWhy, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.\nWhat violent hands can she lay on her life?\nAh, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,\nTo bid Æneas tell the tale twice o’er\nHow Troy was burnt and he made miserable?\nO, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,\nLest we remember still that we have none.\nFie, fie, how frantically I square my talk,\nAs if we should forget we had no hands,\nIf Marcus did not name the word of hands!\nCome, let’s fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this.\nHere is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;\nI can interpret all her martyred signs.\nShe says she drinks no other drink but tears,\nBrewed with her sorrow, meshed upon her cheeks.\nSpeechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;\nIn thy dumb action will I be as perfect\nAs begging hermits in their holy prayers.\nThou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,\nNor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,\nBut I of these will wrest an alphabet,\nAnd by still practice learn to know thy meaning.\n\nYOUNG LUCIUS.\nGood grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments.\nMake my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.\n\nMARCUS.\nAlas, the tender boy, in passion moved,\nDoth weep to see his grandsire’s heaviness.\n\nTITUS.\nPeace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,\nAnd tears will quickly melt thy life away.\n\n[Marcus strikes the dish with a knife.]\n\nWhat dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?\n\nMARCUS.\nAt that that I have killed, my lord, a fly.\n\nTITUS.\nOut on thee, murderer! Thou kill’st my heart;\nMine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny;\nA deed of death done on the innocent\nBecomes not Titus’ brother.

How if that fly had a father and mother?\nHow would he hang his slender gilded wings\nAnd buzz lamenting doings in the air!\nPoor harmless fly,\nThat with his pretty buzzing melody,\nCame here to make us merry, and thou hast killed him.\n\nMARCUS.\nPardon me, sir; ’twas a black ill-favoured fly,\nLike to the empress’ Moor; therefore I killed him.\n\nTITUS.\nO, O, O!\nThen pardon me for reprehending thee,\nFor thou hast done a charitable deed.\nGive me thy knife, I will insult on him,\nFlattering myself as if it were the Moor\nCome hither purposely to poison me.\nThere’s for thyself, and that’s for Tamora.\nAh, sirrah!\nYet, I think, we are not brought so low\nBut that between us we can kill a fly\nThat comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.\n\nMARCUS.\nAlas, poor man, grief has so wrought on him,\nHe takes false shadows for true substances.\n\nTITUS.\nCome, take away. Lavinia, go with me.\nI’ll to thy closet, and go read with thee\nSad stories chanced in the times of old.\nCome, boy, and go with me.

You, cousins, shall\nGo sound the ocean and cast your nets;\nHappily you may catch her in the sea;\nYet there’s as little justice as at land.\nNo; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;\n’Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,\nAnd pierce the inmost centre of the earth.\nThen, when you come to Pluto’s region,\nI pray you, deliver him this petition;\nTell him it is for justice and for aid,\nAnd that it comes from old Andronicus,\nShaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.\nAh, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable\nWhat time I threw the people’s suffrages\nOn him that thus doth tyrannize o’er me.\nGo, get you gone; and pray be careful all,\nAnd leave you not a man-of-war unsearched.\nThis wicked emperor may have shipped her hence;\nAnd, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.\n\nMARCUS.\nO Publius, is not this a heavy case,\nTo see thy noble uncle thus distract?\n\nPUBLIUS.\nTherefore, my lords, it highly us concerns\nBy day and night to attend him carefully,\nAnd feed his humour kindly as we may,\nTill time beget some careful remedy.\n\nMARCUS.\nKinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy,\nBut . . . .\nJoin with the Goths, and with revengeful war\nTake wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,\nAnd vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.\n\nTITUS.\nPublius, how now? How now, my masters?\nWhat, have you met with her?\n\nPUBLIUS.\nNo, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,\nIf you will have Revenge from hell, you shall.\nMarry, for Justice, she is so employed,\nHe thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,\nSo that perforce you must needs stay a time.\n\nTITUS.\nHe doth me wrong to feed me with delays.\nI’ll dive into the burning lake below,\nAnd pull her out of Acheron by the heels.\nMarcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,\nNo big-boned men framed of the Cyclops’ size;\nBut metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,\nYet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear;\nAnd sith there’s no justice in earth nor hell,\nWe will solicit heaven and move the gods\nTo send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.\nCome, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus.\n\n[He gives them the arrows.]\n\n“Ad Jovem,” that’s for you; here, “Ad Apollinem”;\n“Ad Martem,” that’s for myself;\nHere, boy, “to Pallas”; here, “to Mercury”;\n“To Saturn,” Caius, not to Saturnine;\nYou were as good to shoot against the wind.\nTo it, boy.—Marcus, loose when I bid.—\nOf my word, I have written to effect;\nThere’s not a god left unsolicited.\n\nMARCUS.\nKinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court.\nWe will afflict the emperor in his pride.\n\nTITUS.\nNow, masters, draw.

Why, I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperal’s men.\n\nMARCUS.\nWhy, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you.\n\nTITUS.\nTell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace?\n\nCLOWN.\nNay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.\n\nTITUS.\nSirrah, come hither.

And when you come to him, at the first approach you must kneel; then kiss his foot; then deliver up your pigeons; and then look for your reward. I’ll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.\n\nCLOWN.\nI warrant you, sir; let me alone.\n\nTITUS.\nSirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.\nHere, Marcus, fold it in the oration;\nFor thou hast made it like a humble suppliant.\nAnd when thou hast given it to the emperor,\nKnock at my door, and tell me what he says.\n\nCLOWN.\nGod be with you, sir; I will.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTITUS.\nCome, Marcus, let us go.

The Emperor brings the arrows in his hand that Titus shot at him.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nWhy, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen\nAn emperor in Rome thus overborne,\nTroubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent\nOf legal justice, used in such contempt?\nMy lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,\nHowever these disturbers of our peace\nBuzz in the people’s ears, there naught hath passed\nBut even with law against the wilful sons\nOf old Andronicus. And what an if\nHis sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits?\nShall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,\nHis fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?\nAnd now he writes to heaven for his redress!\nSee, here’s “to Jove,” and this “to Mercury,”\nThis “to Apollo,” this to the god of war.\nSweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!\nWhat’s this but libelling against the senate,\nAnd blazoning our injustice everywhere?\nA goodly humour, is it not, my lords?\nAs who would say, in Rome no justice were.\nBut if I live, his feigned ecstasies\nShall be no shelter to these outrages;\nBut he and his shall know that justice lives\nIn Saturninus’ health; whom, if she sleep,\nHe’ll so awake as he in fury shall\nCut off the proud’st conspirator that lives.\n\nTAMORA.\nMy gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,\nLord of my life, commander of my thoughts,\nCalm thee, and bear the faults of Titus’ age,\nTh’ effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,\nWhose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart;\nAnd rather comfort his distressed plight\nThan prosecute the meanest or the best\nFor these contempts. [Aside.] Why, thus it shall become\nHigh-witted Tamora to gloze with all.\nBut, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick;\nThy life-blood out, if Aaron now be wise,\nThen is all safe, the anchor in the port.\n\nEnter Clown.\n\nHow now, good fellow, wouldst thou speak with us?\n\nCLOWN.\nYes, forsooth, an your mistresship be emperial.\n\nTAMORA.\nEmpress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.\n\nCLOWN.\n’Tis he.

Rome never had more cause.\nThe Goths have gathered head, and with a power\nOf high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,\nThey hither march amain, under conduct\nOf Lucius, son to old Andronicus;\nWho threats, in course of this revenge, to do\nAs much as ever Coriolanus did.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nIs warlike Lucius general of the Goths?\nThese tidings nip me, and I hang the head\nAs flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms.\nAy, now begins our sorrows to approach.\n’Tis he the common people love so much;\nMyself hath often overheard them say,\nWhen I have walked like a private man,\nThat Lucius’ banishment was wrongfully,\nAnd they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.\n\nTAMORA.\nWhy should you fear? Is not your city strong?\n\nSATURNINUS.\nAy, but the citizens favour Lucius,\nAnd will revolt from me to succour him.\n\nTAMORA.\nKing, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name.\nIs the sun dimmed, that gnats do fly in it?\nThe eagle suffers little birds to sing,\nAnd is not careful what they mean thereby,\nKnowing that with the shadow of his wings\nHe can at pleasure stint their melody;\nEven so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome.\nThen cheer thy spirit; for know, thou emperor,\nI will enchant the old Andronicus\nWith words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,\nThan baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep,\nWhenas the one is wounded with the bait,\nThe other rotted with delicious feed.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nBut he will not entreat his son for us.\n\nTAMORA.\nIf Tamora entreat him, then he will,\nFor I can smooth and fill his aged ears\nWith golden promises, that, were his heart\nAlmost impregnable, his old ears deaf,\nYet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.\n[to Aemilius] Go thou before, be our ambassador.\nSay that the emperor requests a parley\nOf warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting\nEven at his father’s house, the old Andronicus.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nAemilius, do this message honourably,\nAnd if he stand on hostage for his safety,\nBid him demand what pledge will please him best.\n\nAEMILIUS.\nYour bidding shall I do effectually.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTAMORA.\nNow will I to that old Andronicus,\nAnd temper him with all the art I have,\nTo pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.\nAnd now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,\nAnd bury all thy fear in my devices.\n\nSATURNINUS.\nThen go successantly, and plead to him.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
