no man answer in a case of truth?\nSUFFOLK\nWithin the Temple-hall we were too loud;\nThe garden here is more convenient.\nRICHARD\nPLANTAGENET\nThen say at once if I maintain'd the truth;\nOr else was wrangling Somerset in the error?\nSUFFOLK\nFaith, I have been a truant in the law,\nAnd never yet could frame my will to it;\nAnd therefore frame the law unto my will.\nSOMERSET\nJudge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.\nWARWICK\nBetween two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;\nBetween two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;\nBetween two blades, which bears the better temper:\nBetween two horses, which doth bear him best;\nBetween two girls, which hath the merriest eye;\nI have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;\nBut in these nice sharp quillets of the

out.\nSOMERSET\nAnd on my side it is so well apparell'd,\nSo clear, so shining and so evident\nThat it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.\nRICHARD\nPLANTAGENET\nSince you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,\nIn dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:\nLet him that is a true-born gentleman\nAnd stands upon the honour of his birth,\nIf he suppose that I have pleaded truth,\nFrom off this

root?\nRICHARD\nPLANTAGENET\nHe bears him on the place's privilege,\nOr durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.\nSOMERSET\nBy him that made me, I'll maintain my words\nOn any plot of ground in Christendom.\nWas not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,\nFor treason executed in our late king's days?\nAnd, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,\nCorrupted, and exempt from ancient

Pause, and take thy breath;\nI gave thee life and rescued thee from death.\nJOHN TALBOT\nO, twice my father, twice am I thy son!\nThe life thou gavest me first was lost and done,\nTill with thy warlike sword, despite of late,\nTo my determined time thou gavest new date.\nTALBOT\nWhen from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,\nIt warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire\nOf bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,\nQuicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,\nBeat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,\nAnd from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.\nThe ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood\nFrom thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood\nOf thy first fight, I soon encountered,\nAnd interchanging blows I quickly shed\nSome of his bastard blood; and in disgrace\nBespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base\nAnd misbegotten blood I spill of thine,\nMean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine\nWhich thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'\nHere, purposing the Bastard to destroy,\nCame in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,\nArt thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?\nWilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,\nNow thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?\nFly, to revenge my death when I am dead:\nThe help of one stands me in little stead.\nO, too much folly is it, well I wot,\nTo hazard all our lives in one small boat!\nIf I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,\nTo-morrow I shall die with mickle age:\nBy me they nothing gain an if I stay;\n'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:\nIn thee thy mother dies, our household's name,\nMy death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:\nAll these and more we hazard by thy stay;\nAll these are saved if thou wilt fly away.\nJOHN TALBOT\nThe sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;\nThese words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:\nOn that advantage, bought with such a shame,\nTo save a paltry life and slay bright fame,\nBefore young Talbot from old Talbot fly,\nThe coward horse that bears me fail and die!\nAnd like me to the peasant boys of France,\nTo be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!\nSurely, by all the glory you have won,\nAn if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:\nThen talk no more of flight, it is no boot;\nIf son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.\nTALBOT\nThen follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,\nThou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:\nIf thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;\nAnd, commendable proved, let's die in pride.\nExeunt",

I think she knows not well,\nThere were so many, whom she may accuse.\nWARWICK\nIt's sign she hath been liberal and free.\nYORK\nAnd yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.\nStrumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:\nUse no entreaty, for it is in vain.\nJOAN LA PUCELLE\nThen lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:\nMay never glorious sun reflex his beams\nUpon the country where you make abode;\nBut darkness and the gloomy shade of death\nEnviron you, till mischief and despair\nDrive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!\nExit, guarded\n\nYORK\nBreak thou in pieces and consume to ashes,\nThou foul accursed minister of hell!\nEnter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended\n\nCARDINAL\nOF WINCHESTER\nLord regent, I do greet your excellence\nWith letters of commission from the king.\nFor know, my lords, the states of Christendom,\nMoved with remorse of these outrageous broils,\nHave earnestly implored a general peace\nBetwixt our nation and the aspiring French;\nAnd here at hand the Dauphin and his train\nApproacheth, to confer about some matter.\nYORK\nIs all our travail turn'd to this effect?\nAfter the slaughter of so many peers,\nSo many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,\nThat in this quarrel have been overthrown\nAnd sold their bodies for their country's benefit,\nShall we at last conclude effeminate peace?\nHave we not lost most part of all the towns,\nBy treason, falsehood and by treachery,\nOur great progenitors had conquered?\nO Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief\nThe utter loss of all the realm of France.\nWARWICK\nBe patient, York: if we conclude a peace,\nIt shall be with such strict and severe covenants\nAs little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.\nEnter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, and others\n\nCHARLES\nSince, lords of England, it is thus agreed\nThat peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,\nWe come to be informed by yourselves\nWhat the conditions of that league must be.\nYORK\nSpeak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes\nThe hollow passage of my poison'd voice,\nBy sight of these our baleful enemies.\nCARDINAL\nOF WINCHESTER\nCharles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:\nThat, in regard King Henry gives consent,\nOf mere compassion and of lenity,\nTo ease your country of distressful war,\nAnd suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,\nYou shall become true liegemen to his crown:\nAnd Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear\nTo pay him tribute, submit thyself,\nThou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,\nAnd still enjoy thy regal dignity.\nALENCON\nMust he be then as shadow of himself?\nAdorn his temples with a coronet,\nAnd yet, in substance and authority,\nRetain but privilege of a private man?\nThis proffer is absurd and reasonless.\nCHARLES\n'Tis known already that I am possess'd\nWith more than half the Gallian territories,\nAnd therein reverenced for their lawful king:\nShall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,\nDetract so much from that prerogative,\nAs to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?\nNo, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep\nThat which I have than, coveting for more,\nBe cast from possibility of all.\nYORK\nInsulting Charles! hast thou by secret means\nUsed intercession to obtain a league,\nAnd, now the matter grows to compromise,\nStand'st thou aloof upon comparison?\nEither accept the title thou usurp'st,\nOf benefit proceeding from our king\nAnd not of any challenge of desert,\nOr we will plague thee with incessant wars.\nREIGNIER\nMy lord, you do not well in obstinacy\nTo cavil in the course of this contract:\nIf once it be neglected, ten to one\nWe shall not find like opportunity.\nALENCON\nTo say the truth, it is your policy\nTo save your subjects from such massacre\nAnd ruthless slaughters as are daily seen\nBy our proceeding in hostility;\nAnd therefore take this compact of a truce,\nAlthough you break it when your pleasure serves.\nWARWICK\nHow say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?\nCHARLES\nIt shall;\nOnly reserved, you claim no interest\nIn any of our towns of garrison.\nYORK\nThen swear allegiance to his majesty,\nAs thou art knight, never to disobey\nNor be rebellious to the crown of England,\nThou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.\nSo, now dismiss your army when ye please:\nHang up your ensign, let your drums be still,\nFor here we entertain a solemn peace.\nExeunt"

    "content":"SCENE V. London. The palace.\nEnter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER\nKING HENRY VI\nYour wondrous rare description, noble earl,\nOf beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:\nHer virtues graced with external gifts\nDo breed love's settled passions in my heart:\nAnd like as rigor of tempestuous gusts\nProvokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,\nSo am I driven by breath of her renown\nEither to suffer shipwreck or arrive\nWhere I may have fruition of her love.\nSUFFOLK\nTush, my good lord, this superficial tale\nIs but a preface of her worthy praise;\nThe chief perfections of that lovely dame\nHad I sufficient skill to utter them,\nWould make a volume of enticing lines,\nAble to ravish any dull conceit:\nAnd, which is more, she is not so divine,\nSo full-replete with choice of all delights,\nBut with as humble lowliness of mind\nShe is content to be at your command;\nCommand, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,\nTo love and honour Henry as her lord.\nKING HENRY VI\nAnd otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.\nTherefore, my lord protector, give consent\nThat Margaret may be England's royal queen.\nGLOUCESTER\nSo should I give consent to flatter sin.\nYou know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd\nUnto another lady of esteem:\nHow shall we then dispense with that contract,\nAnd not deface your honour with reproach?\nSUFFOLK\nAs doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;\nOr one that, at a triumph having vow'd\nTo try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists\nBy reason of his adversary's odds:\nA poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,\nAnd therefore may be broke without offence.\nGLOUCESTER\nWhy, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?\nHer father is no better than an earl,\nAlthough in glorious titles he excel.\nSUFFOLK\nYes, lord, her father is a king,\nThe King of Naples and Jerusalem;\nAnd of such great authority in France\nAs his alliance will confirm our peace\nAnd keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.\nGLOUCESTER\nAnd so the Earl of Armagnac may do,\nBecause he is near kinsman unto Charles.\nEXETER\nBeside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,\nWhere Reignier sooner will receive than give.\nSUFFOLK\nA dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,\nThat he should be so abject, base and poor,\nTo choose for wealth and not for perfect love.\nHenry is able to enrich his queen\nAnd not seek a queen to make him rich:\nSo worthless peasants bargain for their wives,\nAs market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.\nMarriage is a matter of more worth\nThan to be dealt in by attorneyship;\nNot whom we will, but whom his grace affects,\nMust be companion of his nuptial bed:\nAnd therefore, lords, since he affects her most,\nIt most of all these reasons bindeth us,\nIn our opinions she should be preferr'd.\nFor what is wedlock forced but a hell,\nAn age of discord and continual strife?\nWhereas the contrary bringeth bliss,\nAnd is a pattern of celestial peace.\nWhom should we match with Henry, being a king,\nBut Margaret, that is daughter to a king?\nHer peerless feature, joined with her birth,\nApproves her fit for none but for a king:\nHer valiant courage and undaunted spirit,\nMore than in women commonly is seen,\nWill answer our hope in issue of a king;\nFor Henry, son unto a conqueror,\nIs likely to beget more conquerors,\nIf with a lady of so high resolve\nAs is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.\nThen yield, my lords; and here conclude with me\nThat Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.\nKING HENRY VI\nWhether it be through force of your report,\nMy noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that\nMy tender youth was never yet attaint\nWith any passion of inflaming love,\nI cannot tell; but this I am assured,\nI feel such sharp dissension in my breast,\nSuch fierce alarums both of hope and fear,\nAs I am sick with working of my thoughts.\nTake, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;\nAgree to any covenants, and procure\nThat Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come\nTo cross the seas to England and be crown'd\nKing Henry's faithful and anointed queen:\nFor your expenses and sufficient charge,\nAmong the people gather up a tenth.\nBe gone, I say; for, till you do return,\nI rest perplexed with a thousand cares.\nAnd you, good uncle, banish all offence:\nIf you do censure me by what you were,\nNot what you are, I know it will excuse\nThis sudden execution of my will.\nAnd so, conduct me where, from company,\nI may revolve and ruminate my grief.\nExit\n\nGLOUCESTER\nAy, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.\nExeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER\n\nSUFFOLK\nThus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,\nAs did the youthful Paris once to Greece,\nWith hope to find the like event in love,\nBut prosper better than the Trojan did.\nMargaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;\nBut I will rule both her, the king and realm.\nExit",
