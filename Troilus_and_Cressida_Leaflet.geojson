    "content":"PROLOGUE\nIn Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece\nThe princes orgulous, their high blood chaf’d,\nHave to the port of Athens sent their ships\nFraught with the ministers and instruments\nOf cruel war. Sixty and nine that wore\nTheir crownets regal from the Athenian bay\nPut forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made\nTo ransack Troy, within whose strong immures\nThe ravish’d Helen, Menelaus’ queen,\nWith wanton Paris sleeps—and that’s the quarrel.\nTo Tenedos they come,\nAnd the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge\nTheir war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains\nThe fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch\nTheir brave pavilions: Priam’s six-gated city,\nDardan, and Tymbria, Ilias, Chetas, Troien,\nAnd Antenorides, with massy staples\nAnd corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,\nStir up the sons of Troy.\nNow expectation, tickling skittish spirits\nOn one and other side, Trojan and Greek,\nSets all on hazard. And hither am I come\nA prologue arm’d, but not in confidence\nOf author’s pen or actor’s voice, but suited\nIn like conditions as our argument,\nTo tell you, fair beholders, that our play\nLeaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,\nBeginning in the middle; starting thence away,\nTo what may be digested in a play.\nLike or find fault; do as your pleasures are;\nNow good or bad, ’tis but the chance of war.",

    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Troy. Before Priam’s palace.\nEnter Troilus armed, and Pandarus.\n\nTROILUS.\nCall here my varlet; I’ll unarm again.\nWhy should I war without the walls of Troy\nThat find such cruel battle here within?\nEach Trojan that is master of his heart,\nLet him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWill this gear ne’er be mended?\n\nTROILUS.\nThe Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,\nFierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;\nBut I am weaker than a woman’s tear,\nTamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,\nLess valiant than the virgin in the night,\nAnd skilless as unpractis’d infancy.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, I have told you enough of this; for my part, I’ll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.\n\nTROILUS.\nHave I not tarried?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.\n\nTROILUS.\nHave I not tarried?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.\n\nTROILUS.\nStill have I tarried.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, to the leavening; but here’s yet in the word ‘hereafter’ the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or you may chance burn your lips.\n\nTROILUS.\nPatience herself, what goddess e’er she be,\nDoth lesser blench at suff’rance than I do.\nAt Priam’s royal table do I sit;\nAnd when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,\nSo, traitor! ‘when she comes’! when she is thence?\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, she look’d yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look, or any woman else.\n\nTROILUS.\nI was about to tell thee: when my heart,\nAs wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,\nLest Hector or my father should perceive me,\nI have, as when the sun doth light a storm,\nBuried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.\nBut sorrow that is couch’d in seeming gladness\nIs like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAn her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen’s, well, go to, there were no more comparison between the women. But, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra’s wit; but—\n\nTROILUS.\nO Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,\nWhen I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown’d,\nReply not in how many fathoms deep\nThey lie indrench’d. I tell thee I am mad\nIn Cressid’s love. Thou answer’st ‘She is fair’;\nPour’st in the open ulcer of my heart\nHer eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,\nHandlest in thy discourse. O! that her hand,\nIn whose comparison all whites are ink\nWriting their own reproach; to whose soft seizure\nThe cygnet’s down is harsh, and spirit of sense\nHard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell’st me,\nAs true thou tell’st me, when I say I love her;\nBut, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,\nThou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me\nThe knife that made it.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI speak no more than truth.\n\nTROILUS.\nThou dost not speak so much.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFaith, I’ll not meddle in’t. Let her be as she is: if she be fair, ’tis the better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.\n\nTROILUS.\nGood Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!\n\nPANDARUS.\nI have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labour.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat! art thou angry, Pandarus? What! with me?\n\nPANDARUS.\nBecause she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not so fair as Helen. And she were not kin to me, she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor; ’tis all one to me.\n\nTROILUS.\nSay I she is not fair?\n\nPANDARUS.\nI do not care whether you do or no. She’s a fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks; and so I’ll tell her the next time I see her. For my part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ the matter.\n\nTROILUS.\nPandarus—\n\nPANDARUS.\nNot I.\n\nTROILUS.\nSweet Pandarus—\n\nPANDARUS.\nPray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I found it, and there an end.\n\n[Exit Pandarus. An alarum.]\n\nTROILUS.\nPeace, you ungracious clamours! Peace, rude sounds!\nFools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,\nWhen with your blood you daily paint her thus.\nI cannot fight upon this argument;\nIt is too starv’d a subject for my sword.\nBut Pandarus, O gods! how do you plague me!\nI cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;\nAnd he’s as tetchy to be woo’d to woo\nAs she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.\nTell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne’s love,\nWhat Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?\nHer bed is India; there she lies, a pearl;\nBetween our Ilium and where she resides\nLet it be call’d the wild and wandering flood;\nOurself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar\nOur doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.\n\nAlarum. Enter Aeneas.\n\nAENEAS.\nHow now, Prince Troilus! Wherefore not afield?\n\nTROILUS.\nBecause not there. This woman’s answer sorts,\nFor womanish it is to be from thence.\nWhat news, Aeneas, from the field today?\n\nAENEAS.\nThat Paris is returned home, and hurt.\n\nTROILUS.\nBy whom, Aeneas?\n\nAENEAS.\nTroilus, by Menelaus.\n\nTROILUS.\nLet Paris bleed: ’tis but a scar to scorn;\nParis is gor’d with Menelaus’ horn.\n\n[Alarum.]\n\nAENEAS.\nHark what good sport is out of town today!\n\nTROILUS.\nBetter at home, if ‘would I might’ were ‘may.’\nBut to the sport abroad. Are you bound thither?\n\nAENEAS.\nIn all swift haste.\n\nTROILUS.\nCome, go we then together.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A street.\nEnter Cressida and her man Alexander.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho were those went by?\n\nALEXANDER.\nQueen Hecuba and Helen.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd whither go they?\n\nALEXANDER.\nUp to the eastern tower,\nWhose height commands as subject all the vale,\nTo see the battle. Hector, whose patience\nIs as a virtue fix’d, today was mov’d.\nHe chid Andromache, and struck his armourer;\nAnd, like as there were husbandry in war,\nBefore the sun rose he was harness’d light,\nAnd to the field goes he; where every flower\nDid as a prophet weep what it foresaw\nIn Hector’s wrath.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat was his cause of anger?\n\nALEXANDER.\nThe noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks\nA lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;\nThey call him Ajax.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nGood; and what of him?\n\nALEXANDER.\nThey say he is a very man per se\nAnd stands alone.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.\n\nALEXANDER.\nThis man, lady, hath robb’d many beasts of their particular additions: he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant—a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crush’d into folly, his folly sauced with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it; he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair; he hath the joints of everything; but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBut how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?\n\nALEXANDER.\nThey say he yesterday cop’d Hector in the battle and struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.\n\nEnter Pandarus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho comes here?\n\nALEXANDER.\nMadam, your uncle Pandarus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHector’s a gallant man.\n\nALEXANDER.\nAs may be in the world, lady.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat’s that? What’s that?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nGood morrow, uncle Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nGood morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?—Good morrow, Alexander.—How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThis morning, uncle.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm’d and gone ere you came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHector was gone; but Helen was not up.\n\nPANDARUS.\nE’en so. Hector was stirring early.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThat were we talking of, and of his anger.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWas he angry?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo he says here.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTrue, he was so; I know the cause too; he’ll lay about him today, I can tell them that. And there’s Troilus will not come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat, is he angry too?\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO Jupiter! there’s no comparison.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAy, if I ever saw him before and knew him.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, I say Troilus is Troilus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThen you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNo, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.\n\nCRESSIDA.\n’Tis just to each of them: he is himself.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHimself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo he is.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCondition I had gone barefoot to India.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHe is not Hector.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHimself! no, he’s not himself. Would a’ were himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well! I would my heart were in her body! No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nExcuse me.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHe is elder.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPardon me, pardon me.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTh’other’s not come to’t; you shall tell me another tale when th’other’s come to’t. Hector shall not have his wit this year.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHe shall not need it if he have his own.\n\nANDARUS.\nNor his qualities.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNo matter.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNor his beauty.\n\nCRESSIDA.\n’Twould not become him: his own’s better.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou have no judgement, niece. Helen herself swore th’other day that Troilus, for a brown favour, for so ’tis, I must confess—not brown neither—\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNo, but brown.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFaith, to say truth, brown and not brown.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nTo say the truth, true and not true.\n\nPANDARUS.\nShe prais’d his complexion above Paris.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhy, Paris hath colour enough.\n\nPANDARUS.\nSo he has.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThen Troilus should have too much. If she prais’d him above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief Helen’s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThen she’s a merry Greek indeed.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNay, I am sure she does. She came to him th’other day into the compass’d window—and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin—\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIndeed a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhy, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIs he so young a man and so old a lifter?\n\nPANDARUS.\nBut to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin—\n\nCRESSIDA.\nJuno have mercy! How came it cloven?\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhy, you know, ’tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO, he smiles valiantly!\n\nPANDARUS.\nDoes he not?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO yes, an ’twere a cloud in autumn!\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhy, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus—\n\nCRESSIDA.\nTroilus will stand to the proof, if you’ll prove it so.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTroilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIf you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would eat chickens i’ th’ shell.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed, she has a marvell’s white hand, I must needs confess.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWithout the rack.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAnd she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAlas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.\n\nPANDARUS.\nBut there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh’d that her eyes ran o’er.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWith millstones.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAnd Cassandra laugh’d.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBut there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o’er too?\n\nPANDARUS.\nAnd Hector laugh’d.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAt what was all this laughing?\n\nPANDARUS.\nMarry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus’ chin.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd’t had been a green hair I should have laugh’d too.\n\nPANDARUS.\nThey laugh’d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat was his answer?\n\nPANDARUS.\nQuoth she ‘Here’s but two and fifty hairs on your chin, and one of them is white.’\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThis is her question.\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat’s true; make no question of that. ‘Two and fifty hairs,’ quoth he ‘and one white. That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.’ ‘Jupiter!’ quoth she ‘which of these hairs is Paris my husband?’ ‘The forked one,’ quoth he, ’pluck’t out and give it him.’ But there was such laughing! and Helen so blush’d, and Paris so chaf’d; and all the rest so laugh’d that it pass’d.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo let it now; for it has been a great while going by.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on’t.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSo I do.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI’ll be sworn ’tis true; he will weep you, and ’twere a man born in April.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAnd I’ll spring up in his tears, an ’twere a nettle against May.\n\n[Sound a retreat.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nHark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up here and see them as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAt your pleasure.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHere, here, here’s an excellent place; here we may see most bravely. I’ll tell you them all by their names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.\n\n[Aeneas passes.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSpeak not so loud.\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat’s Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He’s one of the flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark Troilus; you shall see anon.\n\n[Antenor passes.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho’s that?\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat’s Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and he’s a man good enough; he’s one o’ th’ soundest judgements in Troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. When comes Troilus? I’ll show you Troilus anon. If he see me, you shall see him nod at me.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWill he give you the nod?\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou shall see.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIf he do, the rich shall have more.\n\n[Hector passes.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat’s Hector, that, that, look you, that; there’s a fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There’s a brave man, niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks. There’s a countenance! Is’t not a brave man?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nO, a brave man!\n\nPANDARUS.\nIs a’ not? It does a man’s heart good. Look you what hacks are on his helmet! Look you yonder, do you see? Look you there. There’s no jesting; there’s laying on; take’t off who will, as they say. There be hacks.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBe those with swords?\n\nPANDARUS.\nSwords! anything, he cares not; and the devil come to him, it’s all one. By God’s lid, it does one’s heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.\n\n[Paris passes.]\n\nLook ye yonder, niece; is’t not a gallant man too, is’t not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came hurt home today? He’s not hurt. Why, this will do Helen’s heart good now, ha! Would I could see Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.\n\n[Helenus passes.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWho’s that?\n\nPANDARUS.\nThat’s Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That’s\nHelenus. I think he went not forth today. That’s Helenus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nCan Helenus fight, uncle?\n\nPANDARUS.\nHelenus! no. Yes, he’ll fight indifferent well. I marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the people cry ‘Troilus’?—Helenus is a priest.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWhat sneaking fellow comes yonder?\n\n[Troilus passes.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhere? yonder? That’s Deiphobus. ’Tis Troilus. There’s a man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPeace, for shame, peace!\n\nPANDARUS.\nMark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him, niece; look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more hack’d than Hector’s; and how he looks, and how he goes! O admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way. Had I a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to change, would give an eye to boot.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHere comes more.\n\n[Common soldiers pass.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nAsses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran! porridge after meat! I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus. Ne’er look, ne’er look; the eagles are gone. Crows and daws, crows and daws! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThere is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAchilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWell, well.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWell, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAy, a minc’d man; and then to be bak’d with no date in the pie, for then the man’s date is out.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you lie.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nUpon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to defend all these; and at all these wards I lie, at a thousand watches.\n\nPANDARUS.\nSay one of your watches.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNay, I’ll watch you for that; and that’s one of the chiefest of them too. If I cannot ward what I would not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it’s past watching.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou are such another!\n\nEnter Troilus' Boy.\n\nBOY.\nSir, my lord would instantly speak with you.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhere?\n\nBOY.\nAt your own house; there he unarms him.\n\nPANDARUS.\nGood boy, tell him I come. [Exit Boy.] I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAdieu, uncle.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI will be with you, niece, by and by.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nTo bring, uncle.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, a token from Troilus.\n\n[Exit Pandarus.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBy the same token, you are a bawd.\nWords, vows, gifts, tears, and love’s full sacrifice,\nHe offers in another’s enterprise;\nBut more in Troilus thousand-fold I see\nThan in the glass of Pandar’s praise may be,\nYet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:\nThings won are done; joy’s soul lies in the doing.\nThat she belov’d knows naught that knows not this:\nMen prize the thing ungain’d more than it is.\nThat she was never yet that ever knew\nLove got so sweet as when desire did sue;\nTherefore this maxim out of love I teach:\n‘Achievement is command; ungain’d, beseech.’\nThen though my heart’s content firm love doth bear,\nNothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.\n\n[Exit.]",

The sea being smooth,\nHow many shallow bauble boats dare sail\nUpon her patient breast, making their way\nWith those of nobler bulk!\nBut let the ruffian Boreas once enrage\nThe gentle Thetis, and anon behold\nThe strong-ribb’d bark through liquid mountains cut,\nBounding between the two moist elements\nLike Perseus’ horse. Where’s then the saucy boat,\nWhose weak untimber’d sides but even now\nCo-rivall’d greatness? Either to harbour fled\nOr made a toast for Neptune. Even so\nDoth valour’s show and valour’s worth divide\nIn storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness\nThe herd hath more annoyance by the breeze\nThan by the tiger; but when the splitting wind\nMakes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,\nAnd flies fled under shade—why, then the thing of courage,\nAs rous’d with rage, with rage doth sympathise,\nAnd with an accent tun’d in self-same key\nRetorts to chiding fortune.\n\nULYSSES.\nAgamemnon,\nThou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,\nHeart of our numbers, soul and only spirit\nIn whom the tempers and the minds of all\nShould be shut up—hear what Ulysses speaks.\nBesides th’applause and approbation\nThe which, [To Agamemnon] most mighty, for thy place and sway,\n[To Nestor] And, thou most reverend, for thy stretch’d-out life,\nI give to both your speeches—which were such\nAs Agamemnon and the hand of Greece\nShould hold up high in brass; and such again\nAs venerable Nestor, hatch’d in silver,\nShould with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree\nOn which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears\nTo his experienc’d tongue—yet let it please both,\nThou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nSpeak, Prince of Ithaca; and be’t of less expect\nThat matter needless, of importless burden,\nDivide thy lips than we are confident,\nWhen rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,\nWe shall hear music, wit, and oracle.\n\nULYSSES.\nTroy, yet upon his basis, had been down,\nAnd the great Hector’s sword had lack’d a master,\nBut for these instances:\nThe specialty of rule hath been neglected;\nAnd look how many Grecian tents do stand\nHollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.\nWhen that the general is not like the hive,\nTo whom the foragers shall all repair,\nWhat honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,\nTh’unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.\nThe heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,\nObserve degree, priority, and place,\nInsisture, course, proportion, season, form,\nOffice, and custom, in all line of order;\nAnd therefore is the glorious planet Sol\nIn noble eminence enthron’d and spher’d\nAmidst the other, whose med’cinable eye\nCorrects the influence of evil planets,\nAnd posts, like the commandment of a king,\nSans check, to good and bad. But when the planets\nIn evil mixture to disorder wander,\nWhat plagues and what portents, what mutiny,\nWhat raging of the sea, shaking of earth,\nCommotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,\nDivert and crack, rend and deracinate,\nThe unity and married calm of states\nQuite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak’d,\nWhich is the ladder of all high designs,\nThe enterprise is sick! How could communities,\nDegrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,\nPeaceful commerce from dividable shores,\nThe primogenity and due of birth,\nPrerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,\nBut by degree stand in authentic place?\nTake but degree away, untune that string,\nAnd hark what discord follows! Each thing melts\nIn mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters\nShould lift their bosoms higher than the shores,\nAnd make a sop of all this solid globe;\nStrength should be lord of imbecility,\nAnd the rude son should strike his father dead;\nForce should be right; or, rather, right and wrong—\nBetween whose endless jar justice resides—\nShould lose their names, and so should justice too.\nThen everything includes itself in power,\nPower into will, will into appetite;\nAnd appetite, an universal wolf,\nSo doubly seconded with will and power,\nMust make perforce an universal prey,\nAnd last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\nThis chaos, when degree is suffocate,\nFollows the choking.\nAnd this neglection of degree it is\nThat by a pace goes backward, with a purpose\nIt hath to climb. The general’s disdain’d\nBy him one step below, he by the next,\nThat next by him beneath; so every step,\nExampl’d by the first pace that is sick\nOf his superior, grows to an envious fever\nOf pale and bloodless emulation.\nAnd ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,\nNot her own sinews. To end a tale of length,\nTroy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.\n\nNESTOR.\nMost wisely hath Ulysses here discover’d\nThe fever whereof all our power is sick.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThe nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,\nWhat is the remedy?\n\nULYSSES.\nThe great Achilles, whom opinion crowns\nThe sinew and the forehand of our host,\nHaving his ear full of his airy fame,\nGrows dainty of his worth, and in his tent\nLies mocking our designs; with him Patroclus\nUpon a lazy bed the livelong day\nBreaks scurril jests;\nAnd with ridiculous and awkward action—\nWhich, slanderer, he imitation calls—\nHe pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,\nThy topless deputation he puts on;\nAnd like a strutting player whose conceit\nLies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich\nTo hear the wooden dialogue and sound\n’Twixt his stretch’d footing and the scaffoldage—\nSuch to-be-pitied and o’er-wrested seeming\nHe acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks\n’Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar’d,\nWhich, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp’d,\nWould seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff\nThe large Achilles, on his press’d bed lolling,\nFrom his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;\nCries ‘Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right!\nNow play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,\nAs he being drest to some oration.’\nThat’s done—as near as the extremest ends\nOf parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;\nYet god Achilles still cries ‘Excellent!\n’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,\nArming to answer in a night alarm.’\nAnd then, forsooth, the faint defects of age\nMust be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit\nAnd, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,\nShake in and out the rivet. And at this sport\nSir Valour dies; cries ‘O, enough, Patroclus;\nOr give me ribs of steel! I shall split all\nIn pleasure of my spleen.’ And in this fashion\nAll our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,\nSeverals and generals of grace exact,\nAchievements, plots, orders, preventions,\nExcitements to the field or speech for truce,\nSuccess or loss, what is or is not, serves\nAs stuff for these two to make paradoxes.\n\nNESTOR.\nAnd in the imitation of these twain—\nWho, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns\nWith an imperial voice—many are infect.\nAjax is grown self-will’d and bears his head\nIn such a rein, in full as proud a place\nAs broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;\nMakes factious feasts; rails on our state of war\nBold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,\nA slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,\nTo match us in comparisons with dirt,\nTo weaken and discredit our exposure,\nHow rank soever rounded in with danger.\n\nULYSSES.\nThey tax our policy and call it cowardice,\nCount wisdom as no member of the war,\nForestall prescience, and esteem no act\nBut that of hand. The still and mental parts\nThat do contrive how many hands shall strike\nWhen fitness calls them on, and know, by measure\nOf their observant toil, the enemies’ weight—\nWhy, this hath not a finger’s dignity:\nThey call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet-war;\nSo that the ram that batters down the wall,\nFor the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,\nThey place before his hand that made the engine,\nOr those that with the fineness of their souls\nBy reason guide his execution.\n\nNESTOR.\nLet this be granted, and Achilles’ horse\nMakes many Thetis’ sons.\n\n[Tucket.]\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat trumpet? Look, Menelaus.\n\nMENELAUS.\nFrom Troy.\n\nEnter Aeneas.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat would you fore our tent?\n\nAENEAS.\nIs this great Agamemnon’s tent, I pray you?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nEven this.\n\nAENEAS.\nMay one that is a herald and a prince\nDo a fair message to his kingly eyes?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWith surety stronger than Achilles’ arm\nFore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice\nCall Agamemnon head and general.\n\nAENEAS.\nFair leave and large security. How may\nA stranger to those most imperial looks\nKnow them from eyes of other mortals?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nHow?\n\nAENEAS.\nAy;\nI ask, that I might waken reverence,\nAnd bid the cheek be ready with a blush\nModest as morning when she coldly eyes\nThe youthful Phoebus.\nWhich is that god in office, guiding men?\nWhich is the high and mighty Agamemnon?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThis Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy\nAre ceremonious courtiers.\n\nAENEAS.\nCourtiers as free, as debonair, unarm’d,\nAs bending angels; that’s their fame in peace.\nBut when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,\nGood arms, strong joints, true swords; and, Jove’s accord,\nNothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,\nPeace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips.\nThe worthiness of praise distains his worth,\nIf that the prais’d himself bring the praise forth;\nBut what the repining enemy commends,\nThat breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nSir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?\n\nAENEAS.\nAy, Greek, that is my name.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat’s your affairs, I pray you?\n\nAENEAS.\nSir, pardon; ’tis for Agamemnon’s ears.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHe hears naught privately that comes from Troy.\n\nAENEAS.\nNor I from Troy come not to whisper with him;\nI bring a trumpet to awake his ear,\nTo set his sense on the attentive bent,\nAnd then to speak.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nSpeak frankly as the wind;\nIt is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour.\nThat thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,\nHe tells thee so himself.\n\nAENEAS.\nTrumpet, blow loud,\nSend thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;\nAnd every Greek of mettle, let him know\nWhat Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.\n\n[Sound trumpet.]\n\nWe have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy\nA prince called Hector—Priam is his father—\nWho in this dull and long-continued truce\nIs resty grown; he bade me take a trumpet\nAnd to this purpose speak: Kings, princes, lords!\nIf there be one among the fair’st of Greece\nThat holds his honour higher than his ease,\nThat feeds his praise more than he fears his peril,\nThat knows his valour and knows not his fear,\nThat loves his mistress more than in confession\nWith truant vows to her own lips he loves,\nAnd dare avow her beauty and her worth\nIn other arms than hers—to him this challenge.\nHector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,\nShall make it good or do his best to do it:\nHe hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer,\nThan ever Greek did couple in his arms;\nAnd will tomorrow with his trumpet call\nMid-way between your tents and walls of Troy\nTo rouse a Grecian that is true in love.\nIf any come, Hector shall honour him;\nIf none, he’ll say in Troy, when he retires,\nThe Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth\nThe splinter of a lance. Even so much.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThis shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.\nIf none of them have soul in such a kind,\nWe left them all at home. But we are soldiers;\nAnd may that soldier a mere recreant prove\nThat means not, hath not, or is not in love.\nIf then one is, or hath, or means to be,\nThat one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.\n\nNESTOR.\nTell him of Nestor, one that was a man\nWhen Hector’s grandsire suck’d. He is old now;\nBut if there be not in our Grecian host\nA noble man that hath one spark of fire\nTo answer for his love, tell him from me\nI’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,\nAnd in my vambrace put this wither’d brawns,\nAnd meeting him, will tell him that my lady\nWas fairer than his grandam, and as chaste\nAs may be in the world. His youth in flood,\nI’ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.\n\nAENEAS.\nNow heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!\n\nULYSSES.\nAmen.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nFair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;\nTo our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.\nAchilles shall have word of this intent;\nSo shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.\nYourself shall feast with us before you go,\nAnd find the welcome of a noble foe.\n\n[Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor.]\n\nULYSSES.\nNestor!\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat says Ulysses?\n\nULYSSES.\nI have a young conception in my brain;\nBe you my time to bring it to some shape.\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat is’t?\n\nULYSSES.\nThis ’tis:\nBlunt wedges rive hard knots. The seeded pride\nThat hath to this maturity blown up\nIn rank Achilles must or now be cropp’d\nOr, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil\nTo overbulk us all.\n\nNESTOR.\nWell, and how?\n\nULYSSES.\nThis challenge that the gallant Hector sends,\nHowever it is spread in general name,\nRelates in purpose only to Achilles.\n\nNESTOR.\nTrue. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance\nWhose grossness little characters sum up;\nAnd, in the publication, make no strain\nBut that Achilles, were his brain as barren\nAs banks of Libya—though, Apollo knows,\n’Tis dry enough—will with great speed of judgement,\nAy, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose\nPointing on him.\n\nULYSSES.\nAnd wake him to the answer, think you?\n\nNESTOR.\nWhy, ’tis most meet. Who may you else oppose\nThat can from Hector bring those honours off,\nIf not Achilles? Though ’t be a sportful combat,\nYet in this trial much opinion dwells\nFor here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute\nWith their fin’st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,\nOur imputation shall be oddly pois’d\nIn this vile action; for the success,\nAlthough particular, shall give a scantling\nOf good or bad unto the general;\nAnd in such indexes, although small pricks\nTo their subsequent volumes, there is seen\nThe baby figure of the giant mass\nOf things to come at large. It is suppos’d\nHe that meets Hector issues from our choice;\nAnd choice, being mutual act of all our souls,\nMakes merit her election, and doth boil,\nAs ’twere from forth us all, a man distill’d\nOut of our virtues; who miscarrying,\nWhat heart receives from hence a conquering part,\nTo steel a strong opinion to themselves?\nWhich entertain’d, limbs are his instruments,\nIn no less working than are swords and bows\nDirective by the limbs.\n\nULYSSES.\nGive pardon to my speech. Therefore ’tis meet\nAchilles meet not Hector. Let us, like merchants,\nFirst show foul wares, and think perchance they’ll sell;\nIf not, the lustre of the better shall exceed\nBy showing the worse first. Do not consent\nThat ever Hector and Achilles meet;\nFor both our honour and our shame in this\nAre dogg’d with two strange followers.\n\nNESTOR.\nI see them not with my old eyes. What are they?\n\nULYSSES.\nWhat glory our Achilles shares from Hector,\nWere he not proud, we all should share with him;\nBut he already is too insolent;\nAnd it were better parch in Afric sun\nThan in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,\nShould he scape Hector fair. If he were foil’d,\nWhy, then we do our main opinion crush\nIn taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry;\nAnd, by device, let blockish Ajax draw\nThe sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves\nGive him allowance for the better man;\nFor that will physic the great Myrmidon,\nWho broils in loud applause, and make him fall\nHis crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.\nIf the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,\nWe’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,\nYet go we under our opinion still\nThat we have better men. But, hit or miss,\nOur project’s life this shape of sense assumes—\nAjax employ’d plucks down Achilles’ plumes.\n\nNESTOR.\nNow, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice;\nAnd I will give a taste thereof forthwith\nTo Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.\nTwo curs shall tame each other: pride alone\nMust tarre the mastiffs on, as ’twere their bone.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Troy. Priam’s palace.\nEnter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenus.\n\nPRIAM.\nAfter so many hours, lives, speeches spent,\nThus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:\n‘Deliver Helen, and all damage else—\nAs honour, loss of time, travail, expense,\nWounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum’d\nIn hot digestion of this cormorant war—\nShall be struck off.’ Hector, what say you to’t?\n\nHECTOR.\nThough no man lesser fears the Greeks than I,\nAs far as toucheth my particular,\nYet, dread Priam,\nThere is no lady of more softer bowels,\nMore spongy to suck in the sense of fear,\nMore ready to cry out ‘Who knows what follows?’\nThan Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,\nSurety secure; but modest doubt is call’d\nThe beacon of the wise, the tent that searches\nTo th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.\nSince the first sword was drawn about this question,\nEvery tithe soul ’mongst many thousand dismes\nHath been as dear as Helen—I mean, of ours.\nIf we have lost so many tenths of ours\nTo guard a thing not ours, nor worth to us,\nHad it our name, the value of one ten,\nWhat merit’s in that reason which denies\nThe yielding of her up?\n\nTROILUS.\nFie, fie, my brother!\nWeigh you the worth and honour of a king,\nSo great as our dread father’s, in a scale\nOf common ounces? Will you with counters sum\nThe past-proportion of his infinite,\nAnd buckle in a waist most fathomless\nWith spans and inches so diminutive\nAs fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!\n\nHELENUS.\nNo marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons,\nYou are so empty of them. Should not our father\nBear the great sway of his affairs with reason,\nBecause your speech hath none that tells him so?\n\nTROILUS.\nYou are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;\nYou fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:\nYou know an enemy intends you harm;\nYou know a sword employ’d is perilous,\nAnd reason flies the object of all harm.\nWho marvels, then, when Helenus beholds\nA Grecian and his sword, if he do set\nThe very wings of reason to his heels\nAnd fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,\nOr like a star disorb’d? Nay, if we talk of reason,\nLet’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honour\nShould have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts\nWith this cramm’d reason. Reason and respect\nMake livers pale and lustihood deject.\n\nHECTOR.\nBrother, she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat’s aught but as ’tis valued?\n\nHECTOR.\nBut value dwells not in particular will:\nIt holds his estimate and dignity\nAs well wherein ’tis precious of itself\nAs in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry\nTo make the service greater than the god,\nAnd the will dotes that is attributive\nTo what infectiously itself affects,\nWithout some image of th’affected merit.\n\nTROILUS.\nI take today a wife, and my election\nIs led on in the conduct of my will;\nMy will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,\nTwo traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores\nOf will and judgement: how may I avoid,\nAlthough my will distaste what it elected,\nThe wife I chose? There can be no evasion\nTo blench from this and to stand firm by honour.\nWe turn not back the silks upon the merchant\nWhen we have soil’d them; nor the remainder viands\nWe do not throw in unrespective sieve,\nBecause we now are full. It was thought meet\nParis should do some vengeance on the Greeks;\nYour breath with full consent bellied his sails;\nThe seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,\nAnd did him service. He touch’d the ports desir’d;\nAnd for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive\nHe brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness\nWrinkles Apollo’s, and makes stale the morning.\nWhy keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.\nIs she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl\nWhose price hath launch’d above a thousand ships,\nAnd turn’d crown’d kings to merchants.\nIf you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went—\nAs you must needs, for you all cried ‘Go, go’—\nIf you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize—\nAs you must needs, for you all clapp’d your hands,\nAnd cried ‘Inestimable!’—why do you now\nThe issue of your proper wisdoms rate,\nAnd do a deed that never Fortune did—\nBeggar the estimation which you priz’d\nRicher than sea and land? O theft most base,\nThat we have stol’n what we do fear to keep!\nBut thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n\nThat in their country did them that disgrace\nWe fear to warrant in our native place!\n\nCASSANDRA.\n[Within.] Cry, Trojans, cry.\n\nPRIAM.\nWhat noise, what shriek is this?\n\nTROILUS.\n’Tis our mad sister; I do know her voice.\n\nCASSANDRA.\n[Within.] Cry, Trojans.\n\nHECTOR.\nIt is Cassandra.\n\nEnter Cassandra, raving.\n\nCASSANDRA.\nCry, Trojans, cry. Lend me ten thousand eyes,\nAnd I will fill them with prophetic tears.\n\nHECTOR.\nPeace, sister, peace.\n\nCASSANDRA.\nVirgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,\nSoft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,\nAdd to my clamours. Let us pay betimes\nA moiety of that mass of moan to come.\nCry, Trojans, cry. Practise your eyes with tears.\nTroy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;\nOur firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.\nCry, Trojans, cry, A Helen and a woe!\nCry, cry. Troy burns, or else let Helen go.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nHECTOR.\nNow, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains\nOf divination in our sister work\nSome touches of remorse? Or is your blood\nSo madly hot, that no discourse of reason,\nNor fear of bad success in a bad cause,\nCan qualify the same?\n\nTROILUS.\nWhy, brother Hector,\nWe may not think the justness of each act\nSuch and no other than event doth form it;\nNor once deject the courage of our minds\nBecause Cassandra’s mad. Her brain-sick raptures\nCannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel\nWhich hath our several honours all engag’d\nTo make it gracious. For my private part,\nI am no more touch’d than all Priam’s sons;\nAnd Jove forbid there should be done amongst us\nSuch things as might offend the weakest spleen\nTo fight for and maintain.\n\nPARIS.\nElse might the world convince of levity\nAs well my undertakings as your counsels;\nBut I attest the gods, your full consent\nGave wings to my propension, and cut off\nAll fears attending on so dire a project.\nFor what, alas, can these my single arms?\nWhat propugnation is in one man’s valour\nTo stand the push and enmity of those\nThis quarrel would excite? Yet I protest,\nWere I alone to pass the difficulties,\nAnd had as ample power as I have will,\nParis should ne’er retract what he hath done,\nNor faint in the pursuit.\n\nPRIAM.\nParis, you speak\nLike one besotted on your sweet delights.\nYou have the honey still, but these the gall;\nSo to be valiant is no praise at all.\n\nPARIS.\nSir, I propose not merely to myself\nThe pleasures such a beauty brings with it;\nBut I would have the soil of her fair rape\nWip’d off in honourable keeping her.\nWhat treason were it to the ransack’d queen,\nDisgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,\nNow to deliver her possession up\nOn terms of base compulsion! Can it be,\nThat so degenerate a strain as this\nShould once set footing in your generous bosoms?\nThere’s not the meanest spirit on our party\nWithout a heart to dare or sword to draw\nWhen Helen is defended; nor none so noble\nWhose life were ill bestow’d or death unfam’d,\nWhere Helen is the subject. Then, I say,\nWell may we fight for her whom we know well\nThe world’s large spaces cannot parallel.\n\nHECTOR.\nParis and Troilus, you have both said well;\nAnd on the cause and question now in hand\nHave gloz’d, but superficially; not much\nUnlike young men, whom Aristotle thought\nUnfit to hear moral philosophy.\nThe reasons you allege do more conduce\nTo the hot passion of distemp’red blood\nThan to make up a free determination\n’Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge\nHave ears more deaf than adders to the voice\nOf any true decision. Nature craves\nAll dues be rend’red to their owners. Now,\nWhat nearer debt in all humanity\nThan wife is to the husband? If this law\nOf nature be corrupted through affection;\nAnd that great minds, of partial indulgence\nTo their benumbed wills, resist the same;\nThere is a law in each well-order’d nation\nTo curb those raging appetites that are\nMost disobedient and refractory.\nIf Helen, then, be wife to Sparta’s king—\nAs it is known she is—these moral laws\nOf nature and of nations speak aloud\nTo have her back return’d. Thus to persist\nIn doing wrong extenuates not wrong,\nBut makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion\nIs this, in way of truth. Yet, ne’ertheless,\nMy spritely brethren, I propend to you\nIn resolution to keep Helen still;\nFor ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependence\nUpon our joint and several dignities.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhy, there you touch’d the life of our design.\nWere it not glory that we more affected\nThan the performance of our heaving spleens,\nI would not wish a drop of Trojan blood\nSpent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,\nShe is a theme of honour and renown,\nA spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,\nWhose present courage may beat down our foes,\nAnd fame in time to come canonize us;\nFor I presume brave Hector would not lose\nSo rich advantage of a promis’d glory\nAs smiles upon the forehead of this action\nFor the wide world’s revenue.\n\nHECTOR.\nI am yours,\nYou valiant offspring of great Priamus.\nI have a roisting challenge sent amongst\nThe dull and factious nobles of the Greeks\nWill strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.\nI was advertis’d their great general slept,\nWhilst emulation in the army crept.\nThis, I presume, will wake him.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before the tent of Achilles.\nEnter Thersites, solus.\n\nTHERSITES.\nHow now, Thersites! What, lost in the labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O worthy satisfaction! Would it were otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he rail’d at me! ‘Sfoot, I’ll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I’ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a rare engineer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have! which short-arm’d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! or, rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the curse depending on those that war for a placket. I have said my prayers; and devil Envy say ‘Amen.’ What ho! my Lord Achilles!\n\nEnter Patroclus.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWho’s there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.\n\nTHERSITES.\nIf I could a’ rememb’red a gilt counterfeit, thou wouldst not have slipp’d out of my contemplation; but it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death. Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I’ll be sworn and sworn upon’t she never shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where’s Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhat, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?\n\nTHERSITES.\nAy, the heavens hear me!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAmen.\n\nEnter Achilles.\n\nACHILLES.\nWho’s there?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThersites, my lord.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhere, where? O, where? Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals? Come, what’s Agamemnon?\n\nTHERSITES.\nThy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus, what’s Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what’s Thersites?\n\nTHERSITES.\nThy knower, Patroclus. Then tell me, Patroclus, what art thou?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThou must tell that knowest.\n\nACHILLES.\nO, tell, tell,\n\nTHERSITES.\nI’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus’ knower; and Patroclus is a fool.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nYou rascal!\n\nTHERSITES.\nPeace, fool! I have not done.\n\nACHILLES.\nHe is a privileg’d man. Proceed, Thersites.\n\nTHERSITES.\nAgamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites is a fool; and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.\n\nACHILLES.\nDerive this; come.\n\nTHERSITES.\nAgamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles; Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon; Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool; and this Patroclus is a fool positive.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhy am I a fool?\n\nTHERSITES.\nMake that demand of the Creator. It suffices me thou art. Look you, who comes here?\n\nEnter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Diomedes, Ajax and Calchas.\n\nACHILLES.\nCome, Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody. Come in with me, Thersites.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTHERSITES.\nHere is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery. All the argument is a whore and a cuckold—a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on the subject, and war and lechery confound all!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhere is Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWithin his tent; but ill-dispos’d, my lord.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nLet it be known to him that we are here.\nHe shent our messengers; and we lay by\nOur appertainings, visiting of him.\nLet him be told so; lest, perchance, he think\nWe dare not move the question of our place\nOr know not what we are.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nI shall say so to him.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nULYSSES.\nWe saw him at the opening of his tent.\nHe is not sick.\n\nAJAX.\nYes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my head, ’tis pride. But why, why? Let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.\n\n[Takes Agamemnon aside.]\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat moves Ajax thus to bay at him?\n\nULYSSES.\nAchilles hath inveigled his fool from him.\n\nNESTOR.\nWho, Thersites?\n\nULYSSES.\nHe.\n\nNESTOR.\nThen will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.\n\nULYSSES.\nNo; you see he is his argument that has his argument, Achilles.\n\nNESTOR.\nAll the better; their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite!\n\nULYSSES.\nThe amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.\n\nRe-enter Patroclus.\n\nHere comes Patroclus.\n\nNESTOR.\nNo Achilles with him.\n\nULYSSES.\nThe elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAchilles bids me say he is much sorry\nIf any thing more than your sport and pleasure\nDid move your greatness and this noble state\nTo call upon him; he hopes it is no other\nBut for your health and your digestion sake,\nAn after-dinner’s breath.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nHear you, Patroclus.\nWe are too well acquainted with these answers;\nBut his evasion, wing’d thus swift with scorn,\nCannot outfly our apprehensions.\nMuch attribute he hath, and much the reason\nWhy we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,\nNot virtuously on his own part beheld,\nDo in our eyes begin to lose their gloss;\nYea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,\nAre like to rot untasted. Go and tell him\nWe come to speak with him; and you shall not sin\nIf you do say we think him over-proud\nAnd under-honest, in self-assumption greater\nThan in the note of judgement; and worthier than himself\nHere tend the savage strangeness he puts on,\nDisguise the holy strength of their command,\nAnd underwrite in an observing kind\nHis humorous predominance; yea, watch\nHis course and time, his ebbs and flows, as if\nThe passage and whole stream of this commencement\nRode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add\nThat if he overhold his price so much\nWe’ll none of him, but let him, like an engine\nNot portable, lie under this report:\nBring action hither; this cannot go to war.\nA stirring dwarf we do allowance give\nBefore a sleeping giant. Tell him so.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nI shall, and bring his answer presently.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nIn second voice we’ll not be satisfied;\nWe come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.\n\n[Exit Ulysses.]\n\nAJAX.\nWhat is he more than another?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nNo more than what he thinks he is.\n\nAJAX.\nIs he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nNo question.\n\nAJAX.\nWill you subscribe his thought and say he is?\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nNo, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.\n\nAJAX.\nWhy should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nYour mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise.\n\nRe-enter Ulysses.\n\nAJAX.\nI do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend’ring of toads.\n\nNESTOR.\n[Aside.] And yet he loves himself: is’t not strange?\n\nULYSSES.\nAchilles will not to the field tomorrow.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat’s his excuse?\n\nULYSSES.\nHe doth rely on none;\nBut carries on the stream of his dispose,\nWithout observance or respect of any,\nIn will peculiar and in self-admission.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhy will he not, upon our fair request,\nUntent his person and share th’air with us?\n\nULYSSES.\nThings small as nothing, for request’s sake only,\nHe makes important; possess’d he is with greatness,\nAnd speaks not to himself but with a pride\nThat quarrels at self-breath. Imagin’d worth\nHolds in his blood such swol’n and hot discourse\nThat ’twixt his mental and his active parts\nKingdom’d Achilles in commotion rages,\nAnd batters down himself. What should I say?\nHe is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it\nCry ‘No recovery.’\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nLet Ajax go to him.\nDear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.\n’Tis said he holds you well; and will be led\nAt your request a little from himself.\n\nULYSSES.\nO Agamemnon, let it not be so!\nWe’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes\nWhen they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord\nThat bastes his arrogance with his own seam\nAnd never suffers matter of the world\nEnter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve\nAnd ruminate himself—shall he be worshipp’d\nOf that we hold an idol more than he?\nNo, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord\nShall not so stale his palm, nobly acquir’d,\nNor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,\nAs amply titled as Achilles is,\nBy going to Achilles.\nThat were to enlard his fat-already pride,\nAnd add more coals to Cancer when he burns\nWith entertaining great Hyperion.\nThis lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,\nAnd say in thunder ‘Achilles go to him.’\n\nNESTOR.\n[Aside.] O, this is well! He rubs the vein of him.\n\nDIOMEDES.\n[Aside.] And how his silence drinks up this applause!\n\nAJAX.\nIf I go to him, with my armed fist I’ll pash him o’er the face.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nO, no, you shall not go.\n\nAJAX.\nAn a’ be proud with me I’ll pheeze his pride.\nLet me go to him.\n\nULYSSES.\nNot for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.\n\nAJAX.\nA paltry, insolent fellow!\n\nNESTOR.\n[Aside.] How he describes himself!\n\nAJAX.\nCan he not be sociable?\n\nULYSSES.\n[Aside.] The raven chides blackness.\n\nAJAX.\nI’ll let his humours blood.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\n[Aside.] He will be the physician that should be the patient.\n\nAJAX.\nAnd all men were o’ my mind—\n\nULYSSES.\n[Aside.] Wit would be out of fashion.\n\nAJAX.\nA’ should not bear it so, a’ should eat’s words first.\nShall pride carry it?\n\nNESTOR.\n[Aside.] And ’twould, you’d carry half.\n\nULYSSES.\n[Aside.] A’ would have ten shares.\n\nAJAX.\nI will knead him, I’ll make him supple.\n\nNESTOR.\n[Aside.] He’s not yet through warm. Force him with praises; pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.\n\nULYSSES.\n[To Agamemnon.] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.\n\nNESTOR.\nOur noble general, do not do so.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nYou must prepare to fight without Achilles.\n\nULYSSES.\nWhy ’tis this naming of him does him harm.\nHere is a man—but ’tis before his face;\nI will be silent.\n\nNESTOR.\nWherefore should you so?\nHe is not emulous, as Achilles is.\n\nULYSSES.\nKnow the whole world, he is as valiant.\n\nAJAX.\nA whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!\nWould he were a Trojan!\n\nNESTOR.\nWhat a vice were it in Ajax now—\n\nULYSSES.\nIf he were proud.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nOr covetous of praise.\n\nULYSSES.\nAy, or surly borne.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nOr strange, or self-affected.\n\nULYSSES.\nThank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure.\nPraise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;\nFam’d be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature\nThrice fam’d beyond, beyond all erudition;\nBut he that disciplin’d thine arms to fight—\nLet Mars divide eternity in twain\nAnd give him half; and, for thy vigour,\nBull-bearing Milo his addition yield\nTo sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,\nWhich, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines\nThy spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,\nInstructed by the antiquary times—\nHe must, he is, he cannot but be wise;\nBut pardon, father Nestor, were your days\nAs green as Ajax’ and your brain so temper’d,\nYou should not have the eminence of him,\nBut be as Ajax.\n\nAJAX.\nShall I call you father?\n\nNESTOR.\nAy, my good son.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nBe rul’d by him, Lord Ajax.\n\nULYSSES.\nThere is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles\nKeeps thicket. Please it our great general\nTo call together all his state of war;\nFresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow\nWe must with all our main of power stand fast;\nAnd here’s a lord—come knights from east to west\nAnd cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nGo we to council. Let Achilles sleep.\nLight boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Do you not follow the young Lord Paris?\n\nSERVANT.\nAy, sir, when he goes before me.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou depend upon him, I mean?\n\nSERVANT.\nSir, I do depend upon the Lord.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou depend upon a notable gentleman; I must needs praise him.\n\nSERVANT.\nThe Lord be praised!\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou know me, do you not?\n\nSERVANT.\nFaith, sir, superficially.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFriend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.\n\nSERVANT.\nI hope I shall know your honour better.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI do desire it.\n\nSERVANT.\nYou are in the state of grace?\n\nPANDARUS.\nGrace? Not so, friend; honour and lordship are my titles. What music is this?\n\nSERVANT.\nI do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.\n\nPANDARUS.\nKnow you the musicians?\n\nSERVANT.\nWholly, sir.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho play they to?\n\nSERVANT.\nTo the hearers, sir.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAt whose pleasure, friend?\n\nSERVANT.\nAt mine, sir, and theirs that love music.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCommand, I mean, friend.\n\nSERVANT.\nWho shall I command, sir?\n\nPANDARUS.\nFriend, we understand not one another: I am too courtly, and thou art too cunning. At whose request do these men play?\n\nSERVANT.\nThat’s to’t, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love’s invisible soul—\n\nPANDARUS.\nWho, my cousin, Cressida?\n\nSERVANT.\nNo, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her attributes?\n\nPANDARUS.\nIt should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I will make a complimental assault upon him, for my business seethes.\n\nSERVANT.\nSodden business! There’s a stew’d phrase indeed!\n\nEnter Paris and Helen, attended.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company! Fair desires, in all fair measure, fairly guide them—especially to you, fair queen! Fair thoughts be your fair pillow.\n\nHELEN.\nDear lord, you are full of fair words.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair prince, here is good broken music.\n\nPARIS.\nYou have broke it, cousin; and by my life, you shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance.\n\nHELEN.\nHe is full of harmony.\n\nPANDARUS.\nTruly, lady, no.\n\nHELEN.\nO, sir—\n\nPANDARUS.\nRude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.\n\nPARIS.\nWell said, my lord. Well, you say so in fits.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?\n\nHELEN.\nNay, this shall not hedge us out.

But, marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus—\n\nHELEN.\nMy Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord—\n\nPANDARUS.\nGo to, sweet queen, go to—commends himself most affectionately to you—\n\nHELEN.\nYou shall not bob us out of our melody. If you do, our melancholy upon your head!\n\nPANDARUS.\nSweet queen, sweet queen; that’s a sweet queen, i’ faith.\n\nHELEN.\nAnd to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no, no.—And, my lord, he desires you that, if the King call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.\n\nHELEN.\nMy Lord Pandarus!\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?\n\nPARIS.\nWhat exploit’s in hand? Where sups he tonight?\n\nHELEN.\nNay, but, my lord—\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat says my sweet queen?—My cousin will fall out with you.\n\nHELEN.\nYou must not know where he sups.\n\nPARIS.\nI’ll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNo, no, no such matter; you are wide. Come, your disposer is sick.\n\nPARIS.\nWell, I’ll make’s excuse.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?\nNo, your poor disposer’s sick.\n\nPARIS.\nI spy.\n\nPANDARUS.\nYou spy! What do you spy?—Come, give me an instrument. Now, sweet queen.\n\nHELEN.\nWhy, this is kindly done.\n\nPANDARUS.\nMy niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet queen.\n\nHELEN.\nShe shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHe? No, she’ll none of him; they two are twain.\n\nHELEN.\nFalling in, after falling out, may make them three.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCome, come. I’ll hear no more of this; I’ll sing you a song now.\n\nHELEN.\nAy, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a fine forehead.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAy, you may, you may.\n\nHELEN.\nLet thy song be love. This love will undo us all. O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!\n\nPANDARUS.\nLove! Ay, that it shall, i’ faith.\n\nPARIS.\nAy, good now, love, love, nothing but love.\n\nPANDARUS.\nIn good troth, it begins so.\n\n[Sings.]\n\n   Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!\n     For, oh, love’s bow\n    Shoots buck and doe;\n      The shaft confounds\n       Not that it wounds,\n     But tickles still the sore.\n   These lovers cry, O ho, they die!\n      Yet that which seems the wound to kill\n   Doth turn O ho! to ha! ha! he!\n      So dying love lives still.\n   O ho! a while, but ha! ha! ha!\n  O ho! groans out for ha! ha! ha!—hey ho!\n\nHELEN.\nIn love, i’ faith, to the very tip of the nose.\n\nPARIS.\nHe eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.\n\nPANDARUS.\nIs this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers. Is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who’s a-field today?\n\nPARIS.\nHector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry of Troy. I would fain have arm’d today, but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my brother Troilus went not?\n\nHELEN.\nHe hangs the lip at something. You know all, Lord Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNot I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they spend today. You’ll remember your brother’s excuse?\n\nPARIS.\nTo a hair.\n\nPANDARUS.\nFarewell, sweet queen.\n\nHELEN.\nCommend me to your niece.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI will, sweet queen.\n\n[Exit. Sound a retreat.]\n\nPARIS.\nThey’re come from the field. Let us to Priam’s hall\nTo greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you\nTo help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,\nWith these your white enchanting fingers touch’d,\nShall more obey than to the edge of steel\nOr force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more\nThan all the island kings—disarm great Hector.\n\nHELEN.\n’Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;\nYea, what he shall receive of us in duty\nGives us more palm in beauty than we have,\nYea, overshines ourself.\n\nPARIS.\nSweet, above thought I love thee.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Troy. Pandarus’ orchard.\nEnter Pandarus and Troilus’ Boy, meeting.\n\nPANDARUS.\nHow now! Where’s thy master? At my cousin Cressida’s?\n\nBOY.\nNo, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.\n\nEnter Troilus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nO, here he comes. How now, how now?\n\nTROILUS.\nSirrah, walk off.\n\n[Exit Boy.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nHave you seen my cousin?\n\nTROILUS.\nNo, Pandarus. I stalk about her door\nLike a strange soul upon the Stygian banks\nStaying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,\nAnd give me swift transportance to these fields\nWhere I may wallow in the lily beds\nPropos’d for the deserver! O gentle Pandar,\nfrom Cupid’s shoulder pluck his painted wings,\nand fly with me to Cressid!\n\nPANDARUS.\nWalk here i’ th’ orchard, I’ll bring her straight.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTROILUS.\nI am giddy; expectation whirls me round.\nTh’imaginary relish is so sweet\nThat it enchants my sense; what will it be\nWhen that the wat’ry palate tastes indeed\nLove’s thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me;\nSounding destruction; or some joy too fine,\nToo subtle-potent, tun’d too sharp in sweetness,\nFor the capacity of my ruder powers.\nI fear it much; and I do fear besides\nThat I shall lose distinction in my joys;\nAs doth a battle, when they charge on heaps\nThe enemy flying.\n\nRe-enter Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nShe’s making her ready, she’ll come straight; you must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as if she were fray’d with a sprite. I’ll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain; she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta’en sparrow.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTROILUS.\nEven such a passion doth embrace my bosom.\nMy heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,\nAnd all my powers do their bestowing lose,\nLike vassalage at unawares encount’ring\nThe eye of majesty.\n\nRe-enter Pandarus with Cressida.\n\nPANDARUS.\nCome, come, what need you blush? Shame’s a baby. Here she is now; swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.—What, are you gone again? You must be watch’d ere you be made tame, must you? Come your ways, come your ways; and you draw backward, we’ll put you i’ th’ fills. Why do you not speak to her? Come, draw this curtain and let’s see your picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! And ’twere dark, you’d close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now, a kiss in fee-farm! Build there, carpenter; the air is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i’ th’ river. Go to, go to.\n\nTROILUS.\nYou have bereft me of all words, lady.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWords pay no debts, give her deeds; but she’ll bereave you o’ th’ deeds too, if she call your activity in question. What, billing again? Here’s ‘In witness whereof the parties interchangeably.’ Come in, come in; I’ll go get a fire.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWill you walk in, my lord?\n\nTROILUS.\nO Cressid, how often have I wish’d me thus!\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWish’d, my lord! The gods grant—O my lord!\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat should they grant? What makes this pretty abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nMore dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.\n\nTROILUS.\nFears make devils of cherubins; they never see truly.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBlind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear. To fear the worst oft cures the worse.\n\nTROILUS.\nO, let my lady apprehend no fear! In all Cupid’s pageant there is presented no monster.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nNor nothing monstrous neither?\n\nTROILUS.\nNothing, but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite, and the execution confin’d; that the desire is boundless, and the act a slave to limit.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nThey say all lovers swear more performance than they are able, and yet reserve an ability that they never perform; vowing more than the perfection of ten, and discharging less than the tenth part of one. They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not monsters?\n\nTROILUS.\nAre there such? Such are not we. Praise us as we are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go bare till merit crown it. No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present. We will not name desert before his birth; and, being born, his addition shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth; and what truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWill you walk in, my lord?\n\nRe-enter Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nWhat, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nWell, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.\n\nPANDARUS.\nI thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you’ll give him me. Be true to my lord; if he flinch, chide me for it.\n\nTROILUS.\nYou know now your hostages: your uncle’s word and my firm faith.\n\nPANDARUS.\nNay, I’ll give my word for her too: our kindred, though they be long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won; they are burs, I can tell you; they’ll stick where they are thrown.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nBoldness comes to me now and brings me heart.\nPrince Troilus, I have lov’d you night and day\nFor many weary months.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhy was my Cressid then so hard to win?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nHard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,\nWith the first glance that ever—pardon me.\nIf I confess much, you will play the tyrant.\nI love you now; but till now not so much\nBut I might master it. In faith, I lie;\nMy thoughts were like unbridled children, grown\nToo headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!\nWhy have I blabb’d? Who shall be true to us,\nWhen we are so unsecret to ourselves?\nBut, though I lov’d you well, I woo’d you not;\nAnd yet, good faith, I wish’d myself a man,\nOr that we women had men’s privilege\nOf speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,\nFor in this rapture I shall surely speak\nThe thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,\nCunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws\nMy very soul of counsel. Stop my mouth.\n\nTROILUS.\nAnd shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.\n\nPANDARUS.\nPretty, i’ faith.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nMy lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;\n’Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.\nI am asham’d. O heavens! what have I done?\nFor this time will I take my leave, my lord.\n\nTROILUS.\nYour leave, sweet Cressid!\n\nPANDARUS.\nLeave! And you take leave till tomorrow morning—\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPray you, content you.\n\nTROILUS.\nWhat offends you, lady?\n\nCRESSIDA.\nSir, mine own company.\n\nTROILUS.\nYou cannot shun yourself.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nLet me go and try.\nI have a kind of self resides with you;\nBut an unkind self, that itself will leave\nTo be another’s fool. I would be gone.\nWhere is my wit? I know not what I speak.\n\nTROILUS.\nWell know they what they speak that speak so wisely.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nPerchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;\nAnd fell so roundly to a large confession\nTo angle for your thoughts; but you are wise—\nOr else you love not; for to be wise and love\nExceeds man’s might; that dwells with gods above.\n\nTROILUS.\nO that I thought it could be in a woman—\nAs, if it can, I will presume in you—\nTo feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;\nTo keep her constancy in plight and youth,\nOutliving beauty’s outward, with a mind\nThat doth renew swifter than blood decays!\nOr that persuasion could but thus convince me\nThat my integrity and truth to you\nMight be affronted with the match and weight\nOf such a winnowed purity in love.\nHow were I then uplifted! But, alas,\nI am as true as truth’s simplicity,\nAnd simpler than the infancy of truth.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nIn that I’ll war with you.\n\nTROILUS.\nO virtuous fight,\nWhen right with right wars who shall be most right!\nTrue swains in love shall in the world to come\nApprove their truth by Troilus, when their rhymes,\nFull of protest, of oath, and big compare,\nWant similes, truth tir’d with iteration—\nAs true as steel, as plantage to the moon,\nAs sun to day, as turtle to her mate,\nAs iron to adamant, as earth to th’ centre—\nYet, after all comparisons of truth,\nAs truth’s authentic author to be cited,\n‘As true as Troilus’ shall crown up the verse\nAnd sanctify the numbers.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nProphet may you be!\nIf I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,\nWhen time is old and hath forgot itself,\nWhen waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,\nAnd blind oblivion swallow’d cities up,\nAnd mighty states characterless are grated\nTo dusty nothing—yet let memory\nFrom false to false, among false maids in love,\nUpbraid my falsehood when th’ have said ‘As false\nAs air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,\nAs fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer’s calf,\nPard to the hind, or stepdame to her son’—\nYea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,\n‘As false as Cressid.’\n\nPANDARUS.\nGo to, a bargain made; seal it, seal it; I’ll be the witness. Here I hold your hand; here my cousin’s. If ever you prove false one to another, since I have taken such pains to bring you together, let all pitiful goers-between be call’d to the world’s end after my name—call them all Pandars; let all constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids, and all brokers between Pandars. Say ‘Amen.’\n\nTROILUS.\nAmen.\n\nCRESSIDA.\nAmen.\n\nPANDARUS.\nAmen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death. Away!\n\n[Exeunt Troilus and Cressida.]\n\nAnd Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,\nBed, chamber, pander, to provide this gear!\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. The Greek camp.\nFlourish. Enter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor, Ajax, Menelaus and Calchas.\n\nCALCHAS.\nNow, Princes, for the service I have done,\nTh’advantage of the time prompts me aloud\nTo call for recompense. Appear it to your mind\nThat, through the sight I bear in things to come,\nI have abandon’d Troy, left my possession,\nIncurr’d a traitor’s name, expos’d myself\nFrom certain and possess’d conveniences\nTo doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring from me all\nThat time, acquaintance, custom, and condition,\nMade tame and most familiar to my nature;\nAnd here, to do you service, am become\nAs new into the world, strange, unacquainted—\nI do beseech you, as in way of taste,\nTo give me now a little benefit\nOut of those many regist’red in promise,\nWhich you say live to come in my behalf.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat wouldst thou of us, Trojan? Make demand.\n\nCALCHAS.\nYou have a Trojan prisoner call’d Antenor,\nYesterday took; Troy holds him very dear.\nOft have you—often have you thanks therefore—\nDesir’d my Cressid in right great exchange,\nWhom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,\nI know, is such a wrest in their affairs\nThat their negotiations all must slack\nWanting his manage; and they will almost\nGive us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,\nIn change of him. Let him be sent, great Princes,\nAnd he shall buy my daughter; and her presence\nShall quite strike off all service I have done\nIn most accepted pain.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nLet Diomedes bear him,\nAnd bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have\nWhat he requests of us. Good Diomed,\nFurnish you fairly for this interchange;\nWithal, bring word if Hector will tomorrow\nBe answer’d in his challenge. Ajax is ready.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nThis shall I undertake; and ’tis a burden\nWhich I am proud to bear.\n\n[Exeunt Diomedes and Calchas.]\n\n[Achilles and Patroclus stand in their tent.]\n\nULYSSES.\nAchilles stands i’ th’entrance of his tent.\nPlease it our general pass strangely by him,\nAs if he were forgot; and, Princes all,\nLay negligent and loose regard upon him.\nI will come last. ’Tis like he’ll question me\nWhy such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn’d on him.\nIf so, I have derision med’cinable\nTo use between your strangeness and his pride,\nWhich his own will shall have desire to drink.\nIt may do good. Pride hath no other glass\nTo show itself but pride; for supple knees\nFeed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWe’ll execute your purpose, and put on\nA form of strangeness as we pass along.\nSo do each lord; and either greet him not,\nOr else disdainfully, which shall shake him more\nThan if not look’d on. I will lead the way.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat comes the general to speak with me?\nYou know my mind. I’ll fight no more ’gainst Troy.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWhat says Achilles? Would he aught with us?\n\nNESTOR.\nWould you, my lord, aught with the general?\n\nACHILLES.\nNo.\n\nNESTOR.\nNothing, my lord.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nThe better.\n\n[Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor.]\n\nACHILLES.\nGood day, good day.\n\nMENELAUS.\nHow do you? How do you?\n\n[Exit.]\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat, does the cuckold scorn me?\n\nAJAX.\nHow now, Patroclus?\n\nACHILLES.\nGood morrow, Ajax.\n\nAJAX.\nHa?\n\nACHILLES.\nGood morrow.\n\nAJAX.\nAy, and good next day too.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nThey pass by strangely. They were us’d to bend,\nTo send their smiles before them to Achilles,\nTo come as humbly as they us’d to creep\nTo holy altars.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat, am I poor of late?\n’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with fortune,\nMust fall out with men too. What the declin’d is,\nHe shall as soon read in the eyes of others\nAs feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,\nShow not their mealy wings but to the summer;\nAnd not a man for being simply man\nHath any honour, but honour for those honours\nThat are without him, as place, riches, and favour,\nPrizes of accident, as oft as merit;\nWhich when they fall, as being slippery standers,\nThe love that lean’d on them as slippery too,\nDoth one pluck down another, and together\nDie in the fall. But ’tis not so with me:\nFortune and I are friends; I do enjoy\nAt ample point all that I did possess\nSave these men’s looks; who do, methinks, find out\nSomething not worth in me such rich beholding\nAs they have often given. Here is Ulysses.\nI’ll interrupt his reading.\nHow now, Ulysses!\n\nULYSSES.\nNow, great Thetis’ son!\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat are you reading?\n\nULYSSES.\nA strange fellow here\nWrites me that man—how dearly ever parted,\nHow much in having, or without or in—\nCannot make boast to have that which he hath,\nNor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;\nAs when his virtues shining upon others\nHeat them, and they retort that heat again\nTo the first giver.\n\nACHILLES.\nThis is not strange, Ulysses.\nThe beauty that is borne here in the face\nThe bearer knows not, but commends itself\nTo others’ eyes; nor doth the eye itself—\nThat most pure spirit of sense—behold itself,\nNot going from itself; but eye to eye opposed\nSalutes each other with each other’s form;\nFor speculation turns not to itself\nTill it hath travell’d, and is mirror’d there\nWhere it may see itself. This is not strange at all.\n\nULYSSES.\nI do not strain at the position—\nIt is familiar—but at the author’s drift;\nWho, in his circumstance, expressly proves\nThat no man is the lord of anything,\nThough in and of him there be much consisting,\nTill he communicate his parts to others;\nNor doth he of himself know them for aught\nTill he behold them formed in the applause\nWhere th’are extended; who, like an arch, reverb’rate\nThe voice again; or, like a gate of steel\nFronting the sun, receives and renders back\nHis figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;\nAnd apprehended here immediately\nTh’unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!\nA very horse that has he knows not what!\nNature, what things there are\nMost abject in regard and dear in use!\nWhat things again most dear in the esteem\nAnd poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow—\nAn act that very chance doth throw upon him—\nAjax renown’d. O heavens, what some men do,\nWhile some men leave to do!\nHow some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,\nWhiles others play the idiots in her eyes!\nHow one man eats into another’s pride,\nWhile pride is fasting in his wantonness!\nTo see these Grecian lords!—why, even already\nThey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,\nAs if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast,\nAnd great Troy shrieking.\n\nACHILLES.\nI do believe it; for they pass’d by me\nAs misers do by beggars, neither gave to me\nGood word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?\n\nULYSSES.\nTime hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\nWherein he puts alms for oblivion,\nA great-siz’d monster of ingratitudes.\nThose scraps are good deeds past, which are devour’d\nAs fast as they are made, forgot as soon\nAs done. Perseverance, dear my lord,\nKeeps honour bright. To have done is to hang\nQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\nIn monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way;\nFor honour travels in a strait so narrow—\nWhere one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,\nFor emulation hath a thousand sons\nThat one by one pursue; if you give way,\nOr hedge aside from the direct forthright,\nLike to an ent’red tide they all rush by\nAnd leave you hindmost;\nOr, like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,\nLie there for pavement to the abject rear,\nO’er-run and trampled on. Then what they do in present,\nThough less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours;\nFor Time is like a fashionable host,\nThat slightly shakes his parting guest by th’hand;\nAnd with his arms out-stretch’d, as he would fly,\nGrasps in the comer. The welcome ever smiles,\nAnd farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek\nRemuneration for the thing it was;\nFor beauty, wit,\nHigh birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,\nLove, friendship, charity, are subjects all\nTo envious and calumniating Time.\nOne touch of nature makes the whole world kin—\nThat all with one consent praise new-born gauds,\nThough they are made and moulded of things past,\nAnd give to dust that is a little gilt\nMore laud than gilt o’er-dusted.\nThe present eye praises the present object.\nThen marvel not, thou great and complete man,\nThat all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,\nSince things in motion sooner catch the eye\nThan what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,\nAnd still it might, and yet it may again,\nIf thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive\nAnd case thy reputation in thy tent,\nWhose glorious deeds but in these fields of late\nMade emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves,\nAnd drave great Mars to faction.\n\nACHILLES.\nOf this my privacy\nI have strong reasons.\n\nULYSSES.\nBut ’gainst your privacy\nThe reasons are more potent and heroical.\n’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love\nWith one of Priam’s daughters.\n\nACHILLES.\nHa! known!\n\nULYSSES.\nIs that a wonder?\nThe providence that’s in a watchful state\nKnows almost every grain of Plutus’ gold;\nFinds bottom in th’uncomprehensive deeps;\nKeeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,\nDo thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\nThere is a mystery—with whom relation\nDurst never meddle—in the soul of state,\nWhich hath an operation more divine\nThan breath or pen can give expressure to.\nAll the commerce that you have had with Troy\nAs perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;\nAnd better would it fit Achilles much\nTo throw down Hector than Polyxena.\nBut it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,\nWhen fame shall in our island sound her trump,\nAnd all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing\n‘Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win;\nBut our great Ajax bravely beat down him.’\nFarewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.\nThe fool slides o’er the ice that you should break.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPATROCLUS.\nTo this effect, Achilles, have I mov’d you.\nA woman impudent and mannish grown\nIs not more loath’d than an effeminate man\nIn time of action. I stand condemn’d for this;\nThey think my little stomach to the war\nAnd your great love to me restrains you thus.\nSweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid\nShall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,\nAnd, like a dew-drop from the lion’s mane,\nBe shook to air.\n\nACHILLES.\nShall Ajax fight with Hector?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAy, and perhaps receive much honour by him.\n\nACHILLES.\nI see my reputation is at stake;\nMy fame is shrewdly gor’d.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nO, then, beware:\nThose wounds heal ill that men do give themselves;\nOmission to do what is necessary\nSeals a commission to a blank of danger;\nAnd danger, like an ague, subtly taints\nEven then when they sit idly in the sun.\n\nACHILLES.\nGo call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.\nI’ll send the fool to Ajax, and desire him\nT’invite the Trojan lords, after the combat,\nTo see us here unarm’d. I have a woman’s longing,\nAn appetite that I am sick withal,\nTo see great Hector in his weeds of peace;\nTo talk with him, and to behold his visage,\nEven to my full of view.\n\nEnter Thersites.\n\nA labour sav’d!\n\nTHERSITES.\nA wonder!\n\nACHILLES.\nWhat?\n\nTHERSITES.\nAjax goes up and down the field asking for himself.\n\nACHILLES.\nHow so?\n\nTHERSITES.\nHe must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.\n\nACHILLES.\nHow can that be?\n\nTHERSITES.\nWhy, a’ stalks up and down like a peacock—a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning, bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should say ‘There were wit in this head, and ’twould out’; and so there is; but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. The man’s undone for ever; for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat, he’ll break’t himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said ‘Good morrow, Ajax’; and he replies ‘Thanks, Agamemnon.’ What think you of this man that takes me for the general? He’s grown a very land fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like leather jerkin.\n\nACHILLES.\nThou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.\n\nTHERSITES.\nWho, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody; he professes not answering. Speaking is for beggars: he wears his tongue in’s arms. I will put on his presence. Let Patroclus make his demands to me, you shall see the pageant of Ajax.\n\nACHILLES.\nTo him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm’d to my tent; and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honour’d Captain General of the Grecian army, Agamemnon. Do this.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nJove bless great Ajax!\n\nTHERSITES.\nHum!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nI come from the worthy Achilles—\n\nTHERSITES.\nHa!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWho most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent—\n\nTHERSITES.\nHum!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAnd to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.\n\nTHERSITES.\nAgamemnon?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nAy, my lord.\n\nTHERSITES.\nHa!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhat you say to’t?\n\nTHERSITES.\nGod buy you, with all my heart.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nYour answer, sir.\n\nTHERSITES.\nIf tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other. Howsoever, he shall pay for me ere he has me.\n\nPATROCLUS.\nYour answer, sir.\n\nTHERSITES.\nFare ye well, with all my heart.\n\nACHILLES.\nWhy, but he is not in this tune, is he?\n\nTHERSITES.\nNo, but out of tune thus. What music will be in him when Hector has knock’d out his brains, I know not; but, I am sure, none; unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.\n\nACHILLES.\nCome, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.\n\nTHERSITES.\nLet me bear another to his horse; for that’s the more capable creature.\n\nACHILLES.\nMy mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr’d;\nAnd I myself see not the bottom of it.\n\n[Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus.]\n\nTHERSITES.\nWould the fountain of your mind were clear again, that I might water an ass at it. I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.\n\n[Exit.]",

I constantly believe—\nOr rather call my thought a certain knowledge—\nMy brother Troilus lodges there tonight.\nRouse him and give him note of our approach,\nWith the whole quality wherefore; I fear\nWe shall be much unwelcome.\n\nAENEAS.\nThat I assure you:\nTroilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece\nThan Cressid borne from Troy.\n\nPARIS.\nThere is no help;\nThe bitter disposition of the time\nWill have it so. On, lord; we’ll follow you.\n\nAENEAS.\nGood morrow, all.\n\n[Exit with servant.]\n\nPARIS.\nAnd tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,\nEven in the soul of sound good-fellowship,\nWho in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best,\nMyself, or Menelaus?\n\nDIOMEDES.\nBoth alike:\nHe merits well to have her that doth seek her,\nNot making any scruple of her soilure,\nWith such a hell of pain and world of charge;\nAnd you as well to keep her that defend her,\nNot palating the taste of her dishonour,\nWith such a costly loss of wealth and friends.\nHe like a puling cuckold would drink up\nThe lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;\nYou, like a lecher, out of whorish loins\nAre pleas’d to breed out your inheritors.\nBoth merits pois’d, each weighs nor less nor more,\nBut he as he, the heavier for a whore.\n\nPARIS.\nYou are too bitter to your country-woman.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nShe’s bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:\nFor every false drop in her bawdy veins\nA Grecian’s life hath sunk; for every scruple\nOf her contaminated carrion weight\nA Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak,\nShe hath not given so many good words breath\nAs for her Greeks and Trojans suff’red death.\n\nPARIS.\nFair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,\nDispraise the thing that you desire to buy;\nBut we in silence hold this virtue well,\nWe’ll not commend what we intend to sell.\nHere lies our way.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

I tell thee, lord of Greece,\nShe is as far high-soaring o’er thy praises\nAs thou unworthy to be call’d her servant.\nI charge thee use her well, even for my charge;\nFor, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,\nThough the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,\nI’ll cut thy throat.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nO, be not mov’d, Prince Troilus.\nLet me be privileg’d by my place and message\nTo be a speaker free: when I am hence\nI’ll answer to my lust. And know you, lord,\nI’ll nothing do on charge: to her own worth\nShe shall be priz’d. But that you say ‘Be’t so,’\nI speak it in my spirit and honour, ‘No.’\n\nTROILUS.\nCome, to the port. I’ll tell thee, Diomed,\nThis brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.\nLady, give me your hand; and, as we walk,\nTo our own selves bend we our needful talk.\n\n[Exeunt Troilus, Cressida and Diomedes.]\n\n[Sound trumpet.]\n\nPARIS.\nHark! Hector’s trumpet.\n\nAENEAS.\nHow have we spent this morning!\nThe Prince must think me tardy and remiss,\nThat swore to ride before him to the field.\n\nPARIS.\n’Tis Troilus’ fault. Come, come to field with him.\n\nDEIPHOBUS.\nLet us make ready straight.\n\nAENEAS.\nYea, with a bridegroom’s fresh alacrity\nLet us address to tend on Hector’s heels.\nThe glory of our Troy doth this day lie\nOn his fair worth and single chivalry.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n",

Give me thy hand, my cousin;\nI will go eat with thee, and see your knights.\n\nAgamemnon and the rest of the Greeks come forward.\n\nAJAX.\nGreat Agamemnon comes to meet us here.\n\nHECTOR.\nThe worthiest of them tell me name by name;\nBut for Achilles, my own searching eyes\nShall find him by his large and portly size.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWorthy all arms! as welcome as to one\nThat would be rid of such an enemy.\nBut that’s no welcome. Understand more clear,\nWhat’s past and what’s to come is strew’d with husks\nAnd formless ruin of oblivion;\nBut in this extant moment, faith and troth,\nStrain’d purely from all hollow bias-drawing,\nBids thee with most divine integrity,\nFrom heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.\n\nHECTOR.\nI thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\n[To Troilus.] My well-fam’d lord of Troy, no less to you.\n\nMENELAUS.\nLet me confirm my princely brother’s greeting.\nYou brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.\n\nHECTOR.\nWho must we answer?\n\nAENEAS.\nThe noble Menelaus.\n\nHECTOR.\nO you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!\nMock not that I affect the untraded oath;\nYour quondam wife swears still by Venus’ glove.\nShe’s well, but bade me not commend her to you.\n\nMENELAUS.\nName her not now, sir; she’s a deadly theme.\n\nHECTOR.\nO, pardon; I offend.\n\nNESTOR.\nI have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft,\nLabouring for destiny, make cruel way\nThrough ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee,\nAs hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,\nDespising many forfeits and subduements,\nWhen thou hast hung thy advanced sword i’ th’air,\nNot letting it decline on the declined;\nThat I have said to some my standers-by\n‘Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!’\nAnd I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,\nWhen that a ring of Greeks have shrap’d thee in,\nLike an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen;\nBut this thy countenance, still lock’d in steel,\nI never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,\nAnd once fought with him. He was a soldier good,\nBut, by great Mars, the captain of us all,\nNever like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee;\nAnd, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.\n\nAENEAS.\n’Tis the old Nestor.\n\nHECTOR.\nLet me embrace thee, good old chronicle,\nThat hast so long walk’d hand in hand with time.\nMost reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.\n\nNESTOR.\nI would my arms could match thee in contention\nAs they contend with thee in courtesy.\n\nHECTOR.\nI would they could.\n\nNESTOR.\nHa!\nBy this white beard, I’d fight with thee tomorrow.\nWell, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.\n\nULYSSES.\nI wonder now how yonder city stands,\nWhen we have here her base and pillar by us.\n\nHECTOR.\nI know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.\nAh, sir, there’s many a Greek and Trojan dead,\nSince first I saw yourself and Diomed\nIn Ilion on your Greekish embassy.\n\nULYSSES.\nSir, I foretold you then what would ensue.\nMy prophecy is but half his journey yet;\nFor yonder walls, that pertly front your town,\nYon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,\nMust kiss their own feet.\n\nHECTOR.\nI must not believe you.\nThere they stand yet; and modestly I think\nThe fall of every Phrygian stone will cost\nA drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;\nAnd that old common arbitrator, Time,\nWill one day end it.\n\nULYSSES.\nSo to him we leave it.\nMost gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome.\nAfter the General, I beseech you next\nTo feast with me and see me at my tent.\n\nACHILLES.\nI shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!\nNow, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;\nI have with exact view perus’d thee, Hector,\nAnd quoted joint by joint.\n\nHECTOR.\nIs this Achilles?\n\nACHILLES.\nI am Achilles.\n\nHECTOR.\nStand fair, I pray thee; let me look on thee.\n\nACHILLES.\nBehold thy fill.\n\nHECTOR.\nNay, I have done already.\n\nACHILLES.\nThou art too brief. I will the second time,\nAs I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.\n\nHECTOR.\nO, like a book of sport thou’lt read me o’er;\nBut there’s more in me than thou understand’st.\nWhy dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?\n\nACHILLES.\nTell me, you heavens, in which part of his body\nShall I destroy him? Whether there, or there, or there?\nThat I may give the local wound a name,\nAnd make distinct the very breach whereout\nHector’s great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens.\n\nHECTOR.\nIt would discredit the blest gods, proud man,\nTo answer such a question. Stand again.\nThink’st thou to catch my life so pleasantly\nAs to prenominate in nice conjecture\nWhere thou wilt hit me dead?\n\nACHILLES.\nI tell thee yea.\n\nHECTOR.\nWert thou an oracle to tell me so,\nI’d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;\nFor I’ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;\nBut, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,\nI’ll kill thee everywhere, yea, o’er and o’er.\nYou wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag.\nHis insolence draws folly from my lips;\nBut I’ll endeavour deeds to match these words,\nOr may I never—\n\nAJAX.\nDo not chafe thee, cousin;\nAnd you, Achilles, let these threats alone\nTill accident or purpose bring you to’t.\nYou may have every day enough of Hector,\nIf you have stomach. The general state, I fear,\nCan scarce entreat you to be odd with him.\n\nHECTOR.\nI pray you let us see you in the field;\nWe have had pelting wars since you refus’d\nThe Grecians’ cause.\n\nACHILLES.\nDost thou entreat me, Hector?\nTomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death;\nTonight all friends.\n\nHECTOR.\nThy hand upon that match.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nFirst, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;\nThere in the full convive we; afterwards,\nAs Hector’s leisure and your bounties shall\nConcur together, severally entreat him.\nBeat loud the tambourines, let the trumpets blow,\nThat this great soldier may his welcome know.\n\n[Exeunt all but Troilus and Ulysses.]\n\nTROILUS.\nMy Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,\nIn what place of the field doth Calchas keep?\n\nULYSSES.\nAt Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus.\nThere Diomed doth feast with him tonight,\nWho neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,\nBut gives all gaze and bent of amorous view\nOn the fair Cressid.\n\nTROILUS.\nShall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,\nAfter we part from Agamemnon’s tent,\nTo bring me thither?\n\nULYSSES.\nYou shall command me, sir.\nAs gentle tell me of what honour was\nThis Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there\nThat wails her absence?\n\nTROILUS.\nO, sir, to such as boasting show their scars\nA mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?\nShe was belov’d, she lov’d; she is, and doth;\nBut still sweet love is food for fortune’s tooth.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

What’s that?\n\nTHERSITES.\nWhy, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases of the south, the guts-griping ruptures, catarrhs, loads o’ gravel in the back, lethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas, lime-kilns i’ th’ palm, incurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take again such preposterous discoveries!\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhy, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou to curse thus?\n\nTHERSITES.\nDo I curse thee?\n\nPATROCLUS.\nWhy, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable cur, no.\n\nTHERSITES.\nNo! Why art thou, then, exasperate, thou idle immaterial skein of sleave silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal’s purse, thou?

I will not break it.\nFall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;\nMy major vow lies here, this I’ll obey.\nCome, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent;\nThis night in banqueting must all be spent.\nAway, Patroclus!\n\n[Exit with Patroclus.]\n\nTHERSITES.\nWith too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too little blood they do, I’ll be a curer of madmen. Here’s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain as ear-wax; and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull, the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain at his brother’s leg, to what form but that he is, should wit larded with malice, and malice forced with wit, turn him to? To an ass, were nothing: he is both ass and ox. To an ox, were nothing: he is both ox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchook, a toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus. Hey-day! sprites and fires!\n\nEnter Hector, Troilus, Ajax, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Menelaus and Diomedes with lights.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nWe go wrong, we go wrong.\n\nAJAX.\nNo, yonder ’tis;\nThere, where we see the lights.\n\nHECTOR.\nI trouble you.\n\nAJAX.\nNo, not a whit.\n\nULYSSES.\nHere comes himself to guide you.\n\nRe-enter Achilles.\n\nACHILLES.\nWelcome, brave Hector; welcome, Princes all.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nSo now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night;\nAjax commands the guard to tend on you.\n\nHECTOR.\nThanks, and good night to the Greeks’ general.\n\nMENELAUS.\nGood night, my lord.\n\nHECTOR.\nGood night, sweet Lord Menelaus.\n\nTHERSITES.\nSweet draught! ‘Sweet’ quoth a’!\nSweet sink, sweet sewer!\n\nACHILLES.\nGood night and welcome, both at once, to those\nThat go or tarry.\n\nAGAMEMNON.\nGood night.\n\n[Exeunt Agamemnon and Menelaus.]\n\nACHILLES.\nOld Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,\nKeep Hector company an hour or two.\n\nDIOMEDES.\nI cannot, lord; I have important business,\nThe tide whereof is now.

He will spend his mouth and promise, like Brabbler the hound; but when he performs, astronomers foretell it: it is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his word. I will rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps a Trojan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas’ tent. I’ll after. Nothing but lechery! All incontinent varlets!\n\n[Exit.]",

Never did young man fancy\nWith so eternal and so fix’d a soul.\nHark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,\nSo much by weight hate I her Diomed.\nThat sleeve is mine that he’ll bear on his helm;\nWere it a casque compos’d by Vulcan’s skill\nMy sword should bite it. Not the dreadful spout\nWhich shipmen do the hurricano call,\nConstring’d in mass by the almighty sun,\nShall dizzy with more clamour Neptune’s ear\nIn his descent than shall my prompted sword\nFalling on Diomed.\n\nTHERSITES.\nHe’ll tickle it for his concupy.\n\nTROILUS.\nO Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!\nLet all untruths stand by thy stained name,\nAnd they’ll seem glorious.\n\nULYSSES.\nO, contain yourself;\nYour passion draws ears hither.\n\nEnter Aeneas.\n\nAENEAS.\nI have been seeking you this hour, my lord.\nHector, by this, is arming him in Troy;\nAjax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.\n\nTROILUS.\nHave with you, Prince. My courteous lord, adieu.\nFairwell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,\nStand fast, and wear a castle on thy head.\n\nULYSSES.\nI’ll bring you to the gates.\n\nTROILUS.\nAccept distracted thanks.\n\n[Exeunt Troilus, Aeneas and Ulysses.]\n\nTHERSITES. Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore; the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab. Lechery, lechery! Still wars and lechery! Nothing else holds fashion. A burning devil take them!\n\n[Exit.]",

No; this is Diomed’s Cressida.\nIf beauty have a soul, this is not she;\nIf souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,\nIf sanctimony be the god’s delight,\nIf there be rule in unity itself,\nThis was not she. O madness of discourse,\nThat cause sets up with and against itself!\nBi-fold authority! where reason can revolt\nWithout perdition, and loss assume all reason\nWithout revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.\nWithin my soul there doth conduce a fight\nOf this strange nature, that a thing inseparate\nDivides more wider than the sky and earth;\nAnd yet the spacious breadth of this division\nAdmits no orifice for a point as subtle\nAs Ariachne’s broken woof to enter.\nInstance, O instance! strong as Pluto’s gates:\nCressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven.\nInstance, O instance! strong as heaven itself:\nThe bonds of heaven are slipp’d, dissolv’d, and loos’d;\nAnd with another knot, five-finger-tied,\nThe fractions of her faith, orts of her love,\nThe fragments, scraps, the bits, and greasy relics\nOf her o’er-eaten faith, are given to Diomed.\n\nULYSSES.\nMay worthy Troilus be half attach’d\nWith that which here his passion doth express?\n\nTROILUS.\nAy, Greek; and that shall be divulged well\nIn characters as red as Mars his heart\nInflam’d with Venus. Never did young man fancy\nWith so eternal and so fix’d a soul.\nHark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,\nSo much by weight hate I her Diomed.\nThat sleeve is mine that he’ll bear on his helm;\nWere it a casque compos’d by Vulcan’s skill\nMy sword should bite it. Not the dreadful spout\nWhich shipmen do the hurricano call,\nConstring’d in mass by the almighty sun,\nShall dizzy with more clamour Neptune’s ear\nIn his descent than shall my prompted sword\nFalling on Diomed.\n\nTHERSITES.\nHe’ll tickle it for his concupy.\n\nTROILUS.\nO Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!\nLet all untruths stand by thy stained name,\nAnd they’ll seem glorious.\n\nULYSSES.\nO, contain yourself;\nYour passion draws ears hither.\n\nEnter Aeneas.\n\nAENEAS.\nI have been seeking you this hour, my lord.\nHector, by this, is arming him in Troy;\nAjax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.\n\nTROILUS.\nHave with you, Prince. My courteous lord, adieu.\nFairwell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,\nStand fast, and wear a castle on thy head.\n\nULYSSES.\nI’ll bring you to the gates.\n\nTROILUS.\nAccept distracted thanks.\n\n[Exeunt Troilus, Aeneas and Ulysses.]\n\nTHERSITES. Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore; the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab. Lechery, lechery! Still wars and lechery! Nothing else holds fashion. A burning devil take them!\n\n[Exit.]",

Another part of the plain.\nEnter Hector.\n\nHECTOR.\nMost putrified core so fair without,\nThy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.\nNow is my day’s work done; I’ll take my breath:\nRest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death!\n\n[Disarms.]\n\nEnter Achilles and Myrmidons.\n\nACHILLES.\nLook, Hector, how the sun begins to set,\nHow ugly night comes breathing at his heels;\nEven with the vail and dark’ning of the sun,\nTo close the day up, Hector’s life is done.\n\nHECTOR.\nI am unarm’d; forego this vantage, Greek.\n\nACHILLES.\nStrike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.\n\n[Hector falls.]\n\nSo, Ilion, fall thou next! Now, Troy, sink down;\nHere lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.\nOn, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain\n‘Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.’\n\n[A retreat sounded.]\n\nHark! a retire upon our Grecian part.\n\nMYRMIDON.\nThe Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.\n\nACHILLES.\nThe dragon wing of night o’erspreads the earth\nAnd, stickler-like, the armies separates.\nMy half-supp’d sword, that frankly would have fed,\nPleas’d with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.\n\n[Sheathes his sword.]\n\nCome, tie his body to my horse’s tail;\nAlong the field I will the Trojan trail.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

The gods forbid!\n\nTROILUS.\nHe’s dead, and at the murderer’s horse’s tail,\nIn beastly sort, dragg’d through the shameful field.\nFrown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed.\nSit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy.\nI say at once let your brief plagues be mercy,\nAnd linger not our sure destructions on.\n\nAENEAS.\nMy lord, you do discomfort all the host.\n\nTROILUS.\nYou understand me not that tell me so.\nI do not speak of flight, of fear of death,\nBut dare all imminence that gods and men\nAddress their dangers in. Hector is gone.\nWho shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?\nLet him that will a screech-owl aye be call’d\nGo in to Troy, and say there ‘Hector’s dead.’\nThere is a word will Priam turn to stone;\nMake wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,\nCold statues of the youth; and, in a word,\nScare Troy out of itself. But, march away;\nHector is dead; there is no more to say.\nStay yet. You vile abominable tents,\nThus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,\nLet Titan rise as early as he dare,\nI’ll through and through you. And, thou great-siz’d coward,\nNo space of earth shall sunder our two hates;\nI’ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,\nThat mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy’s thoughts.\nStrike a free march to Troy. With comfort go;\nHope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.\n\nEnter Pandarus.\n\nPANDARUS.\nBut hear you, hear you!\n\nTROILUS.\nHence, broker-lackey. Ignominy and shame\nPursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!\n\n[Exeunt all but Pandarus.]\n\nPANDARUS.\nA goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world! world! Thus is the poor agent despis’d! O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work, and how ill requited! Why should our endeavour be so lov’d, and the performance so loathed? What verse for it? What instance for it? Let me see—\n\n  Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing\n  Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;\n  And being once subdu’d in armed trail,\n  Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.\n\nGood traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths.\nAs many as be here of Pandar’s hall,\nYour eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar’s fall;\nOr, if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,\nThough not for me, yet for your aching bones.\nBrethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,\nSome two months hence my will shall here be made.\nIt should be now, but that my fear is this,\nSome galled goose of Winchester would hiss.\nTill then I’ll sweat and seek about for eases,\nAnd at that time bequeath you my diseases.\n\n[Exit.]",
