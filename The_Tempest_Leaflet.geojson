Speak to the mariners: fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Mariners.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nHeigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare!

To cabin! silence! Trouble us not.\n\nGONZALO.\nGood, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nNone that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more.

    "content":"SCENE II. The Island. Before the cell of Prospero.\nEnter Prospero and Miranda.\n\nMIRANDA.\nIf by your art, my dearest father, you have\nPut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\nThe sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\nBut that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,\nDashes the fire out. O! I have suffered\nWith those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,\nWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\nDash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\nAgainst my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.\nHad I been any god of power, I would\nHave sunk the sea within the earth, or ere\nIt should the good ship so have swallow’d and\nThe fraughting souls within her.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBe collected:\nNo more amazement: tell your piteous heart\nThere’s no harm done.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, woe the day!\n\nPROSPERO.\nNo harm.\nI have done nothing but in care of thee,\nOf thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\nArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\nOf whence I am, nor that I am more better\nThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,\nAnd thy no greater father.\n\nMIRANDA.\nMore to know\nDid never meddle with my thoughts.\n\nPROSPERO.\n’Tis time\nI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\nAnd pluck my magic garment from me.—So:\n\n[Lays down his mantle.]\n\nLie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.\nThe direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch’d\nThe very virtue of compassion in thee,\nI have with such provision in mine art\nSo safely ordered that there is no soul—\nNo, not so much perdition as an hair\nBetid to any creature in the vessel\nWhich thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;\nFor thou must now know farther.\n\nMIRANDA.\nYou have often\nBegun to tell me what I am, but stopp’d,\nAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,\nConcluding “Stay; not yet.”\n\nPROSPERO.\nThe hour’s now come,\nThe very minute bids thee ope thine ear;\nObey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember\nA time before we came unto this cell?\nI do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not\nOut three years old.\n\nMIRANDA.\nCertainly, sir, I can.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBy what? By any other house, or person?\nOf anything the image, tell me, that\nHath kept with thy remembrance.\n\nMIRANDA.\n’Tis far off,\nAnd rather like a dream than an assurance\nThat my remembrance warrants. Had I not\nFour or five women once that tended me?\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\nThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\nIn the dark backward and abysm of time?\nIf thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here,\nHow thou cam’st here, thou mayst.\n\nMIRANDA.\nBut that I do not.\n\nPROSPERO.\nTwelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\nThy father was the Duke of Milan, and\nA prince of power.\n\nMIRANDA.\nSir, are not you my father?\n\nPROSPERO.\nThy mother was a piece of virtue, and\nShe said thou wast my daughter. And thy father\nWas Duke of Milan, and his only heir\nAnd princess, no worse issued.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, the heavens!\nWhat foul play had we that we came from thence?\nOr blessed was’t we did?\n\nPROSPERO.\nBoth, both, my girl.\nBy foul play, as thou say’st, were we heav’d thence;\nBut blessedly holp hither.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, my heart bleeds\nTo think o’ th’ teen that I have turn’d you to,\nWhich is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.\n\nPROSPERO.\nMy brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio—\nI pray thee, mark me, that a brother should\nBe so perfidious!—he whom next thyself\nOf all the world I lov’d, and to him put\nThe manage of my state; as at that time\nThrough all the signories it was the first,\nAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\nIn dignity, and for the liberal arts,\nWithout a parallel: those being all my study,\nThe government I cast upon my brother,\nAnd to my state grew stranger, being transported\nAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—\nDost thou attend me?\n\nMIRANDA.\nSir, most heedfully.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBeing once perfected how to grant suits,\nHow to deny them, who t’ advance, and who\nTo trash for over-topping, new created\nThe creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ’em,\nOr else new form’d ’em: having both the key\nOf officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state\nTo what tune pleas’d his ear: that now he was\nThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,\nAnd suck’d my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, good sir! I do.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI pray thee, mark me.\nI, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\nTo closeness and the bettering of my mind\nWith that which, but by being so retir’d,\nO’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother\nAwak’d an evil nature; and my trust,\nLike a good parent, did beget of him\nA falsehood in its contrary as great\nAs my trust was; which had indeed no limit,\nA confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\nNot only with what my revenue yielded,\nBut what my power might else exact, like one\nWho having into truth, by telling of it,\nMade such a sinner of his memory,\nTo credit his own lie, he did believe\nHe was indeed the Duke; out o’ the substitution,\nAnd executing th’ outward face of royalty,\nWith all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—\nDost thou hear?\n\nMIRANDA.\nYour tale, sir, would cure deafness.\n\nPROSPERO.\nTo have no screen between this part he play’d\nAnd him he play’d it for, he needs will be\nAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library\nWas dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties\nHe thinks me now incapable; confederates,\nSo dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples\nTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,\nSubject his coronet to his crown, and bend\nThe dukedom, yet unbow’d—alas, poor Milan!—\nTo most ignoble stooping.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO the heavens!\n\nPROSPERO.\nMark his condition, and the event; then tell me\nIf this might be a brother.\n\nMIRANDA.\nI should sin\nTo think but nobly of my grandmother:\nGood wombs have borne bad sons.\n\nPROSPERO.\nNow the condition.\nThis King of Naples, being an enemy\nTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;\nWhich was, that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises\nOf homage and I know not how much tribute,\nShould presently extirpate me and mine\nOut of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,\nWith all the honours on my brother: whereon,\nA treacherous army levied, one midnight\nFated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open\nThe gates of Milan; and, i’ th’ dead of darkness,\nThe ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence\nMe and thy crying self.\n\nMIRANDA.\nAlack, for pity!\nI, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,\nWill cry it o’er again: it is a hint\nThat wrings mine eyes to ’t.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHear a little further,\nAnd then I’ll bring thee to the present business\nWhich now’s upon us; without the which this story\nWere most impertinent.\n\nMIRANDA.\nWherefore did they not\nThat hour destroy us?\n\nPROSPERO.\nWell demanded, wench:\nMy tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,\nSo dear the love my people bore me, nor set\nA mark so bloody on the business; but\nWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.\nIn few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\nBore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared\nA rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d,\nNor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\nInstinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,\nTo cry to th’ sea, that roar’d to us; to sigh\nTo th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,\nDid us but loving wrong.\n\nMIRANDA.\nAlack, what trouble\nWas I then to you!\n\nPROSPERO.\nO, a cherubin\nThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,\nInfused with a fortitude from heaven,\nWhen I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,\nUnder my burden groan’d: which rais’d in me\nAn undergoing stomach, to bear up\nAgainst what should ensue.\n\nMIRANDA.\nHow came we ashore?\n\nPROSPERO.\nBy Providence divine.\nSome food we had and some fresh water that\nA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\nOut of his charity, who being then appointed\nMaster of this design, did give us, with\nRich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,\nWhich since have steaded much: so, of his gentleness,\nKnowing I lov’d my books, he furnish’d me\nFrom mine own library with volumes that\nI prize above my dukedom.\n\nMIRANDA.\nWould I might\nBut ever see that man!\n\nPROSPERO.\nNow I arise.\nSit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.\nHere in this island we arriv’d; and here\nHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\nThan other princes can, that have more time\nFor vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.\n\nMIRANDA.\nHeavens thank you for ’t! And now, I pray you, sir,\nFor still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason\nFor raising this sea-storm?\n\nPROSPERO.\nKnow thus far forth.\nBy accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\nNow my dear lady, hath mine enemies\nBrought to this shore; and by my prescience\nI find my zenith doth depend upon\nA most auspicious star, whose influence\nIf now I court not but omit, my fortunes\nWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions;\nThou art inclin’d to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,\nAnd give it way. I know thou canst not choose.\n\n[Miranda sleeps.]\n\nCome away, servant, come! I am ready now.\nApproach, my Ariel. Come!\n\nEnter Ariel.\n\nARIEL.\nAll hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come\nTo answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,\nTo swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\nOn the curl’d clouds, to thy strong bidding task\nAriel and all his quality.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHast thou, spirit,\nPerform’d to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n\nARIEL.\nTo every article.\nI boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak,\nNow in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\nI flam’d amazement; sometime I’d divide,\nAnd burn in many places; on the topmast,\nThe yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\nThen meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors\nO’ th’ dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\nAnd sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks\nOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\nSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,\nYea, his dread trident shake.\n\nPROSPERO.\nMy brave spirit!\nWho was so firm, so constant, that this coil\nWould not infect his reason?\n\nARIEL.\nNot a soul\nBut felt a fever of the mad, and play’d\nSome tricks of desperation. All but mariners\nPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,\nThen all afire with me: the King’s son, Ferdinand,\nWith hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair—\nWas the first man that leapt; cried “Hell is empty,\nAnd all the devils are here.”\n\nPROSPERO.\nWhy, that’s my spirit!\nBut was not this nigh shore?\n\nARIEL.\nClose by, my master.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBut are they, Ariel, safe?\n\nARIEL.\nNot a hair perish’d;\nOn their sustaining garments not a blemish,\nBut fresher than before: and, as thou bad’st me,\nIn troops I have dispers’d them ’bout the isle.\nThe King’s son have I landed by himself,\nWhom I left cooling of the air with sighs\nIn an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,\nHis arms in this sad knot.\n\nPROSPERO.\nOf the King’s ship\nThe mariners, say how thou hast dispos’d,\nAnd all the rest o’ th’ fleet?\n\nARIEL.\nSafely in harbour\nIs the King’s ship; in the deep nook, where once\nThou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\nFrom the still-vex’d Bermoothes; there she’s hid:\nThe mariners all under hatches stowed;\nWho, with a charm join’d to their suff’red labour,\nI have left asleep: and for the rest o’ th’ fleet,\nWhich I dispers’d, they all have met again,\nAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote\nBound sadly home for Naples,\nSupposing that they saw the King’s ship wrack’d,\nAnd his great person perish.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAriel, thy charge\nExactly is perform’d; but there’s more work.\nWhat is the time o’ th’ day?\n\nARIEL.\nPast the mid season.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAt least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now\nMust by us both be spent most preciously.\n\nARIEL.\nIs there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,\nLet me remember thee what thou hast promis’d,\nWhich is not yet perform’d me.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHow now! moody?\nWhat is’t thou canst demand?\n\nARIEL.\nMy liberty.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBefore the time be out? No more!\n\nARIEL.\nI prithee,\nRemember I have done thee worthy service;\nTold thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv’d\nWithout or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise\nTo bate me a full year.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDost thou forget\nFrom what a torment I did free thee?\n\nARIEL.\nNo.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze\nOf the salt deep,\nTo run upon the sharp wind of the north,\nTo do me business in the veins o’ th’ earth\nWhen it is bak’d with frost.\n\nARIEL.\nI do not, sir.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot\nThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy\nWas grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?\n\nARIEL.\nNo, sir.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou hast. Where was she born? Speak; tell me.\n\nARIEL.\nSir, in Argier.\n\nPROSPERO.\nO, was she so? I must\nOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,\nWhich thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,\nFor mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible\nTo enter human hearing, from Argier,\nThou know’st, was banish’d: for one thing she did\nThey would not take her life. Is not this true?\n\nARIEL.\nAy, sir.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThis blue-ey’d hag was hither brought with child,\nAnd here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave,\nAs thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant;\nAnd, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\nTo act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,\nRefusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\nBy help of her more potent ministers,\nAnd in her most unmitigable rage,\nInto a cloven pine; within which rift\nImprison’d, thou didst painfully remain\nA dozen years; within which space she died,\nAnd left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans\nAs fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island—\nSave for the son that she did litter here,\nA freckl’d whelp, hag-born—not honour’d with\nA human shape.\n\nARIEL.\nYes, Caliban her son.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,\nWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st\nWhat torment I did find thee in; thy groans\nDid make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts\nOf ever-angry bears: it was a torment\nTo lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax\nCould not again undo; it was mine art,\nWhen I arriv’d and heard thee, that made gape\nThe pine, and let thee out.\n\nARIEL.\nI thank thee, master.\n\nPROSPERO.\nIf thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak\nAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails till\nThou hast howl’d away twelve winters.\n\nARIEL.\nPardon, master:\nI will be correspondent to command,\nAnd do my spriting gently.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDo so; and after two days\nI will discharge thee.\n\nARIEL.\nThat’s my noble master!\nWhat shall I do? Say what? What shall I do?\n\nPROSPERO.\nGo make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea. Be subject\nTo no sight but thine and mine; invisible\nTo every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,\nAnd hither come in ’t. Go, hence with diligence!\n\n[Exit Ariel.]\n\nAwake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;\nAwake!\n\nMIRANDA.\n[Waking.] The strangeness of your story put\nHeaviness in me.\n\nPROSPERO.\nShake it off. Come on;\nWe’ll visit Caliban my slave, who never\nYields us kind answer.\n\nMIRANDA.\n’Tis a villain, sir,\nI do not love to look on.\n\nPROSPERO.\nBut as ’tis,\nWe cannot miss him: he does make our fire,\nFetch in our wood; and serves in offices\nThat profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!\nThou earth, thou! Speak.\n\nCALIBAN.\n[Within.] There’s wood enough within.\n\nPROSPERO.\nCome forth, I say; there’s other business for thee.\nCome, thou tortoise! when?\n\nRe-enter Ariel like a water-nymph.\n\nFine apparition! My quaint Ariel,\nHark in thine ear.\n\nARIEL.\nMy lord, it shall be done.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself\nUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!\n\nEnter Caliban.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAs wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d\nWith raven’s feather from unwholesome fen\nDrop on you both! A south-west blow on ye,\nAnd blister you all o’er!\n\nPROSPERO.\nFor this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,\nSide-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins\nShall forth at vast of night that they may work\nAll exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinch’d\nAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\nThan bees that made them.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI must eat my dinner.\nThis island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother,\nWhich thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,\nThou strok’st me and made much of me; wouldst give me\nWater with berries in ’t; and teach me how\nTo name the bigger light, and how the less,\nThat burn by day and night: and then I lov’d thee,\nAnd show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,\nThe fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile.\nCurs’d be I that did so! All the charms\nOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!\nFor I am all the subjects that you have,\nWhich first was mine own King; and here you sty me\nIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\nThe rest o’ th’ island.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou most lying slave,\nWhom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us’d thee,\nFilth as thou art, with human care, and lodg’d thee\nIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\nThe honour of my child.\n\nCALIBAN.\nOh ho! Oh ho! Would ’t had been done!\nThou didst prevent me; I had peopled else\nThis isle with Calibans.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAbhorred slave,\nWhich any print of goodness wilt not take,\nBeing capable of all ill! I pitied thee,\nTook pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour\nOne thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,\nKnow thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like\nA thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes\nWith words that made them known. But thy vile race,\nThough thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures\nCould not abide to be with; therefore wast thou\nDeservedly confin’d into this rock,\nWho hadst deserv’d more than a prison.\n\nCALIBAN.\nYou taught me language, and my profit on ’t\nIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you,\nFor learning me your language!\n\nPROSPERO.\nHag-seed, hence!\nFetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou ’rt best,\nTo answer other business. Shrug’st thou, malice?\nIf thou neglect’st, or dost unwillingly\nWhat I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,\nFill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,\nThat beasts shall tremble at thy din.\n\nCALIBAN.\nNo, pray thee.\n[Aside.] I must obey. His art is of such power,\nIt would control my dam’s god, Setebos,\nAnd make a vassal of him.\n\nPROSPERO.\nSo, slave, hence!\n\n[Exit Caliban.]\n\nRe-enter Ariel, playing and singing; Ferdinand following.\n\nARIEL’S SONG.\n\nCome unto these yellow sands,\n    And then take hands:\nCurtsied when you have, and kiss’d\n    The wild waves whist.\nFoot it featly here and there,\n    And sweet sprites bear\nThe burden. Hark, hark!\n    Burden dispersedly. Bow-wow.\nThe watch dogs bark.\n    [Burden dispersedly.] Bow-wow.\nHark, hark! I hear\nThe strain of strutting chanticleer\n    Cry cock-a-diddle-dow.\n\nFERDINAND.\nWhere should this music be? i’ th’ air or th’ earth?\nIt sounds no more; and sure it waits upon\nSome god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,\nWeeping again the King my father’s wrack,\nThis music crept by me upon the waters,\nAllaying both their fury and my passion\nWith its sweet air: thence I have follow’d it,\nOr it hath drawn me rather,—but ’tis gone.\nNo, it begins again.\n\nARIEL.\n[Sings.]\nFull fathom five thy father lies.\n    Of his bones are coral made.\nThose are pearls that were his eyes.\n    Nothing of him that doth fade\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\nInto something rich and strange.\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\n    Burden: Ding-dong.\nHark! now I hear them: ding-dong, bell.\n\nFERDINAND.\nThe ditty does remember my drown’d father.\nThis is no mortal business, nor no sound\nThat the earth owes:—I hear it now above me.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThe fringed curtains of thine eye advance,\nAnd say what thou seest yond.\n\nMIRANDA.\nWhat is’t? a spirit?\nLord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,\nIt carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.\n\nPROSPERO.\nNo, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses\nAs we have, such. This gallant which thou seest\nWas in the wrack; and, but he’s something stain’d\nWith grief,—that’s beauty’s canker,—thou mightst call him\nA goodly person: he hath lost his fellows\nAnd strays about to find ’em.\n\nMIRANDA.\nI might call him\nA thing divine; for nothing natural\nI ever saw so noble.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside.] It goes on, I see,\nAs my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I’ll free thee\nWithin two days for this.\n\nFERDINAND.\nMost sure, the goddess\nOn whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe, my prayer\nMay know if you remain upon this island;\nAnd that you will some good instruction give\nHow I may bear me here: my prime request,\nWhich I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!\nIf you be maid or no?\n\nMIRANDA.\nNo wonder, sir;\nBut certainly a maid.\n\nFERDINAND.\nMy language! Heavens!\nI am the best of them that speak this speech,\nWere I but where ’tis spoken.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHow! the best?\nWhat wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?\n\nFERDINAND.\nA single thing, as I am now, that wonders\nTo hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;\nAnd that he does I weep: myself am Naples,\nWho with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld\nThe King my father wrack’d.\n\nMIRANDA.\nAlack, for mercy!\n\nFERDINAND.\nYes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan,\nAnd his brave son being twain.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside.] The Duke of Milan\nAnd his more braver daughter could control thee,\nIf now ’twere fit to do’t. At the first sight\nThey have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,\nI’ll set thee free for this. [To Ferdinand.] A word, good sir.\nI fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.\n\nMIRANDA.\nWhy speaks my father so ungently? This\nIs the third man that e’er I saw; the first\nThat e’er I sigh’d for. Pity move my father\nTo be inclin’d my way!\n\nFERDINAND.\nO! if a virgin,\nAnd your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you\nThe Queen of Naples.\n\nPROSPERO.\nSoft, sir; one word more.\n[Aside.] They are both in either’s powers. But this swift business\nI must uneasy make, lest too light winning\nMake the prize light. [To Ferdinand.] One word more. I charge thee\nThat thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp\nThe name thou ow’st not; and hast put thyself\nUpon this island as a spy, to win it\nFrom me, the lord on ’t.\n\nFERDINAND.\nNo, as I am a man.\n\nMIRANDA.\nThere’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:\nIf the ill spirit have so fair a house,\nGood things will strive to dwell with ’t.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[To Ferdinand.] Follow me.—\n[To Miranda.] Speak not you for him; he’s a traitor.\n[To Ferdinand.] Come;\nI’ll manacle thy neck and feet together:\nSea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be\nThe fresh-brook mussels, wither’d roots, and husks\nWherein the acorn cradled. Follow.\n\nFERDINAND.\nNo;\nI will resist such entertainment till\nMine enemy has more power.\n\n[He draws, and is charmed from moving.]\n\nMIRANDA.\nO dear father!\nMake not too rash a trial of him, for\nHe’s gentle, and not fearful.\n\nPROSPERO.\nWhat! I say,\nMy foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;\nWho mak’st a show, but dar’st not strike, thy conscience\nIs so possess’d with guilt: come from thy ward,\nFor I can here disarm thee with this stick\nAnd make thy weapon drop.\n\nMIRANDA.\nBeseech you, father!\n\nPROSPERO.\nHence! Hang not on my garments.\n\nMIRANDA.\nSir, have pity;\nI’ll be his surety.\n\nPROSPERO.\nSilence! One word more\nShall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!\nAn advocate for an impostor? hush!\nThou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,\nHaving seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!\nTo th’ most of men this is a Caliban,\nAnd they to him are angels.\n\nMIRANDA.\nMy affections\nAre then most humble; I have no ambition\nTo see a goodlier man.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[To Ferdinand.] Come on; obey:\nThy nerves are in their infancy again,\nAnd have no vigour in them.\n\nFERDINAND.\nSo they are:\nMy spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.\nMy father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,\nThe wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats,\nTo whom I am subdued, are but light to me,\nMight I but through my prison once a day\nBehold this maid: all corners else o’ th’ earth\nLet liberty make use of; space enough\nHave I in such a prison.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside.] It works. [To Ferdinand.] Come on.\nThou hast done well, fine Ariel! [To Ferdinand.] Follow me.\n[To Ariel.] Hark what thou else shalt do me.\n\nMIRANDA.\nBe of comfort;\nMy father’s of a better nature, sir,\nThan he appears by speech: this is unwonted\nWhich now came from him.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou shalt be as free\nAs mountain winds; but then exactly do\nAll points of my command.\n\nARIEL.\nTo th’ syllable.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[To Ferdinand.] Come, follow. Speak not for him.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT II\nSCENE I. Another part of the island.\nEnter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco and others.\n\nGONZALO.\nBeseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,\nSo have we all, of joy; for our escape\nIs much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe\nIs common; every day, some sailor’s wife,\nThe masters of some merchant and the merchant,\nHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\nI mean our preservation, few in millions\nCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh\nOur sorrow with our comfort.\n\nALONSO.\nPrithee, peace.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe receives comfort like cold porridge.\n\nANTONIO.\nThe visitor will not give him o’er so.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nLook, he’s winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike.\n\nGONZALO.\nSir,—\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nOne: tell.\n\nGONZALO.\nWhen every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d,\nComes to the entertainer—\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA dollar.\n\nGONZALO.\nDolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than you purposed.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nYou have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.\n\nGONZALO.\nTherefore, my lord,—\n\nANTONIO.\nFie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\n\nALONSO.\nI prithee, spare.\n\nGONZALO.\nWell, I have done: but yet—\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe will be talking.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhich, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nThe old cock.\n\nANTONIO.\nThe cockerel.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nDone. The wager?\n\nANTONIO.\nA laughter.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA match!\n\nADRIAN.\nThough this island seem to be desert,—\n\nANTONIO.\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nSo. You’re paid.\n\nADRIAN.\nUninhabitable, and almost inaccessible,—\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nYet—\n\nADRIAN.\nYet—\n\nANTONIO.\nHe could not miss ’t.\n\nADRIAN.\nIt must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.\n\nANTONIO.\nTemperance was a delicate wench.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAy, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.\n\nADRIAN.\nThe air breathes upon us here most sweetly.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAs if it had lungs, and rotten ones.\n\nANTONIO.\nOr, as ’twere perfum’d by a fen.\n\nGONZALO.\nHere is everything advantageous to life.\n\nANTONIO.\nTrue; save means to live.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nOf that there’s none, or little.\n\nGONZALO.\nHow lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!\n\nANTONIO.\nThe ground indeed is tawny.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWith an eye of green in’t.\n\nANTONIO.\nHe misses not much.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nNo; he doth but mistake the truth totally.\n\nGONZALO.\nBut the rarity of it is,—which is indeed almost beyond credit,—\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAs many vouch’d rarities are.\n\nGONZALO.\nThat our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.\n\nANTONIO.\nIf but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAy, or very falsely pocket up his report.\n\nGONZALO.\nMethinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.\n\nADRIAN.\nTunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their Queen.\n\nGONZALO.\nNot since widow Dido’s time.\n\nANTONIO.\nWidow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow in? Widow Dido!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat if he had said, widower Aeneas too?\nGood Lord, how you take it!\n\nADRIAN.\nWidow Dido said you? You make me study of that; she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.\n\nGONZALO.\nThis Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\n\nADRIAN.\nCarthage?\n\nGONZALO.\nI assure you, Carthage.\n\nANTONIO.\nHis word is more than the miraculous harp.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe hath rais’d the wall, and houses too.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhat impossible matter will he make easy next?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son for an apple.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.\n\nALONSO.\nAy.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhy, in good time.\n\nGONZALO.\n[To Alonso.] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now Queen.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd the rarest that e’er came there.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\n\nANTONIO.\nO! widow Dido; ay, widow Dido.\n\nGONZALO.\nIs not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.\n\nANTONIO.\nThat sort was well fish’d for.\n\nGONZALO.\nWhen I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?\n\nALONSO.\nYou cram these words into mine ears against\nThe stomach of my sense. Would I had never\nMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,\nMy son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,\nWho is so far from Italy removed,\nI ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\nHath made his meal on thee?\n\nFRANCISCO.\nSir, he may live:\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\nAnd ride upon their backs. He trod the water,\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\nThe surge most swoln that met him. His bold head\n’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\nTo th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,\nAs stooping to relieve him. I not doubt\nHe came alive to land.\n\nALONSO.\nNo, no, he’s gone.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\nBut rather lose her to an African;\nWhere she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,\nWho hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.\n\nALONSO.\nPrithee, peace.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nYou were kneel’d to, and importun’d otherwise\nBy all of us; and the fair soul herself\nWeigh’d between loathness and obedience at\nWhich end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,\nI fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\nMore widows in them of this business’ making,\nThan we bring men to comfort them.\nThe fault’s your own.\n\nALONSO.\nSo is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.\n\nGONZALO.\nMy lord Sebastian,\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness\nAnd time to speak it in. You rub the sore,\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nVery well.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd most chirurgeonly.\n\nGONZALO.\nIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,\nWhen you are cloudy.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nFoul weather?\n\nANTONIO.\nVery foul.\n\nGONZALO.\nHad I plantation of this isle, my lord,—\n\nANTONIO.\nHe’d sow ’t with nettle-seed.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nOr docks, or mallows.\n\nGONZALO.\nAnd were the King on’t, what would I do?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n’Scape being drunk for want of wine.\n\nGONZALO.\nI’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries\nExecute all things; for no kind of traffic\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\nNo occupation; all men idle, all;\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\nNo sovereignty,—\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nYet he would be King on’t.\n\nANTONIO.\nThe latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.\n\nGONZALO.\nAll things in common nature should produce\nWithout sweat or endeavour; treason, felony,\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth,\nOf it own kind, all foison, all abundance,\nTo feed my innocent people.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nNo marrying ’mong his subjects?\n\nANTONIO.\nNone, man; all idle; whores and knaves.\n\nGONZALO.\nI would with such perfection govern, sir,\nT’ excel the Golden Age.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nSave his Majesty!\n\nANTONIO.\nLong live Gonzalo!\n\nGONZALO.\nAnd,—do you mark me, sir?\n\nALONSO.\nPrithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\n\nGONZALO.\nI do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.\n\nANTONIO.\n’Twas you we laughed at.\n\nGONZALO.\nWho in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.\n\nANTONIO.\nWhat a blow was there given!\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nAn it had not fallen flat-long.\n\nGONZALO.\nYou are gentlemen of brave mettle. You would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.\n\nEnter Ariel, invisible, playing solemn music.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWe would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.\n\nANTONIO.\nNay, good my lord, be not angry.\n\nGONZALO.\nNo, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?\n\nANTONIO.\nGo sleep, and hear us.\n\n[All sleep but Alonso, Sebastian and Antonio.]\n\nALONSO.\nWhat, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\nWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find\nThey are inclin’d to do so.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nPlease you, sir,\nDo not omit the heavy offer of it:\nIt seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\nIt is a comforter.\n\nANTONIO.\nWe two, my lord,\nWill guard your person while you take your rest,\nAnd watch your safety.\n\nALONSO.\nThank you. Wondrous heavy!\n\n[Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel.]\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!\n\nANTONIO.\nIt is the quality o’ th’ climate.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhy\nDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\nMyself dispos’d to sleep.\n\nANTONIO.\nNor I. My spirits are nimble.\nThey fell together all, as by consent;\nThey dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might?—No more.\nAnd yet methinks I see it in thy face,\nWhat thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee; and\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\nDropping upon thy head.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat, art thou waking?\n\nANTONIO.\nDo you not hear me speak?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI do; and surely\nIt is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\nWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\n\nANTONIO.\nNoble Sebastian,\nThou let’st thy fortune sleep—die rather; wink’st\nWhiles thou art waking.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nThou dost snore distinctly:\nThere’s meaning in thy snores.\n\nANTONIO.\nI am more serious than my custom; you\nMust be so too, if heed me; which to do\nTrebles thee o’er.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWell, I am standing water.\n\nANTONIO.\nI’ll teach you how to flow.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nDo so: to ebb,\nHereditary sloth instructs me.\n\nANTONIO.\nO,\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish\nWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,\nYou more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,\nMost often, do so near the bottom run\nBy their own fear or sloth.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nPrithee, say on:\nThe setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim\nA matter from thee, and a birth, indeed\nWhich throes thee much to yield.\n\nANTONIO.\nThus, sir:\nAlthough this lord of weak remembrance, this\nWho shall be of as little memory\nWhen he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,—\nFor he’s a spirit of persuasion, only\nProfesses to persuade,—the King his son’s alive,\n’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d\nAs he that sleeps here swims.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI have no hope\nThat he’s undrown’d.\n\nANTONIO.\nO, out of that “no hope”\nWhat great hope have you! No hope that way is\nAnother way so high a hope, that even\nAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\nBut doubts discovery there. Will you grant with me\nThat Ferdinand is drown’d?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe’s gone.\n\nANTONIO.\nThen tell me,\nWho’s the next heir of Naples?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nClaribel.\n\nANTONIO.\nShe that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells\nTen leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples\nCan have no note, unless the sun were post—\nThe Man i’ th’ Moon’s too slow—till newborn chins\nBe rough and razorable; she that from whom\nWe all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,\nAnd by that destiny, to perform an act\nWhereof what’s past is prologue, what to come\nIn yours and my discharge.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhat stuff is this! How say you?\n’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis;\nSo is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions\nThere is some space.\n\nANTONIO.\nA space whose ev’ry cubit\nSeems to cry out “How shall that Claribel\nMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,\nAnd let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death\nThat now hath seiz’d them; why, they were no worse\nThan now they are. There be that can rule Naples\nAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate\nAs amply and unnecessarily\nAs this Gonzalo. I myself could make\nA chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\nThe mind that I do! What a sleep were this\nFor your advancement! Do you understand me?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nMethinks I do.\n\nANTONIO.\nAnd how does your content\nTender your own good fortune?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nI remember\nYou did supplant your brother Prospero.\n\nANTONIO.\nTrue.\nAnd look how well my garments sit upon me;\nMuch feater than before; my brother’s servants\nWere then my fellows; now they are my men.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBut, for your conscience.\n\nANTONIO.\nAy, sir; where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,\n’Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not\nThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences\nThat stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they\nAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\nNo better than the earth he lies upon,\nIf he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead;\nWhom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\nCan lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,\nTo the perpetual wink for aye might put\nThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\nShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\nThey’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.\nThey’ll tell the clock to any business that\nWe say befits the hour.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nThy case, dear friend,\nShall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan,\nI’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke\nShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,\nAnd I the King shall love thee.\n\nANTONIO.\nDraw together,\nAnd when I rear my hand, do you the like,\nTo fall it on Gonzalo.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nO, but one word.\n\n[They converse apart.]\n\nMusic. Re-enter Ariel, invisible.\n\nARIEL.\nMy master through his art foresees the danger\nThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth—\nFor else his project dies—to keep them living.\n\n[Sings in Gonzalo’s ear.]\nWhile you here do snoring lie,\nOpen-ey’d conspiracy\n    His time doth take.\nIf of life you keep a care,\nShake off slumber, and beware.\n    Awake! awake!\n\nANTONIO.\nThen let us both be sudden.\n\nGONZALO.\nNow, good angels\nPreserve the King!\n\n[They wake.]\n\nALONSO.\nWhy, how now! Ho, awake! Why are you drawn?\nWherefore this ghastly looking?\n\nGONZALO.\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhiles we stood here securing your repose,\nEven now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing\nLike bulls, or rather lions; did ’t not wake you?\nIt struck mine ear most terribly.\n\nALONSO.\nI heard nothing.\n\nANTONIO.\nO! ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,\nTo make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar\nOf a whole herd of lions.\n\nALONSO.\nHeard you this, Gonzalo?\n\nGONZALO.\nUpon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,\nAnd that a strange one too, which did awake me.\nI shak’d you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open’d,\nI saw their weapons drawn:—there was a noise,\nThat’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,\nOr that we quit this place: let’s draw our weapons.\n\nALONSO.\nLead off this ground, and let’s make further search\nFor my poor son.\n\nGONZALO.\nHeavens keep him from these beasts!\nFor he is, sure, i’ th’ island.\n\nALONSO.\nLead away.\n\n[Exit with the others.]\n\nARIEL.\nProspero my lord shall know what I have done:\nSo, King, go safely on to seek thy son.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Another part of the island.\nEnter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAll the infections that the sun sucks up\nFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him\nBy inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,\nAnd yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,\nFright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ the mire,\nNor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark\nOut of my way, unless he bid ’em; but\nFor every trifle are they set upon me,\nSometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,\nAnd after bite me; then like hedgehogs which\nLie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount\nTheir pricks at my footfall; sometime am I\nAll wound with adders, who with cloven tongues\nDo hiss me into madness.\n\nEnter Trinculo.\n\nLo, now, lo!\nHere comes a spirit of his, and to torment me\nFor bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat;\nPerchance he will not mind me.\n\nTRINCULO.\nHere’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg’d like a man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by thunderbolt. [Thunder.] Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.\n\nEnter Stephano singing; a bottle in his hand.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI shall no more to sea, to sea,\nHere shall I die ashore—\n\nThis is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.\nWell, here’s my comfort.\n\n[Drinks.]\n\nThe master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,\n    The gunner, and his mate,\nLov’d Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,\n    But none of us car’d for Kate:\n    For she had a tongue with a tang,\n    Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!”\nShe lov’d not the savour of tar nor of pitch,\nYet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.\n    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang.\n\nThis is a scurvy tune too: but here’s my comfort.\n\n[Drinks.]\n\nCALIBAN.\nDo not torment me: O!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nWhat’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind? Ha? I have not scap’d drowning, to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at’ nostrils.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThe spirit torments me: O!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThis is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him and keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s-leather.\n\nCALIBAN.\nDo not torment me, prithee; I’ll bring my wood home faster.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHe’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him. He shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,\nI know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome on your ways. Open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat. Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly. [gives Caliban a drink] You cannot tell who’s your friend: open your chaps again.\n\nTRINCULO.\nI should know that voice: it should be—but he is drowned; and these are devils. O, defend me!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nFour legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth.\n\nTRINCULO.\nStephano!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDoth thy other mouth call me? Mercy! mercy!\nThis is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I\nhave no long spoon.\n\nTRINCULO.\nStephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo—be not afeared—thy good friend Trinculo.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nIf thou beest Trinculo, come forth. I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How cam’st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent Trinculos?\n\nTRINCULO.\nI took him to be kill’d with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drown’d, Stephano? I hope now thou are not drown’d. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the dead moon-calf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scap’d!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nPrithee, do not turn me about. My stomach is not constant.\n\nCALIBAN.\n[Aside.] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.\nThat’s a brave god, and bears celestial liquor.\nI will kneel to him.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHow didst thou scape? How cam’st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou cam’st hither—I escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o’erboard, by this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands, since I was cast ashore.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is not earthly.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHere. Swear then how thou escapedst.\n\nTRINCULO.\nSwum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I’ll be sworn.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHere, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.\n\nTRINCULO.\nO Stephano, hast any more of this?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThe whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by th’ seaside, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf! How does thine ague?\n\nCALIBAN.\nHast thou not dropped from heaven?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nOut o’ the moon, I do assure thee: I was the Man in the Moon, when time was.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will furnish it anon with new contents. Swear.\n\nTRINCULO.\nBy this good light, this is a very shallow monster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The Man i’ the Moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!\n\nCALIBAN.\nI’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ the island; and I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.\n\nTRINCULO.\nBy this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster. When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI’ll kiss thy foot. I’ll swear myself thy subject.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome on, then; down, and swear.\n\nTRINCULO.\nI shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,—\n\nSTEPHANO.\nCome, kiss.\n\nTRINCULO.\nBut that the poor monster’s in drink. An abominable monster!\n\nCALIBAN.\nI’ll show thee the best springs; I’ll pluck thee berries;\nI’ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.\nA plague upon the tyrant that I serve!\nI’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,\nThou wondrous man.\n\nTRINCULO.\nA most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!\n\nCALIBAN.\nI prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;\nAnd I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;\nShow thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how\nTo snare the nimble marmoset; I’ll bring thee\nTo clustering filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee\nYoung scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI prithee now, lead the way without any more talking. Trinculo, the King and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here. Here, bear my bottle. Fellow Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.\n\nCALIBAN.\n[Sings drunkenly.] Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!\n\nTRINCULO.\nA howling monster, a drunken monster.\n\nCALIBAN.\nNo more dams I’ll make for fish;\nNor fetch in firing\nAt requiring,\nNor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish;\n’Ban ’Ban, Cacaliban,\nHas a new master—Get a new man.\nFreedom, high-day! high-day, freedom! freedom,\nhigh-day, freedom!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nO brave monster! lead the way.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

This my mean task\nWould be as heavy to me as odious, but\nThe mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead,\nAnd makes my labours pleasures: O, she is\nTen times more gentle than her father’s crabbed,\nAnd he’s compos’d of harshness. I must remove\nSome thousands of these logs, and pile them up,\nUpon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress\nWeeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness\nHad never like executor.

    "content":"SCENE II. Another part of the island.\nEnter Caliban with a bottle, Stephano and Trinculo.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTell not me:—when the butt is out we will drink water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and board ’em. Servant-monster, drink to me.\n\nTRINCULO.\nServant-monster! The folly of this island! They say there’s but five upon this isle; we are three of them; if th’ other two be brained like us, the state totters.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDrink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy head.\n\nTRINCULO.\nWhere should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMy man-monster hath drown’d his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues, off and on, by this light. Thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.\n\nTRINCULO.\nYour lieutenant, if you list; he’s no standard.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nWe’ll not run, Monsieur monster.\n\nTRINCULO.\nNor go neither. But you’ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMoon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.\n\nCALIBAN.\nHow does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I’ll not serve him, he is not valiant.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?\n\nCALIBAN.\nLo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?\n\nTRINCULO.\n“Lord” quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!\n\nCALIBAN.\nLo, lo again! bite him to death, I prithee.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTrinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer, the next tree! The poor monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas’d to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMarry. will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.\n\nEnter Ariel, invisible.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAs I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.\n\nARIEL.\nThou liest.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou;\nI would my valiant master would destroy thee;\nI do not lie.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTrinculo, if you trouble him any more in his tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.\n\nTRINCULO.\nWhy, I said nothing.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMum, then, and no more. Proceed.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI say, by sorcery he got this isle;\nFrom me he got it. If thy greatness will,\nRevenge it on him,—for I know thou dar’st;\nBut this thing dare not,—\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThat’s most certain.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHow now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party?\n\nCALIBAN.\nYea, yea, my lord: I’ll yield him thee asleep,\nWhere thou mayst knock a nail into his head.\n\nARIEL.\nThou liest. Thou canst not.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWhat a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!\nI do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,\nAnd take his bottle from him: when that’s gone\nHe shall drink nought but brine; for I’ll not show him\nWhere the quick freshes are.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nTrinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word further, and by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.\n\nTRINCULO.\nWhy, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go farther off.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDidst thou not say he lied?\n\nARIEL.\nThou liest.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nDo I so? Take thou that.\n\n[Strikes Trinculo.]\n\nAs you like this, give me the lie another time.\n\nTRINCULO.\nI did not give the lie. Out o’ your wits and hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!\n\nCALIBAN.\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nNow, forward with your tale.—Prithee stand further off.\n\nCALIBAN.\nBeat him enough: after a little time,\nI’ll beat him too.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nStand farther.—Come, proceed.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWhy, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him\nI’ th’ afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,\nHaving first seiz’d his books; or with a log\nBatter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,\nOr cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember\nFirst to possess his books; for without them\nHe’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\nOne spirit to command: they all do hate him\nAs rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\nHe has brave utensils,—for so he calls them,—\nWhich, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.\nAnd that most deeply to consider is\nThe beauty of his daughter; he himself\nCalls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman\nBut only Sycorax my dam and she;\nBut she as far surpasseth Sycorax\nAs great’st does least.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nIs it so brave a lass?\n\nCALIBAN.\nAy, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,\nAnd bring thee forth brave brood.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMonster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen,—save our graces!—and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?\n\nTRINCULO.\nExcellent.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nGive me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but while thou liv’st, keep a good tongue in thy head.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWithin this half hour will he be asleep.\nWilt thou destroy him then?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nAy, on mine honour.\n\nARIEL.\nThis will I tell my master.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThou mak’st me merry. I am full of pleasure.\nLet us be jocund: will you troll the catch\nYou taught me but while-ere?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nAt thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.\n\n[Sings.]\n\nFlout ’em and cout ’em,\nand scout ’em and flout ’em:\n    Thought is free.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThat’s not the tune.\n\n[Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.]\n\nSTEPHANO.\nWhat is this same?\n\nTRINCULO.\nThis is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nIf thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou beest a devil, take ’t as thou list.\n\nTRINCULO.\nO, forgive me my sins!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nHe that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!\n\nCALIBAN.\nArt thou afeard?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nNo, monster, not I.\n\nCALIBAN.\nBe not afeard. The isle is full of noises,\nSounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.\nSometimes a thousand twangling instruments\nWill hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,\nThat, if I then had wak’d after long sleep,\nWill make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,\nThe clouds methought would open and show riches\nReady to drop upon me; that, when I wak’d,\nI cried to dream again.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThis will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.\n\nCALIBAN.\nWhen Prospero is destroyed.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThat shall be by and by: I remember the story.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThe sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and after do our work.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nLead, monster: we’ll follow. I would I could see this taborer! he lays it on. Wilt come?\n\nTRINCULO.\nI’ll follow, Stephano.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

By your patience,\nI needs must rest me.\n\nALONSO.\nOld lord, I cannot blame thee,\nWho am myself attach’d with weariness\nTo th’ dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.\nEven here I will put off my hope, and keep it\nNo longer for my flatterer: he is drown’d\nWhom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks\nOur frustrate search on land.

My good friends, hark!\n\nGONZALO.\nMarvellous sweet music!\n\nALONSO.\nGive us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA living drollery. Now I will believe\nThat there are unicorns; that in Arabia\nThere is one tree, the phoenix’ throne; one phoenix\nAt this hour reigning there.\n\nANTONIO.\nI’ll believe both;\nAnd what does else want credit, come to me,\nAnd I’ll be sworn ’tis true: travellers ne’er did lie,\nThough fools at home condemn them.\n\nGONZALO.\nIf in Naples\nI should report this now, would they believe me?\nIf I should say, I saw such islanders,—\nFor, certes, these are people of the island,—\nWho, though, they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,\nTheir manners are more gentle, kind, than of\nOur human generation you shall find\nMany, nay, almost any.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside.] Honest lord,\nThou hast said well; for some of you there present\nAre worse than devils.\n\nALONSO.\nI cannot too much muse\nSuch shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing—\nAlthough they want the use of tongue—a kind\nOf excellent dumb discourse.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside.] Praise in departing.\n\nFRANCISCO.\nThey vanish’d strangely.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nNo matter, since\nThey have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.—\nWill’t please you taste of what is here?\n\nALONSO.\nNot I.\n\nGONZALO.\nFaith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,\nWho would believe that there were mountaineers\nDewlapp’d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em\nWallets of flesh? Or that there were such men\nWhose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find\nEach putter-out of five for one will bring us\nGood warrant of.\n\nALONSO.\nI will stand to, and feed,\nAlthough my last, no matter, since I feel\nThe best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,\nStand to, and do as we.\n\nThunder and lightning. Enter Ariel like a Harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes.\n\nARIEL.\nYou are three men of sin, whom Destiny,\nThat hath to instrument this lower world\nAnd what is in’t,—the never-surfeited sea\nHath caused to belch up you; and on this island\nWhere man doth not inhabit; you ’mongst men\nBeing most unfit to live. I have made you mad;\nAnd even with such-like valour men hang and drown\nTheir proper selves.\n\n[Seeing Alonso, Sebastian &c., draw their swords.]\n\nYou fools! I and my fellows\nAre ministers of Fate: the elements\nOf whom your swords are temper’d may as well\nWound the loud winds, or with bemock’d-at stabs\nKill the still-closing waters, as diminish\nOne dowle that’s in my plume. My fellow-ministers\nAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,\nYour swords are now too massy for your strengths,\nAnd will not be uplifted. But, remember—\nFor that’s my business to you,—that you three\nFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero;\nExpos’d unto the sea, which hath requit it,\nHim and his innocent child: for which foul deed\nThe powers, delaying, not forgetting, have\nIncens’d the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,\nAgainst your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,\nThey have bereft; and do pronounce, by me\nLing’ring perdition,—worse than any death\nCan be at once,—shall step by step attend\nYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from—\nWhich here, in this most desolate isle, else falls\nUpon your heads,—is nothing but heart-sorrow,\nAnd a clear life ensuing.\n\n[He vanishes in thunder: then, to soft music, enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carry out the table.]\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside.] Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou\nPerform’d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring.\nOf my instruction hast thou nothing bated\nIn what thou hadst to say: so, with good life\nAnd observation strange, my meaner ministers\nTheir several kinds have done. My high charms work,\nAnd these mine enemies are all knit up\nIn their distractions; they now are in my power;\nAnd in these fits I leave them, while I visit\nYoung Ferdinand,—whom they suppose is drown’d,—\nAnd his and mine lov’d darling.\n\n[Exit above.]\n\nGONZALO.\nI’ the name of something holy, sir, why stand you\nIn this strange stare?\n\nALONSO.\nO, it is monstrous! monstrous!\nMethought the billows spoke, and told me of it;\nThe winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,\nThat deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounc’d\nThe name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.\nTherefore my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded; and\nI’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,\nAnd with him there lie mudded.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nBut one fiend at a time,\nI’ll fight their legions o’er.\n\nANTONIO.\nI’ll be thy second.\n\n[Exeunt Sebastian and Antonio.]\n\nGONZALO.\nAll three of them are desperate: their great guilt,\nLike poison given to work a great time after,\nNow ’gins to bite the spirits.

Before Prospero’s cell.\nEnter Prospero, Ferdinand and Miranda.\n\nPROSPERO.\nIf I have too austerely punish’d you,\nYour compensation makes amends: for I\nHave given you here a third of mine own life,\nOr that for which I live; who once again\nI tender to thy hand: all thy vexations\nWere but my trials of thy love, and thou\nHast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,\nI ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,\nDo not smile at me that I boast her off,\nFor thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,\nAnd make it halt behind her.\n\nFERDINAND.\nI do believe it\nAgainst an oracle.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThen, as my gift and thine own acquisition\nWorthily purchas’d, take my daughter: but\nIf thou dost break her virgin knot before\nAll sanctimonious ceremonies may\nWith full and holy rite be minister’d,\nNo sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall\nTo make this contract grow; but barren hate,\nSour-ey’d disdain, and discord shall bestrew\nThe union of your bed with weeds so loathly\nThat you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,\nAs Hymen’s lamps shall light you.\n\nFERDINAND.\nAs I hope\nFor quiet days, fair issue, and long life,\nWith such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,\nThe most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion\nOur worser genius can, shall never melt\nMine honour into lust, to take away\nThe edge of that day’s celebration,\nWhen I shall think, or Phoebus’ steeds are founder’d,\nOr Night kept chain’d below.\n\nPROSPERO.\nFairly spoke:\nSit, then, and talk with her, she is thine own.\nWhat, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!\n\nEnter Ariel.\n\nARIEL.\nWhat would my potent master? here I am.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThou and thy meaner fellows your last service\nDid worthily perform; and I must use you\nIn such another trick. Go bring the rabble,\nO’er whom I give thee power, here to this place.\nIncite them to quick motion; for I must\nBestow upon the eyes of this young couple\nSome vanity of mine art: it is my promise,\nAnd they expect it from me.\n\nARIEL.\nPresently?\n\nPROSPERO.\nAy, with a twink.\n\nARIEL.\nBefore you can say “Come” and “Go,”\nAnd breathe twice, and cry “so, so,”\nEach one, tripping on his toe,\nWill be here with mop and mow.\nDo you love me, master? no?\n\nPROSPERO.\nDearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach\nTill thou dost hear me call.\n\nARIEL.\nWell, I conceive.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nLook thou be true; do not give dalliance\nToo much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw\nTo th’ fire i’ the blood: be more abstemious,\nOr else good night your vow!\n\nFERDINAND.\nI warrant you, sir;\nThe white cold virgin snow upon my heart\nAbates the ardour of my liver.\n\nPROSPERO.\nWell.\nNow come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,\nRather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly.\nNo tongue! all eyes! be silent.\n\n[Soft music.]\n\nA Masque. Enter Iris.\n\nIRIS.\nCeres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\nOf wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;\nThy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\nAnd flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep;\nThy banks with pioned and twilled brims,\nWhich spongy April at thy hest betrims,\nTo make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,\nWhose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\nBeing lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;\nAnd thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,\nWhere thou thyself dost air: the Queen o’ th’ sky,\nWhose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,\nBids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,\nHere on this grass-plot, in this very place,\nTo come and sport; her peacocks fly amain:\nApproach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.\n\nEnter Ceres.\n\nCERES.\nHail, many-colour’d messenger, that ne’er\nDost disobey the wife of Jupiter;\nWho with thy saffron wings upon my flowers\nDiffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;\nAnd with each end of thy blue bow dost crown\nMy bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down,\nRich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen\nSummon’d me hither to this short-grass’d green?\n\nIRIS.\nA contract of true love to celebrate,\nAnd some donation freely to estate\nOn the blest lovers.\n\nCERES.\nTell me, heavenly bow,\nIf Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\nDo now attend the queen? Since they did plot\nThe means that dusky Dis my daughter got,\nHer and her blind boy’s scandal’d company\nI have forsworn.\n\nIRIS.\nOf her society\nBe not afraid. I met her deity\nCutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\nDove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done\nSome wanton charm upon this man and maid,\nWhose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid\nTill Hymen’s torch be lighted; but in vain.\nMars’s hot minion is return’d again;\nHer waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\nSwears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,\nAnd be a boy right out.\n\nCERES.\nHighest queen of State,\nGreat Juno comes; I know her by her gait.\n\nEnter Juno.\n\nJUNO.\nHow does my bounteous sister? Go with me\nTo bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,\nAnd honour’d in their issue.\n\n[They sing.]\n\nJUNO.\nHonour, riches, marriage-blessing,\nLong continuance, and increasing,\nHourly joys be still upon you!\nJuno sings her blessings on you.\n\nCERES.\nEarth’s increase, foison plenty,\nBarns and garners never empty;\nVines with clust’ring bunches growing;\nPlants with goodly burden bowing;\nSpring come to you at the farthest\nIn the very end of harvest!\nScarcity and want shall shun you;\nCeres’ blessing so is on you.\n\nFERDINAND.\nThis is a most majestic vision, and\nHarmonious charmingly. May I be bold\nTo think these spirits?\n\nPROSPERO.\nSpirits, which by mine art\nI have from their confines call’d to enact\nMy present fancies.\n\nFERDINAND.\nLet me live here ever.\nSo rare a wonder’d father and a wise,\nMakes this place Paradise.\n\n[Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nSweet now, silence!\nJuno and Ceres whisper seriously,\nThere’s something else to do: hush, and be mute,\nOr else our spell is marr’d.\n\nIRIS.\nYou nymphs, call’d Naiads, of the windring brooks,\nWith your sedg’d crowns and ever-harmless looks,\nLeave your crisp channels, and on this green land\nAnswer your summons; Juno does command.\nCome, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate\nA contract of true love. Be not too late.\n\nEnter certain Nymphs.\n\nYou sun-burn’d sicklemen, of August weary,\nCome hither from the furrow, and be merry:\nMake holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,\nAnd these fresh nymphs encounter every one\nIn country footing.\n\nEnter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof Prospero starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside.] I had forgot that foul conspiracy\nOf the beast Caliban and his confederates\nAgainst my life: the minute of their plot\nIs almost come. [To the Spirits.] Well done! avoid; no\nmore!\n\nFERDINAND.\nThis is strange: your father’s in some passion\nThat works him strongly.\n\nMIRANDA.\nNever till this day\nSaw I him touch’d with anger so distemper’d.\n\nPROSPERO.\nYou do look, my son, in a mov’d sort,\nAs if you were dismay’d: be cheerful, sir:\nOur revels now are ended. These our actors,\nAs I foretold you, were all spirits and\nAre melted into air, into thin air:\nAnd, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\nThe cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\nAnd, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\nLeave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\nIs rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d:\nBear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled.\nBe not disturb’d with my infirmity.\nIf you be pleas’d, retire into my cell\nAnd there repose: a turn or two I’ll walk,\nTo still my beating mind.\n\nFERDINAND, MIRANDA.\nWe wish your peace.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nCome, with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel. Come!\n\nEnter Ariel.\n\nARIEL.\nThy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?\n\nPROSPERO.\nSpirit,\nWe must prepare to meet with Caliban.\n\nARIEL.\nAy, my commander. When I presented Ceres,\nI thought to have told thee of it; but I fear’d\nLest I might anger thee.\n\nPROSPERO.\nSay again, where didst thou leave these varlets?\n\nARIEL.\nI told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;\nSo full of valour that they smote the air\nFor breathing in their faces; beat the ground\nFor kissing of their feet; yet always bending\nTowards their project. Then I beat my tabor;\nAt which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears,\nAdvanc’d their eyelids, lifted up their noses\nAs they smelt music: so I charm’d their ears,\nThat calf-like they my lowing follow’d through\nTooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,\nWhich enter’d their frail shins: at last I left them\nI’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\nThere dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake\nO’erstunk their feet.\n\nPROSPERO.\nThis was well done, my bird.\nThy shape invisible retain thou still:\nThe trumpery in my house, go bring it hither\nFor stale to catch these thieves.\n\nARIEL.\nI go, I go.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nA devil, a born devil, on whose nature\nNurture can never stick; on whom my pains,\nHumanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;\nAnd as with age his body uglier grows,\nSo his mind cankers. I will plague them all,\nEven to roaring.\n\nRe-enter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, &c.\n\nCome, hang them on this line.\n\nProspero and Ariel remain invisible. Enter Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo all wet.\n\nCALIBAN.\nPray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not\nHear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMonster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us.\n\nTRINCULO.\nMonster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my nose is in great indignation.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nSo is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure against you, look you,—\n\nTRINCULO.\nThou wert but a lost monster.\n\nCALIBAN.\nGood my lord, give me thy favour still.\nBe patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to\nShall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.\nAll’s hush’d as midnight yet.\n\nTRINCULO.\nAy, but to lose our bottles in the pool!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nThere is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThat’s more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for my labour.\n\nCALIBAN.\nPrithee, my King, be quiet. Seest thou here,\nThis is the mouth o’ th’ cell: no noise, and enter.\nDo that good mischief which may make this island\nThine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,\nFor aye thy foot-licker.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nGive me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.\n\nTRINCULO.\nO King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!\nLook what a wardrobe here is for thee!\n\nCALIBAN.\nLet it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.\n\nTRINCULO.\nO, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nPut off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I’ll have that gown.\n\nTRINCULO.\nThy Grace shall have it.\n\nCALIBAN.\nThe dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean\nTo dote thus on such luggage? Let’t alone,\nAnd do the murder first. If he awake,\nFrom toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,\nMake us strange stuff.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nBe you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.\n\nTRINCULO.\nDo, do: we steal by line and level, an’t like your Grace.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI thank thee for that jest. Here’s a garment for ’t: wit shall not go unrewarded while I am King of this country. “Steal by line and level,” is an excellent pass of pate. There’s another garment for ’t.\n\nTRINCULO.\nMonster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI will have none on’t. We shall lose our time,\nAnd all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes\nWith foreheads villainous low.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nMonster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.\n\nTRINCULO.\nAnd this.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nAy, and this.\n\nA noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about; Prospero and Ariel setting them on.\n\nPROSPERO.\nHey, Mountain, hey!\n\nARIEL.\nSilver! there it goes, Silver!\n\nPROSPERO.\nFury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! hark, hark!\n\n[Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo are driven out.]\n\nGo, charge my goblins that they grind their joints\nWith dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews\nWith aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them\nThan pard, or cat o’ mountain.\n\nARIEL.\nHark, they roar.\n\nPROSPERO.\nLet them be hunted soundly. At this hour\nLies at my mercy all mine enemies.\nShortly shall all my labours end, and thou\nShalt have the air at freedom. For a little\nFollow, and do me service.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT V\nSCENE I. Before the cell of Prospero.\nEnter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.\n\nPROSPERO.\nNow does my project gather to a head:\nMy charms crack not; my spirits obey, and time\nGoes upright with his carriage. How’s the day?\n\nARIEL.\nOn the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\nYou said our work should cease.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI did say so,\nWhen first I rais’d the tempest. Say, my spirit,\nHow fares the King and ’s followers?\n\nARIEL.\nConfin’d together\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\nIn the line grove which weather-fends your cell;\nThey cannot budge till your release. The King,\nHis brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\nHim you term’d, sir, “the good old lord, Gonzalo”.\nHis tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops\nFrom eaves of reeds; your charm so strongly works ’em,\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\nWould become tender.\n\nPROSPERO.\nDost thou think so, spirit?\n\nARIEL.\nMine would, sir, were I human.\n\nPROSPERO.\nAnd mine shall.\nHast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\nOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,\nOne of their kind, that relish all as sharply\nPassion as they, be kindlier mov’d than thou art?\nThough with their high wrongs I am struck to th’ quick,\nYet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury\nDo I take part: the rarer action is\nIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\nNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel.\nMy charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,\nAnd they shall be themselves.\n\nARIEL.\nI’ll fetch them, sir.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nYe elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and\ngroves;\nAnd ye that on the sands with printless foot\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\nWhereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\nIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,\nWeak masters though ye be, I have bedimm’d\nThe noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds,\nAnd ’twixt the green sea and the azur’d vault\nSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\nHave I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak\nWith his own bolt; the strong-bas’d promontory\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up\nThe pine and cedar: graves at my command\nHave wak’d their sleepers, op’d, and let ’em forth\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic\nI here abjure; and, when I have requir’d\nSome heavenly music,—which even now I do,—\nTo work mine end upon their senses that\nThis airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\nI’ll drown my book.\n\n[Solemn music.]\n\nRe-enter Ariel: after him, Alonso with a frantic gesture, attended by Gonzalo, Sebastian and Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and Francisco: they all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there stand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.\n\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\nNow useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand,\nFor you are spell-stopp’d.\nHoly Gonzalo, honourable man,\nMine eyes, e’en sociable to the show of thine,\nFall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night,\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\nTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo!\nMy true preserver, and a loyal sir\nTo him thou follow’st, I will pay thy graces\nHome, both in word and deed. Most cruelly\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.\nThou art pinch’d for ’t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\nYou, brother mine, that entertain’d ambition,\nExpell’d remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,—\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,\nWould here have kill’d your King; I do forgive thee,\nUnnatural though thou art. Their understanding\nBegins to swell, and the approaching tide\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shores\nThat now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them\nThat yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,\nFetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.\n\n[Exit Ariel.]\n\nI will discase me, and myself present\nAs I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit;\nThou shalt ere long be free.\n\nAriel re-enters, singing, and helps to attire Prospero.\n\nARIEL\nWhere the bee sucks, there suck I:\nIn a cowslip’s bell I lie;\nThere I couch when owls do cry.\nOn the bat’s back I do fly\nAfter summer merrily.\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.\n\nPROSPERO.\nWhy, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;\nBut yet thou shalt have freedom; so, so, so.\nTo the King’s ship, invisible as thou art:\nThere shalt thou find the mariners asleep\nUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswain\nBeing awake, enforce them to this place,\nAnd presently, I prithee.\n\nARIEL.\nI drink the air before me, and return\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nGONZALO.\nAll torment, trouble, wonder and amazement\nInhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us\nOut of this fearful country!\n\nPROSPERO.\nBehold, sir King,\nThe wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.\nFor more assurance that a living prince\nDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;\nAnd to thee and thy company I bid\nA hearty welcome.\n\nALONSO.\nWhe’er thou be’st he or no,\nOr some enchanted trifle to abuse me,\nAs late I have been, I not know: thy pulse\nBeats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,\nTh’ affliction of my mind amends, with which,\nI fear, a madness held me: this must crave,\nAn if this be at all, a most strange story.\nThy dukedom I resign, and do entreat\nThou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero\nBe living and be here?\n\nPROSPERO.\nFirst, noble friend,\nLet me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot\nBe measur’d or confin’d.\n\nGONZALO.\nWhether this be\nOr be not, I’ll not swear.\n\nPROSPERO.\nYou do yet taste\nSome subtleties o’ the isle, that will not let you\nBelieve things certain. Welcome, my friends all.\n[Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.] But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,\nI here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you,\nAnd justify you traitors: at this time\nI will tell no tales.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\n[Aside.] The devil speaks in him.\n\nPROSPERO.\nNo.\nFor you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother\nWould even infect my mouth, I do forgive\nThy rankest fault, all of them; and require\nMy dukedom of thee, which perforce I know\nThou must restore.\n\nALONSO.\nIf thou beest Prospero,\nGive us particulars of thy preservation;\nHow thou hast met us here, whom three hours since\nWere wrack’d upon this shore; where I have lost,—\nHow sharp the point of this remembrance is!—\nMy dear son Ferdinand.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI am woe for ’t, sir.\n\nALONSO.\nIrreparable is the loss, and patience\nSays it is past her cure.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI rather think\nYou have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,\nFor the like loss I have her sovereign aid,\nAnd rest myself content.\n\nALONSO.\nYou the like loss!\n\nPROSPERO.\nAs great to me, as late; and, supportable\nTo make the dear loss, have I means much weaker\nThan you may call to comfort you, for I\nHave lost my daughter.\n\nALONSO.\nA daughter?\nO heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\nThe King and Queen there! That they were, I wish\nMyself were mudded in that oozy bed\nWhere my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?\n\nPROSPERO.\nIn this last tempest. I perceive, these lords\nAt this encounter do so much admire\nThat they devour their reason, and scarce think\nTheir eyes do offices of truth, their words\nAre natural breath; but, howsoe’er you have\nBeen justled from your senses, know for certain\nThat I am Prospero, and that very duke\nWhich was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely\nUpon this shore, where you were wrack’d, was landed\nTo be the lord on’t. No more yet of this;\nFor ’tis a chronicle of day by day,\nNot a relation for a breakfast nor\nBefitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir.\nThis cell’s my court: here have I few attendants,\nAnd subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.\nMy dukedom since you have given me again,\nI will requite you with as good a thing;\nAt least bring forth a wonder, to content ye\nAs much as me my dukedom.\n\nHere Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess.\n\nMIRANDA.\nSweet lord, you play me false.\n\nFERDINAND.\nNo, my dearest love,\nI would not for the world.\n\nMIRANDA.\nYes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\nAnd I would call it fair play.\n\nALONSO.\nIf this prove\nA vision of the island, one dear son\nShall I twice lose.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nA most high miracle!\n\nFERDINAND.\nThough the seas threaten, they are merciful.\nI have curs’d them without cause.\n\n[Kneels to Alonso.]\n\nALONSO.\nNow all the blessings\nOf a glad father compass thee about!\nArise, and say how thou cam’st here.\n\nMIRANDA.\nO, wonder!\nHow many goodly creatures are there here!\nHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world\nThat has such people in ’t!\n\nPROSPERO.\n’Tis new to thee.\n\nALONSO.\nWhat is this maid, with whom thou wast at play?\nYour eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours:\nIs she the goddess that hath sever’d us,\nAnd brought us thus together?\n\nFERDINAND.\nSir, she is mortal;\nBut by immortal Providence she’s mine.\nI chose her when I could not ask my father\nFor his advice, nor thought I had one. She\nIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\nOf whom so often I have heard renown,\nBut never saw before; of whom I have\nReceiv’d a second life; and second father\nThis lady makes him to me.\n\nALONSO.\nI am hers:\nBut, O, how oddly will it sound that I\nMust ask my child forgiveness!\n\nPROSPERO.\nThere, sir, stop:\nLet us not burden our remembrances with\nA heaviness that’s gone.\n\nGONZALO.\nI have inly wept,\nOr should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,\nAnd on this couple drop a blessed crown;\nFor it is you that have chalk’d forth the way\nWhich brought us hither.\n\nALONSO.\nI say, Amen, Gonzalo!\n\nGONZALO.\nWas Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue\nShould become Kings of Naples? O, rejoice\nBeyond a common joy, and set it down\nWith gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage\nDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\nAnd Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife\nWhere he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom\nIn a poor isle; and all of us ourselves,\nWhen no man was his own.\n\nALONSO.\n[To Ferdinand and Miranda.] Give me your hands:\nLet grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\nThat doth not wish you joy!\n\nGONZALO.\nBe it so. Amen!\n\nRe-enter Ariel with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.\n\nO look, sir, look, sir! Here are more of us.\nI prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\nThis fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\nThat swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?\nHast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nThe best news is that we have safely found\nOur King and company. The next, our ship,—\nWhich but three glasses since, we gave out split,\nIs tight and yare, and bravely rigg’d as when\nWe first put out to sea.\n\nARIEL.\n[Aside to Prospero.] Sir, all this service\nHave I done since I went.\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside to Ariel.] My tricksy spirit!\n\nALONSO.\nThese are not natural events; they strengthen\nFrom strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?\n\nBOATSWAIN.\nIf I did think, sir, I were well awake,\nI’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,\nAnd,—how, we know not,—all clapp’d under hatches,\nWhere, but even now, with strange and several noises\nOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\nAnd mo diversity of sounds, all horrible,\nWe were awak’d; straightway, at liberty:\nWhere we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\nOur royal, good, and gallant ship; our master\nCap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,\nEven in a dream, were we divided from them,\nAnd were brought moping hither.\n\nARIEL.\n[Aside to Prospero.] Was’t well done?\n\nPROSPERO.\n[Aside to Ariel.] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.\n\nALONSO.\nThis is as strange a maze as e’er men trod;\nAnd there is in this business more than nature\nWas ever conduct of: some oracle\nMust rectify our knowledge.\n\nPROSPERO.\nSir, my liege,\nDo not infest your mind with beating on\nThe strangeness of this business. At pick’d leisure,\nWhich shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,\nWhich to you shall seem probable, of every\nThese happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful\nAnd think of each thing well. [Aside to Ariel.] Come hither, spirit;\nSet Caliban and his companions free;\nUntie the spell.\n\n[Exit Ariel.]\n\nHow fares my gracious sir?\nThere are yet missing of your company\nSome few odd lads that you remember not.\n\nRe-enter Ariel driving in Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo in their stolen apparel.\n\nSTEPHANO.\nEvery man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself, for all is but fortune.—Coragio! bully-monster, coragio!\n\nTRINCULO.\nIf these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.\n\nCALIBAN.\nO Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed.\nHow fine my master is! I am afraid\nHe will chastise me.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHa, ha!\nWhat things are these, my lord Antonio?\nWill money buy them?\n\nANTONIO.\nVery like; one of them\nIs a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.\n\nPROSPERO.\nMark but the badges of these men, my lords,\nThen say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,\nHis mother was a witch; and one so strong\nThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,\nAnd deal in her command without her power.\nThese three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil,\nFor he’s a bastard one, had plotted with them\nTo take my life. Two of these fellows you\nMust know and own; this thing of darkness I\nAcknowledge mine.\n\nCALIBAN.\nI shall be pinch’d to death.\n\nALONSO.\nIs not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nHe is drunk now: where had he wine?\n\nALONSO.\nAnd Trinculo is reeling-ripe: where should they\nFind this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?\nHow cam’st thou in this pickle?\n\nTRINCULO.\nI have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones. I shall not fear fly-blowing.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nWhy, how now, Stephano!\n\nSTEPHANO.\nO! touch me not. I am not Stephano, but a cramp.\n\nPROSPERO.\nYou’d be King o’ the isle, sirrah?\n\nSTEPHANO.\nI should have been a sore one, then.\n\nALONSO.\nThis is as strange a thing as e’er I look’d on.\n\n[Pointing to Caliban.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nHe is as disproportioned in his manners\nAs in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;\nTake with you your companions. As you look\nTo have my pardon, trim it handsomely.\n\nCALIBAN.\nAy, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter,\nAnd seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass\nWas I, to take this drunkard for a god,\nAnd worship this dull fool!\n\nPROSPERO.\nGo to; away!\n\nALONSO.\nHence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.\n\nSEBASTIAN.\nOr stole it, rather.\n\n[Exeunt Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo.]\n\nPROSPERO.\nSir, I invite your Highness and your train\nTo my poor cell, where you shall take your rest\nFor this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste\nWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it\nGo quick away: the story of my life\nAnd the particular accidents gone by\nSince I came to this isle: and in the morn\nI’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,\nWhere I have hope to see the nuptial\nOf these our dear-belov’d solemnized;\nAnd thence retire me to my Milan, where\nEvery third thought shall be my grave.\n\nALONSO.\nI long\nTo hear the story of your life, which must\nTake the ear strangely.\n\nPROSPERO.\nI’ll deliver all;\nAnd promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,\nAnd sail so expeditious that shall catch\nYour royal fleet far off. [Aside to Ariel.] My Ariel,\nchick,\nThat is thy charge: then to the elements\nBe free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Let me not,\nSince I have my dukedom got,\nAnd pardon’d the deceiver, dwell\nIn this bare island by your spell,\nBut release me from my bands\nWith the help of your good hands.\nGentle breath of yours my sails\nMust fill, or else my project fails,\nWhich was to please. Now I want\nSpirits to enforce, art to enchant;\nAnd my ending is despair,\nUnless I be reliev’d by prayer,\nWhich pierces so that it assaults\nMercy itself, and frees all faults.\n    As you from crimes would pardon’d be,\n    Let your indulgence set me free.\n\n[Exit.]",
