Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and CARDINAL, on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other\nSUFFOLK\nAs by your high imperial majesty\nI had in charge at my depart for France,\nAs procurator to your excellence,\nTo marry Princess Margaret for your grace,\nSo, in the famous ancient city, Tours,\nIn presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,\nThe Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,\nSeven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,\nI have perform'd my task and was espoused:\nAnd humbly now upon my bended knee,\nIn sight of England and her lordly peers,\nDeliver up my title in the queen\nTo your most gracious hands, that are the substance\nOf that great shadow I did represent;\nThe happiest gift that ever marquess gave,\nThe fairest queen that ever king received.\nKING HENRY VI\nSuffolk, arise.

Lord marquess, kneel down:\nWe here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,\nAnd gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,\nWe here discharge your grace from being regent\nI' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months\nBe full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,\nGloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,\nSalisbury, and Warwick;\nWe thank you all for the great favour done,\nIn entertainment to my princely queen.\nCome, let us in, and with all speed provide\nTo see her coronation be perform'd.\nExeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLK\n\nGLOUCESTER\nBrave peers of England, pillars of the state,\nTo you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,\nYour grief, the common grief of all the land.\nWhat! did my brother Henry spend his youth,\nHis valour, coin and people, in the wars?\nDid he so often lodge in open field,\nIn winter's cold and summer's parching heat,\nTo conquer France, his true inheritance?\nAnd did my brother Bedford toil his wits,\nTo keep by policy what Henry got?\nHave you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,\nBrave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,\nReceived deep scars in France and Normandy?\nOr hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,\nWith all the learned council of the realm,\nStudied so long, sat in the council-house\nEarly and late, debating to and fro\nHow France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,\nAnd had his highness in his infancy\nCrowned in Paris in despite of foes?\nAnd shall these labours and these honours die?\nShall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,\nYour deeds of war and all our counsel die?\nO peers of England, shameful is this league!\nFatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,\nBlotting your names from books of memory,\nRazing the characters of your renown,\nDefacing monuments of conquer'd France,\nUndoing all, as all had never been!\nCARDINAL\nNephew, what means this passionate discourse,\nThis peroration with such circumstance?\nFor France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.\nGLOUCESTER\nAy, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;\nBut now it is impossible we should:\nSuffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,\nHath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine\nUnto the poor King Reignier, whose large style\nAgrees not with the leanness of his purse.\nSALISBURY\nNow, by the death of Him that died for all,\nThese counties were the keys of Normandy.\nBut wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?\nWARWICK\nFor grief that they are past recovery:\nFor, were there hope to conquer them again,\nMy sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.\nAnjou and Maine! myself did win them both;\nThose provinces these arms of mine did conquer:\nAnd are the cities, that I got with wounds,\nDelivered up again with peaceful words?\nMort Dieu!\nYORK\nFor Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,\nThat dims the honour of this warlike isle!\nFrance should have torn and rent my very heart,\nBefore I would have yielded to this league.\nI never read but England's kings have had\nLarge sums of gold and dowries with their wives:\nAnd our King Henry gives away his own,\nTo match with her that brings no vantages.\nGLOUCESTER\nA proper jest, and never heard before,\nThat Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth\nFor costs and charges in transporting her!\nShe should have stayed in France and starved\nin France, Before--\nCARDINAL\nMy Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:\nIt was the pleasure of my lord the King.\nGLOUCESTER\nMy Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;\n'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,\nBut 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.\nRancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face\nI see thy fury: if I longer stay,\nWe shall begin our ancient bickerings.\nLordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,\nI prophesied France will be lost ere long.\nExit\n\nCARDINAL\nSo, there goes our protector in a rage.\n'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,\nNay, more, an enemy unto you all,\nAnd no great friend, I fear me, to the king.\nConsider, lords, he is the next of blood,\nAnd heir apparent to the English crown:\nHad Henry got an empire by his marriage,\nAnd all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,\nThere's reason he should be displeased at it.\nLook to it, lords! let not his smoothing words\nBewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.\nWhat though the common people favour him,\nCalling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of\nGloucester,'\nClapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,\n'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'\nWith 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'\nI fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,\nHe will be found a dangerous protector.\nBUCKINGHAM\nWhy should he, then, protect our sovereign,\nHe being of age to govern of himself?\nCousin of Somerset, join you with me,\nAnd all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,\nWe'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.\nCARDINAL\nThis weighty business will not brook delay:\nI'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.\nExit\n\nSOMERSET\nCousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride\nAnd greatness of his place be grief to us,\nYet let us watch the haughty cardinal:\nHis insolence is more intolerable\nThan all the princes in the land beside:\nIf Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.\nBUCKINGHAM\nOr thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,\nDespite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.\nExeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET\n\nSALISBURY\nPride went before, ambition follows him.\nWhile these do labour for their own preferment,\nBehoves it us to labour for the realm.\nI never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester\nDid bear him like a noble gentleman.\nOft have I seen the haughty cardinal,\nMore like a soldier than a man o' the church,\nAs stout and proud as he were lord of all,\nSwear like a ruffian and demean himself\nUnlike the ruler of a commonweal.\nWarwick, my son, the comfort of my age,\nThy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,\nHath won the greatest favour of the commons,\nExcepting none but good Duke Humphrey:\nAnd, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,\nIn bringing them to civil discipline,\nThy late exploits done in the heart of France,\nWhen thou wert regent for our sovereign,\nHave made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:\nJoin we together, for the public good,\nIn what we can, to bridle and suppress\nThe pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,\nWith Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;\nAnd, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,\nWhile they do tend the profit of the land.\nWARWICK\nSo God help Warwick, as he loves the land,\nAnd common profit of his country!\nYORK\n[Aside] And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.\nSALISBURY\nThen let's make haste away, and look unto the main.\nWARWICK\nUnto the main! O father, Maine is lost;\nThat Maine which by main force Warwick did win,\nAnd would have kept so long as breath did last!\nMain chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,\nWhich I will win from France, or else be slain,\nExeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY\n\nYORK\nAnjou and Maine are given to the French;\nParis is lost; the state of Normandy\nStands on a tickle point, now they are gone:\nSuffolk concluded on the articles,\nThe peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased\nTo change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.\nI cannot blame them all: what is't to them?\n'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.\nPirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage\nAnd purchase friends and give to courtezans,\nStill revelling like lords till all be gone;\nWhile as the silly owner of the goods\nWeeps over them and wrings his hapless hands\nAnd shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,\nWhile all is shared and all is borne away,\nReady to starve and dare not touch his own:\nSo York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,\nWhile his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.\nMethinks the realms of England, France and Ireland\nBear that proportion to my flesh and blood\nAs did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd\nUnto the prince's heart of Calydon.\nAnjou and Maine both given unto the French!\nCold news for me, for I had hope of France,\nEven as I have of fertile England's soil.\nA day will come when York shall claim his own;\nAnd therefore I will take the Nevils' parts\nAnd make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,\nAnd, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,\nFor that's the golden mark I seek to hit:\nNor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,\nNor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,\nNor wear the diadem upon his head,\nWhose church-like humours fits not for a crown.\nThen, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:\nWatch thou and wake when others be asleep,\nTo pry into the secrets of the state;\nTill Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,\nWith his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,\nAnd Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:\nThen will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,\nWith whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;\nAnd in my standard bear the arms of York\nTo grapple with the house of Lancaster;\nAnd, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,\nWhose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.\nExit",

Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament\nKING HENRY VI\nI muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:\n'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,\nWhate'er occasion keeps him from us now.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nCan you not see? or will ye not observe\nThe strangeness of his alter'd countenance?\nWith what a majesty he bears himself,\nHow insolent of late he is become,\nHow proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?\nWe know the time since he was mild and affable,\nAnd if we did but glance a far-off look,\nImmediately he was upon his knee,\nThat all the court admired him for submission:\nBut meet him now, and, be it in the morn,\nWhen every one will give the time of day,\nHe knits his brow and shows an angry eye,\nAnd passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,\nDisdaining duty that to us belongs.\nSmall curs are not regarded when they grin;\nBut great men tremble when the lion roars;\nAnd Humphrey is no little man in England.\nFirst note that he is near you in descent,\nAnd should you fall, he as the next will mount.\nMe seemeth then it is no policy,\nRespecting what a rancorous mind he bears\nAnd his advantage following your decease,\nThat he should come about your royal person\nOr be admitted to your highness' council.\nBy flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,\nAnd when he please to make commotion,\n'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.\nNow 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;\nSuffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden\nAnd choke the herbs for want of husbandry.\nThe reverent care I bear unto my lord\nMade me collect these dangers in the duke.\nIf it be fond, call it a woman's fear;\nWhich fear if better reasons can supplant,\nI will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.\nMy Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,\nReprove my allegation, if you can;\nOr else conclude my words effectual.\nSUFFOLK\nWell hath your highness seen into this duke;\nAnd, had I first been put to speak my mind,\nI think I should have told your grace's tale.\nThe duchess, by his subornation,\nUpon my life, began her devilish practises:\nOr, if he were not privy to those faults,\nYet, by reputing of his high descent,\nAs next the king he was successive heir,\nAnd such high vaunts of his nobility,\nDid instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess\nBy wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.\nSmooth runs the water where the brook is deep;\nAnd in his simple show he harbours treason.\nThe fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.\nNo, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man\nUnsounded yet and full of deep deceit.\nCARDINAL\nDid he not, contrary to form of law,\nDevise strange deaths for small offences done?\nYORK\nAnd did he not, in his protectorship,\nLevy great sums of money through the realm\nFor soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?\nBy means whereof the towns each day revolted.\nBUCKINGHAM\nTut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.\nWhich time will bring to light in smooth\nDuke Humphrey.\nKING HENRY VI\nMy lords, at once: the care you have of us,\nTo mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,\nIs worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,\nOur kinsman Gloucester is as innocent\nFrom meaning treason to our royal person\nAs is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:\nThe duke is virtuous, mild and too well given\nTo dream on evil or to work my downfall.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAh, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!\nSeems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,\nFor he's disposed as the hateful raven:\nIs he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,\nFor he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.\nWho cannot steal a shape that means deceit?\nTake heed, my lord; the welfare of us all\nHangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.\nEnter SOMERSET\n\nSOMERSET\nAll health unto my gracious sovereign!\nKING HENRY VI\nWelcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?\nSOMERSET\nThat all your interest in those territories\nIs utterly bereft you; all is lost.\nKING HENRY VI\nCold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!\nYORK\n[Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France\nAs firmly as I hope for fertile England.\nThus are my blossoms blasted in the bud\nAnd caterpillars eat my leaves away;\nBut I will remedy this gear ere long,\nOr sell my title for a glorious grave.\nEnter GLOUCESTER\n\nGLOUCESTER\nAll happiness unto my lord the king!\nPardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.\nSUFFOLK\nNay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,\nUnless thou wert more loyal than thou art:\nI do arrest thee of high treason here.\nGLOUCESTER\nWell, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush\nNor change my countenance for this arrest:\nA heart unspotted is not easily daunted.\nThe purest spring is not so free from mud\nAs I am clear from treason to my sovereign:\nWho can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?\nYORK\n'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,\nAnd, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;\nBy means whereof his highness hath lost France.\nGLOUCESTER\nIs it but thought so? what are they that think it?\nI never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,\nNor ever had one penny bribe from France.\nSo help me God, as I have watch'd the night,\nAy, night by night, in studying good for England,\nThat doit that e'er I wrested from the king,\nOr any groat I hoarded to my use,\nBe brought against me at my trial-day!\nNo; many a pound of mine own proper store,\nBecause I would not tax the needy commons,\nHave I disbursed to the garrisons,\nAnd never ask'd for restitution.\nCARDINAL\nIt serves you well, my lord, to say so much.\nGLOUCESTER\nI say no more than truth, so help me God!\nYORK\nIn your protectorship you did devise\nStrange tortures for offenders never heard of,\nThat England was defamed by tyranny.\nGLOUCESTER\nWhy, 'tis well known that, whiles I was\nprotector,\nPity was all the fault that was in me;\nFor I should melt at an offender's tears,\nAnd lowly words were ransom for their fault.\nUnless it were a bloody murderer,\nOr foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,\nI never gave them condign punishment:\nMurder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured\nAbove the felon or what trespass else.\nSUFFOLK\nMy lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:\nBut mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,\nWhereof you cannot easily purge yourself.\nI do arrest you in his highness' name;\nAnd here commit you to my lord cardinal\nTo keep, until your further time of trial.\nKING HENRY VI\nMy lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope\nThat you will clear yourself from all suspect:\nMy conscience tells me you are innocent.\nGLOUCESTER\nAh, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:\nVirtue is choked with foul ambition\nAnd charity chased hence by rancour's hand;\nFoul subornation is predominant\nAnd equity exiled your highness' land.\nI know their complot is to have my life,\nAnd if my death might make this island happy,\nAnd prove the period of their tyranny,\nI would expend it with all willingness:\nBut mine is made the prologue to their play;\nFor thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,\nWill not conclude their plotted tragedy.\nBeaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,\nAnd Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;\nSharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue\nThe envious load that lies upon his heart;\nAnd dogged York, that reaches at the moon,\nWhose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,\nBy false accuse doth level at my life:\nAnd you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,\nCauseless have laid disgraces on my head,\nAnd with your best endeavour have stirr'd up\nMy liefest liege to be mine enemy:\nAy, all you have laid your heads together--\nMyself had notice of your conventicles--\nAnd all to make away my guiltless life.\nI shall not want false witness to condemn me,\nNor store of treasons to augment my guilt;\nThe ancient proverb will be well effected:\n'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'\nCARDINAL\nMy liege, his railing is intolerable:\nIf those that care to keep your royal person\nFrom treason's secret knife and traitors' rage\nBe thus upbraided, chid and rated at,\nAnd the offender granted scope of speech,\n'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.\nSUFFOLK\nHath he not twit our sovereign lady here\nWith ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,\nAs if she had suborned some to swear\nFalse allegations to o'erthrow his state?\nQUEEN MARGARET\nBut I can give the loser leave to chide.\nGLOUCESTER\nFar truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;\nBeshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!\nAnd well such losers may have leave to speak.\nBUCKINGHAM\nHe'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:\nLord cardinal, he is your prisoner.\nCARDINAL\nSirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.\nGLOUCESTER\nAh! thus King Henry throws away his crutch\nBefore his legs be firm to bear his body.\nThus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,\nAnd wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.\nAh, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!\nFor, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.\nExit, guarded\n\nKING HENRY VI\nMy lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,\nDo or undo, as if ourself were here.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nWhat, will your highness leave the parliament?\nKING HENRY VI\nAy, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,\nWhose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,\nMy body round engirt with misery,\nFor what's more miserable than discontent?\nAh, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see\nThe map of honour, truth and loyalty:\nAnd yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come\nThat e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.\nWhat louring star now envies thy estate,\nThat these great lords and Margaret our queen\nDo seek subversion of thy harmless life?\nThou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;\nAnd as the butcher takes away the calf\nAnd binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,\nBearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,\nEven so remorseless have they borne him hence;\nAnd as the dam runs lowing up and down,\nLooking the way her harmless young one went,\nAnd can do nought but wail her darling's loss,\nEven so myself bewails good Gloucester's case\nWith sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes\nLook after him and cannot do him good,\nSo mighty are his vowed enemies.\nHis fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan\nSay 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'\nExeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET remains apart\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nFree lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.\nHenry my lord is cold in great affairs,\nToo full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show\nBeguiles him as the mournful crocodile\nWith sorrow snares relenting passengers,\nOr as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,\nWith shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child\nThat for the beauty thinks it excellent.\nBelieve me, lords, were none more wise than I--\nAnd yet herein I judge mine own wit good--\nThis Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,\nTo rid us of the fear we have of him.\nCARDINAL\nThat he should die is worthy policy;\nBut yet we want a colour for his death:\n'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.\nSUFFOLK\nBut, in my mind, that were no policy:\nThe king will labour still to save his life,\nThe commons haply rise, to save his life;\nAnd yet we have but trivial argument,\nMore than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.\nYORK\nSo that, by this, you would not have him die.\nSUFFOLK\nAh, York, no man alive so fain as I!\nYORK\n'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.\nBut, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,\nSay as you think, and speak it from your souls,\nWere't not all one, an empty eagle were set\nTo guard the chicken from a hungry kite,\nAs place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?\nQUEEN MARGARET\nSo the poor chicken should be sure of death.\nSUFFOLK\nMadam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,\nTo make the fox surveyor of the fold?\nWho being accused a crafty murderer,\nHis guilt should be but idly posted over,\nBecause his purpose is not executed.\nNo; let him die, in that he is a fox,\nBy nature proved an enemy to the flock,\nBefore his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,\nAs Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.\nAnd do not stand on quillets how to slay him:\nBe it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,\nSleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,\nSo he be dead; for that is good deceit\nWhich mates him first that first intends deceit.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nThrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.\nSUFFOLK\nNot resolute, except so much were done;\nFor things are often spoke and seldom meant:\nBut that my heart accordeth with my tongue,\nSeeing the deed is meritorious,\nAnd to preserve my sovereign from his foe,\nSay but the word, and I will be his priest.\nCARDINAL\nBut I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,\nEre you can take due orders for a priest:\nSay you consent and censure well the deed,\nAnd I'll provide his executioner,\nI tender so the safety of my liege.\nSUFFOLK\nHere is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAnd so say I.\nYORK\nAnd I and now we three have spoke it,\nIt skills not greatly who impugns our doom.\nEnter a Post\n\nPost\nGreat lords, from Ireland am I come amain,\nTo signify that rebels there are up\nAnd put the Englishmen unto the sword:\nSend succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,\nBefore the wound do grow uncurable;\nFor, being green, there is great hope of help.\nCARDINAL\nA breach that craves a quick expedient stop!\nWhat counsel give you in this weighty cause?\nYORK\nThat Somerset be sent as regent thither:\n'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;\nWitness the fortune he hath had in France.\nSOMERSET\nIf York, with all his far-fet policy,\nHad been the regent there instead of me,\nHe never would have stay'd in France so long.\nYORK\nNo, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:\nI rather would have lost my life betimes\nThan bring a burthen of dishonour home\nBy staying there so long till all were lost.\nShow me one scar character'd on thy skin:\nMen's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nNay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,\nIf wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:\nNo more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:\nThy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,\nMight happily have proved far worse than his.\nYORK\nWhat, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!\nSOMERSET\nAnd, in the number, thee that wishest shame!\nCARDINAL\nMy Lord of York, try what your fortune is.\nThe uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms\nAnd temper clay with blood of Englishmen:\nTo Ireland will you lead a band of men,\nCollected choicely, from each county some,\nAnd try your hap against the Irishmen?\nYORK\nI will, my lord, so please his majesty.\nSUFFOLK\nWhy, our authority is his consent,\nAnd what we do establish he confirms:\nThen, noble York, take thou this task in hand.\nYORK\nI am content: provide me soldiers, lords,\nWhiles I take order for mine own affairs.\nSUFFOLK\nA charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.\nBut now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.\nCARDINAL\nNo more of him; for I will deal with him\nThat henceforth he shall trouble us no more.\nAnd so break off; the day is almost spent:\nLord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.\nYORK\nMy Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days\nAt Bristol I expect my soldiers;\nFor there I'll ship them all for Ireland.\nSUFFOLK\nI'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.\nExeunt all but YORK\n\nYORK\nNow, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,\nAnd change misdoubt to resolution:\nBe that thou hopest to be, or what thou art\nResign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:\nLet pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,\nAnd find no harbour in a royal heart.\nFaster than spring-time showers comes thought\non thought,\nAnd not a thought but thinks on dignity.\nMy brain more busy than the labouring spider\nWeaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.\nWell, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,\nTo send me packing with an host of men:\nI fear me you but warm the starved snake,\nWho, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting\nyour hearts.\n'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:\nI take it kindly; and yet be well assured\nYou put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.\nWhiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,\nI will stir up in England some black storm\nShall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;\nAnd this fell tempest shall not cease to rage\nUntil the golden circuit on my head,\nLike to the glorious sun's transparent beams,\nDo calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.\nAnd, for a minister of my intent,\nI have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,\nJohn Cade of Ashford,\nTo make commotion, as full well he can,\nUnder the title of John Mortimer.\nIn Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade\nOppose himself against a troop of kerns,\nAnd fought so long, till that his thighs with darts\nWere almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;\nAnd, in the end being rescued, I have seen\nHim caper upright like a wild Morisco,\nShaking the bloody darts as he his bells.\nFull often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,\nHath he conversed with the enemy,\nAnd undiscover'd come to me again\nAnd given me notice of their villanies.\nThis devil here shall be my substitute;\nFor that John Mortimer, which now is dead,\nIn face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:\nBy this I shall perceive the commons' mind,\nHow they affect the house and claim of York.\nSay he be taken, rack'd and tortured,\nI know no pain they can inflict upon him\nWill make him say I moved him to those arms.\nSay that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,\nWhy, then from Ireland come I with my strength\nAnd reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;\nFor Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,\nAnd Henry put apart, the next for me.\nExit",

Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons\n\nWARWICK\nIt is reported, mighty sovereign,\nThat good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd\nBy Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.\nThe commons, like an angry hive of bees\nThat want their leader, scatter up and down\nAnd care not who they sting in his revenge.\nMyself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,\nUntil they hear the order of his death.\nKING HENRY VI\nThat he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;\nBut how he died God knows, not Henry:\nEnter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,\nAnd comment then upon his sudden death.\nWARWICK\nThat shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,\nWith the rude multitude till I return.\nExit\n\nKING HENRY VI\nO Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,\nMy thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul\nSome violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!\nIf my suspect be false, forgive me, God,\nFor judgment only doth belong to thee.\nFain would I go to chafe his paly lips\nWith twenty thousand kisses, and to drain\nUpon his face an ocean of salt tears,\nTo tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,\nAnd with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:\nBut all in vain are these mean obsequies;\nAnd to survey his dead and earthly image,\nWhat were it but to make my sorrow greater?\nRe-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed\n\nWARWICK\nCome hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.\nKING HENRY VI\nThat is to see how deep my grave is made;\nFor with his soul fled all my worldly solace,\nFor seeing him I see my life in death.\nWARWICK\nAs surely as my soul intends to live\nWith that dread King that took our state upon him\nTo free us from his father's wrathful curse,\nI do believe that violent hands were laid\nUpon the life of this thrice-famed duke.\nSUFFOLK\nA dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!\nWhat instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?\nWARWICK\nSee how the blood is settled in his face.\nOft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,\nOf ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,\nBeing all descended to the labouring heart;\nWho, in the conflict that it holds with death,\nAttracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;\nWhich with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth\nTo blush and beautify the cheek again.\nBut see, his face is black and full of blood,\nHis eye-balls further out than when he lived,\nStaring full ghastly like a strangled man;\nHis hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;\nHis hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd\nAnd tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:\nLook, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;\nHis well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,\nLike to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.\nIt cannot be but he was murder'd here;\nThe least of all these signs were probable.\nSUFFOLK\nWhy, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?\nMyself and Beaufort had him in protection;\nAnd we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.\nWARWICK\nBut both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,\nAnd you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:\n'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;\nAnd 'tis well seen he found an enemy.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nThen you, belike, suspect these noblemen\nAs guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.\nWARWICK\nWho finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh\nAnd sees fast by a butcher with an axe,\nBut will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?\nWho finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,\nBut may imagine how the bird was dead,\nAlthough the kite soar with unbloodied beak?\nEven so suspicious is this tragedy.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAre you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?\nIs Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?\nSUFFOLK\nI wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;\nBut here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,\nThat shall be scoured in his rancorous heart\nThat slanders me with murder's crimson badge.\nSay, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,\nThat I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.\nExeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others\n\nWARWICK\nWhat dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?\nQUEEN MARGARET\nHe dares not calm his contumelious spirit\nNor cease to be an arrogant controller,\nThough Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.\nWARWICK\nMadam, be still; with reverence may I say;\nFor every word you speak in his behalf\nIs slander to your royal dignity.\nSUFFOLK\nBlunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!\nIf ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,\nThy mother took into her blameful bed\nSome stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock\nWas graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,\nAnd never of the Nevils' noble race.\nWARWICK\nBut that the guilt of murder bucklers thee\nAnd I should rob the deathsman of his fee,\nQuitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,\nAnd that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,\nI would, false murderous coward, on thy knee\nMake thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,\nAnd say it was thy mother that thou meant'st\nThat thou thyself was born in bastardy;\nAnd after all this fearful homage done,\nGive thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,\nPernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!\nSUFFOLK\nThou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,\nIf from this presence thou darest go with me.\nWARWICK\nAway even now, or I will drag thee hence:\nUnworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee\nAnd do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.\nExeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK\n\nKING HENRY VI\nWhat stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!\nThrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,\nAnd he but naked, though lock'd up in steel\nWhose conscience with injustice is corrupted.\nA noise within\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nWhat noise is this?\nRe-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawn\n\nKING HENRY VI\nWhy, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn\nHere in our presence! dare you be so bold?\nWhy, what tumultuous clamour have we here?\nSUFFOLK\nThe traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury\nSet all upon me, mighty sovereign.\nSALISBURY\n[To the Commons, entering] Sirs, stand apart;\nthe king shall know your mind.\nDread lord, the commons send you word by me,\nUnless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,\nOr banished fair England's territories,\nThey will by violence tear him from your palace\nAnd torture him with grievous lingering death.\nThey say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;\nThey say, in him they fear your highness' death;\nAnd mere instinct of love and loyalty,\nFree from a stubborn opposite intent,\nAs being thought to contradict your liking,\nMakes them thus forward in his banishment.\nThey say, in care of your most royal person,\nThat if your highness should intend to sleep\nAnd charge that no man should disturb your rest\nIn pain of your dislike or pain of death,\nYet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,\nWere there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,\nThat slily glided towards your majesty,\nIt were but necessary you were waked,\nLest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,\nThe mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;\nAnd therefore do they cry, though you forbid,\nThat they will guard you, whether you will or no,\nFrom such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,\nWith whose envenomed and fatal sting,\nYour loving uncle, twenty times his worth,\nThey say, is shamefully bereft of life.\nCommons\n[Within] An answer from the king, my\nLord of Salisbury!\nSUFFOLK\n'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,\nCould send such message to their sovereign:\nBut you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,\nTo show how quaint an orator you are:\nBut all the honour Salisbury hath won\nIs, that he was the lord ambassador\nSent from a sort of tinkers to the king.\nCommons\n[Within] An answer from the king, or we will all break in!\nKING HENRY VI\nGo, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.\nI thank them for their tender loving care;\nAnd had I not been cited so by them,\nYet did I purpose as they do entreat;\nFor, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy\nMischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:\nAnd therefore, by His majesty I swear,\nWhose far unworthy deputy I am,\nHe shall not breathe infection in this air\nBut three days longer, on the pain of death.\nExit SALISBURY\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nO Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!\nKING HENRY VI\nUngentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!\nNo more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,\nThou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.\nHad I but said, I would have kept my word,\nBut when I swear, it is irrevocable.\nIf, after three days' space, thou here be'st found\nOn any ground that I am ruler of,\nThe world shall not be ransom for thy life.\nCome, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;\nI have great matters to impart to thee.\nExeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nMischance and sorrow go along with you!\nHeart's discontent and sour affliction\nBe playfellows to keep you company!\nThere's two of you; the devil make a third!\nAnd threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!\nSUFFOLK\nCease, gentle queen, these execrations,\nAnd let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nFie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!\nHast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?\nSUFFOLK\nA plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?\nWould curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,\nI would invent as bitter-searching terms,\nAs curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,\nDeliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,\nWith full as many signs of deadly hate,\nAs lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:\nMy tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;\nMine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;\nMine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;\nAy, every joint should seem to curse and ban:\nAnd even now my burthen'd heart would break,\nShould I not curse them. Poison be their drink!\nGall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!\nTheir sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!\nTheir chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!\nTheir softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!\nTheir music frightful as the serpent's hiss,\nAnd boding screech-owls make the concert full!\nAll the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--\nQUEEN MARGARET\nEnough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;\nAnd these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,\nOr like an overcharged gun, recoil,\nAnd turn the force of them upon thyself.\nSUFFOLK\nYou bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?\nNow, by the ground that I am banish'd from,\nWell could I curse away a winter's night,\nThough standing naked on a mountain top,\nWhere biting cold would never let grass grow,\nAnd think it but a minute spent in sport.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nO, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,\nThat I may dew it with my mournful tears;\nNor let the rain of heaven wet this place,\nTo wash away my woful monuments.\nO, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,\nThat thou mightst think upon these by the seal,\nThrough whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!\nSo, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;\n'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,\nAs one that surfeits thinking on a want.\nI will repeal thee, or, be well assured,\nAdventure to be banished myself:\nAnd banished I am, if but from thee.\nGo; speak not to me; even now be gone.\nO, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd\nEmbrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,\nLoather a hundred times to part than die.\nYet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!\nSUFFOLK\nThus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;\nOnce by the king, and three times thrice by thee.\n'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;\nA wilderness is populous enough,\nSo Suffolk had thy heavenly company:\nFor where thou art, there is the world itself,\nWith every several pleasure in the world,\nAnd where thou art not, desolation.\nI can no more: live thou to joy thy life;\nMyself no joy in nought but that thou livest.\nEnter VAUX\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nWither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?\nVAUX\nTo signify unto his majesty\nThat Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;\nFor suddenly a grievous sickness took him,\nThat makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,\nBlaspheming God and cursing men on earth.\nSometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost\nWere by his side; sometime he calls the king,\nAnd whispers to his pillow, as to him,\nThe secrets of his overcharged soul;\nAnd I am sent to tell his majesty\nThat even now he cries aloud for him.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nGo tell this heavy message to the king.\nExit VAUX\n\nAy me! what is this world! what news are these!\nBut wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,\nOmitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?\nWhy only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,\nAnd with the southern clouds contend in tears,\nTheirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?\nNow get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;\nIf thou be found by me, thou art but dead.\nSUFFOLK\nIf I depart from thee, I cannot live;\nAnd in thy sight to die, what were it else\nBut like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?\nHere could I breathe my soul into the air,\nAs mild and gentle as the cradle-babe\nDying with mother's dug between its lips:\nWhere, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,\nAnd cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,\nTo have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;\nSo shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,\nOr I should breathe it so into thy body,\nAnd then it lived in sweet Elysium.\nTo die by thee were but to die in jest;\nFrom thee to die were torture more than death:\nO, let me stay, befall what may befall!\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAway! though parting be a fretful corrosive,\nIt is applied to a deathful wound.\nTo France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;\nFor wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,\nI'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.\nSUFFOLK\nI go.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAnd take my heart with thee.\nSUFFOLK\nA jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask\nThat ever did contain a thing of worth.\nEven as a splitted bark, so sunder we\nThis way fall I to death.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nThis way for me.\nExeunt severally",

Away! convey him hence.\nSUFFOLK\nO that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder\nUpon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!\nSmall things make base men proud: this villain here,\nBeing captain of a pinnace, threatens more\nThan Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.\nDrones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:\nIt is impossible that I should die\nBy such a lowly vassal as thyself.\nThy words move rage and not remorse in me:\nI go of message from the queen to France;\nI charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.\nCaptain\nWalter,--\nWHITMORE\nCome, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.\nSUFFOLK\nGelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.\nWHITMORE\nThou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.\nWhat, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?\nFirst Gentleman\nMy gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.\nSUFFOLK\nSuffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,\nUsed to command, untaught to plead for favour.\nFar be it we should honour such as these\nWith humble suit: no, rather let my head\nStoop to the block than these knees bow to any\nSave to the God of heaven and to my king;\nAnd sooner dance upon a bloody pole\nThan stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.\nTrue nobility is exempt from fear:\nMore can I bear than you dare execute.\nCaptain\nHale him away, and let him talk no more.\nSUFFOLK\nCome, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,\nThat this my death may never be forgot!\nGreat men oft die by vile bezonians:\nA Roman sworder and banditto slave\nMurder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand\nStabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders\nPompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.\nExeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk\n\nCaptain\nAnd as for these whose ransom we have set,\nIt is our pleasure one of them depart;\nTherefore come you with us and let him go.\nExeunt all but the First Gentleman\n\nRe-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body\n\nWHITMORE\nThere let his head and lifeless body lie,\nUntil the queen his mistress bury it.\nExit\n\nFirst Gentleman\nO barbarous and bloody spectacle!\nHis body will I bear unto the king:\nIf he revenge it not, yet will his friends;\nSo will the queen, that living held him dear.\nExit with the body",

Address thee instantly.\nThey fight, and CLIFFORD falls\n\nCLIFFORD\nLa fin couronne les oeuvres.\nDies\n\nYORK\nThus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.\nPeace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!\nExit\n\nEnter YOUNG CLIFFORD\n\nYOUNG CLIFFORD\nShame and confusion! all is on the rout;\nFear frames disorder, and disorder wounds\nWhere it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,\nWhom angry heavens do make their minister\nThrow in the frozen bosoms of our part\nHot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.\nHe that is truly dedicate to war\nHath no self-love, nor he that loves himself\nHath not essentially but by circumstance\nThe name of valour.\nSeeing his dead father\n\nO, let the vile world end,\nAnd the premised flames of the last day\nKnit earth and heaven together!\nNow let the general trumpet blow his blast,\nParticularities and petty sounds\nTo cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,\nTo lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve\nThe silver livery of advised age,\nAnd, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus\nTo die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight\nMy heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,\nIt shall be stony. York not our old men spares;\nNo more will I their babes: tears virginal\nShall be to me even as the dew to fire,\nAnd beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims\nShall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.\nHenceforth I will not have to do with pity:\nMeet I an infant of the house of York,\nInto as many gobbets will I cut it\nAs wild Medea young Absyrtus did:\nIn cruelty will I seek out my fame.\nCome, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:\nAs did AEneas old Anchises bear,\nSo bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;\nBut then AEneas bare a living load,\nNothing so heavy as these woes of mine.\nExit, bearing off his father\n\nEnter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed\n\nRICHARD\nSo, lie thou there;\nFor underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,\nThe Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset\nHath made the wizard famous in his death.\nSword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:\nPriests pray for enemies, but princes kill.\nExit\n\nFight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and others\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\nAway, my lord! you are slow; for shame, away!\nKING HENRY VI\nCan we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.\nQUEEN MARGARET\nWhat are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:\nNow is it manhood, wisdom and defence,\nTo give the enemy way, and to secure us\nBy what we can, which can no more but fly.\nAlarum afar off\n\nIf you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom\nOf all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,\nAs well we may, if not through your neglect,\nWe shall to London get, where you are loved\nAnd where this breach now in our fortunes made\nMay readily be stopp'd.\nRe-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD\n\nYOUNG CLIFFORD\nBut that my heart's on future mischief set,\nI would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:\nBut fly you must; uncurable discomfit\nReigns in the hearts of all our present parts.\nAway, for your relief! and we will live\nTo see their day and them our fortune give:\nAway, my lord, away!\nExeunt",

    "content":"SCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's.\nAlarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours\nYORK\nOf Salisbury, who can report of him,\nThat winter lion, who in rage forgets\nAged contusions and all brush of time,\nAnd, like a gallant in the brow of youth,\nRepairs him with occasion? This happy day\nIs not itself, nor have we won one foot,\nIf Salisbury be lost.\nRICHARD\nMy noble father,\nThree times to-day I holp him to his horse,\nThree times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,\nPersuaded him from any further act:\nBut still, where danger was, still there I met him;\nAnd like rich hangings in a homely house,\nSo was his will in his old feeble body.\nBut, noble as he is, look where he comes.\nEnter SALISBURY\n\nSALISBURY\nNow, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;\nBy the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:\nGod knows how long it is I have to live;\nAnd it hath pleased him that three times to-day\nYou have defended me from imminent death.\nWell, lords, we have not got that which we have:\n'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,\nBeing opposites of such repairing nature.\nYORK\nI know our safety is to follow them;\nFor, as I hear, the king is fled to London,\nTo call a present court of parliament.\nLet us pursue him ere the writs go forth.\nWhat says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?\nWARWICK\nAfter them! nay, before them, if we can.\nNow, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:\nSaint Alban's battle won by famous York\nShall be eternized in all age to come.\nSound drums and trumpets, and to London all:\nAnd more such days as these to us befall!\nExeunt",
