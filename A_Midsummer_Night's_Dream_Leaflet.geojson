    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Athens. A room in the Palace of Theseus\nEnter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate and Attendants.\n\nTHESEUS.\nNow, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour\nDraws on apace; four happy days bring in\nAnother moon; but oh, methinks, how slow\nThis old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,\nLike to a step-dame or a dowager,\nLong withering out a young man’s revenue.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\nNew bent in heaven, shall behold the night\nOf our solemnities.\n\nTHESEUS.\nGo, Philostrate,\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments;\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals;\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\n\n[Exit Philostrate.]\n\nHippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries;\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.\n\nEnter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.\n\nEGEUS.\nHappy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!\n\nTHESEUS.\nThanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?\n\nEGEUS.\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.\nStand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.\nStand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,\nThis man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,\nAnd interchang’d love-tokens with my child.\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung,\nWith feigning voice, verses of feigning love;\nAnd stol’n the impression of her fantasy\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers\nOf strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)\nWith cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,\nTurn’d her obedience (which is due to me)\nTo stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,\nBe it so she will not here before your grace\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\nAs she is mine I may dispose of her;\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\nOr to her death, according to our law\nImmediately provided in that case.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.\nTo you your father should be as a god;\nOne that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\nTo leave the figure, or disfigure it.\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHERMIA.\nSo is Lysander.\n\nTHESEUS.\nIn himself he is.\nBut in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,\nThe other must be held the worthier.\n\nHERMIA.\nI would my father look’d but with my eyes.\n\nTHESEUS.\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHERMIA.\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\nNor how it may concern my modesty\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts:\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\nThe worst that may befall me in this case,\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTHESEUS.\nEither to die the death, or to abjure\nFor ever the society of men.\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\nWhether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\nThrice-blessèd they that master so their blood\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distill’d\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\nGrows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.\n\nHERMIA.\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\nUnto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\n\nTHESEUS.\nTake time to pause; and by the next new moon\nThe sealing-day betwixt my love and me\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship,\nUpon that day either prepare to die\nFor disobedience to your father’s will,\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would,\nOr on Diana’s altar to protest\nFor aye austerity and single life.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nRelent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield\nThy crazèd title to my certain right.\n\nLYSANDER.\nYou have her father’s love, Demetrius.\nLet me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.\n\nEGEUS.\nScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him;\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\n\nLYSANDER.\nI am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,\nAs well possess’d; my love is more than his;\nMy fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,\nIf not with vantage, as Demetrius’;\nAnd, which is more than all these boasts can be,\nI am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\nDemetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,\nMade love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\n\nTHESEUS.\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\nBut, being over-full of self-affairs,\nMy mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\nI have some private schooling for you both.—\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\nTo fit your fancies to your father’s will,\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up\n(Which by no means we may extenuate)\nTo death, or to a vow of single life.\nCome, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along;\nI must employ you in some business\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\n\nEGEUS.\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\n\n[Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia.]\n\nLYSANDER.\nHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\n\nHERMIA.\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\n\nLYSANDER.\nAy me! For aught that I could ever read,\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\nBut either it was different in blood—\n\nHERMIA.\nO cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.\n\nLYSANDER.\nOr else misgraffèd in respect of years—\n\nHERMIA.\nO spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.\n\nLYSANDER.\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends—\n\nHERMIA.\nO hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!\n\nLYSANDER.\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\nMaking it momentany as a sound,\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\nAnd, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up:\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\n\nHERMIA.\nIf then true lovers have ever cross’d,\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\nThen let us teach our trial patience,\nBecause it is a customary cross,\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\nWishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.\n\nLYSANDER.\nA good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,\nSteal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town\n(Where I did meet thee once with Helena\nTo do observance to a morn of May),\nThere will I stay for thee.\n\nHERMIA.\nMy good Lysander!\nI swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\nBy the simplicity of Venus’ doves,\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\nAnd by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke\n(In number more than ever women spoke),\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\n\nLYSANDER.\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\n\nEnter Helena.\n\nHERMIA.\nGod speed fair Helena! Whither away?\n\nHELENA.\nCall you me fair? That fair again unsay.\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\nYour eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\nSickness is catching. O were favour so,\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\nMy tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\nThe rest I’d give to be to you translated.\nO, teach me how you look, and with what art\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!\n\nHERMIA.\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\n\nHELENA.\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\n\nHERMIA.\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\n\nHELENA.\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\n\nHERMIA.\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\n\nHELENA.\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\n\nHERMIA.\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\n\nHELENA.\nNone but your beauty; would that fault were mine!\n\nHERMIA.\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face;\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\nSeem’d Athens as a paradise to me.\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\nThat he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!\n\nLYSANDER.\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:\nTomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\n(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),\nThrough Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.\n\nHERMIA.\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet,\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\nFrom lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.\n\nLYSANDER.\nI will, my Hermia.\n[Exit Hermia.]\n\nHelena, adieu.\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\n\n[Exit Lysander.]\n\nHELENA.\nHow happy some o’er other some can be!\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\nAnd therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.\nNor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\nAnd therefore is love said to be a child,\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguil’d.\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\nSo the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.\nFor, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,\nHe hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\nSo he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt.\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\nPursue her; and for this intelligence\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\n\n[Exit Helena.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage\nEnter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout and Starveling.\n\nQUINCE.\nIs all our company here?\n\nBOTTOM.\nYou were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.\n\nQUINCE.\nHere is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on his wedding-day at night.\n\nBOTTOM.\nFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.\n\nQUINCE.\nMarry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe.\n\nBOTTOM.\nA very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.\n\nQUINCE.\nAnswer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\n\nBOTTOM.\nReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhat is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?\n\nQUINCE.\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\n\nBOTTOM.\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.\n\n    The raging rocks\n    And shivering shocks\n    Shall break the locks\n           Of prison gates,\n    And Phibbus’ car\n    Shall shine from far,\n    And make and mar\n           The foolish Fates.\n\nThis was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.\n\nQUINCE.\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\n\nFLUTE.\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE.\nFlute, you must take Thisbe on you.\n\nFLUTE.\nWhat is Thisbe? A wandering knight?\n\nQUINCE.\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\n\nFLUTE.\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.\n\nQUINCE.\nThat’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.\n\nBOTTOM.\nAnd I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! thy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!’\n\nQUINCE.\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWell, proceed.\n\nQUINCE.\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\n\nSTARVELING.\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE.\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.\nTom Snout, the tinker.\n\nSNOUT\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father;\nSnug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope here is a play fitted.\n\nSNUG\nHave you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\n\nBOTTOM.\nLet me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say ‘Let him roar again, let him roar again.’\n\nQUINCE.\nIf you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.\n\nALL\nThat would hang us every mother’s son.\n\nBOTTOM.\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.\n\nQUINCE.\nYou can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\n\nQUINCE.\nWhy, what you will.\n\nBOTTOM.\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.\n\nQUINCE.\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWe will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfect; adieu.\n\nQUINCE.\nAt the Duke’s oak we meet.\n\nBOTTOM.\nEnough. Hold, or cut bow-strings.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Are not you he\nThat frights the maidens of the villagery,\nSkim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,\nAnd bootless make the breathless housewife churn,\nAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm,\nMislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?\nThose that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,\nYou do their work, and they shall have good luck.\nAre not you he?\n\nPUCK.\nThou speak’st aright;\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\nI jest to Oberon, and make him smile,\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\nNeighing in likeness of a filly foal;\nAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab,\nAnd, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,\nAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\nThe wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\nSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\nThen slip I from her bum, down topples she,\nAnd ‘tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough;\nAnd then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe\nAnd waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear\nA merrier hour was never wasted there.\nBut room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.\nFAIRY\nAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\n\nEnter Oberon at one door, with his Train, and Titania at another, with hers.\n\nOBERON.\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\n\nTITANIA.\nWhat, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\n\nOBERON.\nTarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?\n\nTITANIA.\nThen I must be thy lady; but I know\nWhen thou hast stol’n away from fairyland,\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\nPlaying on pipes of corn, and versing love\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\nYour buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,\nTo Theseus must be wedded; and you come\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\n\nOBERON.\nHow canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night\nFrom Perigenia, whom he ravished?\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA.\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy:\nAnd never, since the middle summer’s spring,\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\nBy pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,\nOr on the beachèd margent of the sea,\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\nAs in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea\nContagious fogs; which, falling in the land,\nHath every pelting river made so proud\nThat they have overborne their continents.\nThe ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,\nThe ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn\nHath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.\nThe fold stands empty in the drownèd field,\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\nThe nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud,\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blest.\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;\nAnd on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\nTheir wonted liveries; and the mazed world,\nBy their increase, now knows not which is which.\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\nWe are their parents and original.\n\nOBERON.\nDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\nTo be my henchman.\n\nTITANIA.\nSet your heart at rest;\nThe fairyland buys not the child of me.\nHis mother was a vot’ress of my order,\nAnd in the spicèd Indian air, by night,\nFull often hath she gossip’d by my side;\nAnd sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,\nMarking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,\nWhen we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive,\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait\nFollowing (her womb then rich with my young squire),\nWould imitate, and sail upon the land,\nTo fetch me trifles, and return again,\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy,\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\n\nOBERON.\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\n\nTITANIA.\nPerchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.\nIf you will patiently dance in our round,\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us;\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n\nOBERON.\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\n\nTITANIA.\nNot for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.\nWe shall chide downright if I longer stay.\n\n[Exit Titania with her Train.]\n\nOBERON.\nWell, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove\nTill I torment thee for this injury.—\nMy gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest\nSince once I sat upon a promontory,\nAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back\nUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\nThat the rude sea grew civil at her song\nAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres\nTo hear the sea-maid’s music.\n\nPUCK.\nI remember.\n\nOBERON.\nThat very time I saw, (but thou couldst not),\nFlying between the cold moon and the earth,\nCupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took\nAt a fair vestal, thronèd by the west,\nAnd loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow\nAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\nBut I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft\nQuench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon;\nAnd the imperial votress passed on,\nIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.\nYet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\nBefore milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,\nAnd maidens call it love-in-idleness.\nFetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\nUpon the next live creature that it sees.\nFetch me this herb, and be thou here again\nEre the leviathan can swim a league.\n\nPUCK.\nI’ll put a girdle round about the earth\nIn forty minutes.\n\n[Exit Puck.]\n\nOBERON.\nHaving once this juice,\nI’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,\nAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes:\nThe next thing then she waking looks upon\n(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\nOn meddling monkey, or on busy ape)\nShe shall pursue it with the soul of love.\nAnd ere I take this charm from off her sight\n(As I can take it with another herb)\nI’ll make her render up her page to me.\nBut who comes here? I am invisible;\nAnd I will overhear their conference.\n\nEnter Demetrius, Helena following him.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI love thee not, therefore pursue me not.\nWhere is Lysander and fair Hermia?\nThe one I’ll slay, the other slayeth me.\nThou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood,\nAnd here am I, and wode within this wood\nBecause I cannot meet with Hermia.\nHence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\n\nHELENA.\nYou draw me, you hard-hearted adamant,\nBut yet you draw not iron, for my heart\nIs true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,\nAnd I shall have no power to follow you.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nDo I entice you? Do I speak you fair?\nOr rather do I not in plainest truth\nTell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?\n\nHELENA.\nAnd even for that do I love you the more.\nI am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,\nThe more you beat me, I will fawn on you.\nUse me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,\nNeglect me, lose me; only give me leave,\nUnworthy as I am, to follow you.\nWhat worser place can I beg in your love,\n(And yet a place of high respect with me)\nThan to be usèd as you use your dog?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;\nFor I am sick when I do look on thee.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd I am sick when I look not on you.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nYou do impeach your modesty too much\nTo leave the city and commit yourself\nInto the hands of one that loves you not,\nTo trust the opportunity of night\nAnd the ill counsel of a desert place,\nWith the rich worth of your virginity.\n\nHELENA.\nYour virtue is my privilege: for that\nIt is not night when I do see your face,\nTherefore I think I am not in the night;\nNor doth this wood lack worlds of company,\nFor you, in my respect, are all the world.\nThen how can it be said I am alone\nWhen all the world is here to look on me?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,\nAnd leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.\n\nHELENA.\nThe wildest hath not such a heart as you.\nRun when you will, the story shall be chang’d;\nApollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;\nThe dove pursues the griffin, the mild hind\nMakes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed,\nWhen cowardice pursues and valour flies!\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI will not stay thy questions. Let me go,\nOr if thou follow me, do not believe\nBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\n\nHELENA.\nAy, in the temple, in the town, the field,\nYou do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!\nYour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.\nWe cannot fight for love as men may do.\nWe should be woo’d, and were not made to woo.\n[Exit Demetrius.]\n\nI’ll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,\nTo die upon the hand I love so well.\n\n[Exit Helena.]\n\nOBERON.\nFare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,\nThou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.\n\nEnter Puck.\n\nHast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.\n\nPUCK.\nAy, there it is.\n\nOBERON.\nI pray thee give it me.\nI know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\nWhere oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\nQuite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,\nWith sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.\nThere sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\nLull’d in these flowers with dances and delight;\nAnd there the snake throws her enamell’d skin,\nWeed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.\nAnd with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,\nAnd make her full of hateful fantasies.\nTake thou some of it, and seek through this grove:\nA sweet Athenian lady is in love\nWith a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes;\nBut do it when the next thing he espies\nMay be the lady. Thou shalt know the man\nBy the Athenian garments he hath on.\nEffect it with some care, that he may prove\nMore fond on her than she upon her love:\nAnd look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.\n\nPUCK.\nFear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT III\nSCENE I. The Wood.\nThe Queen of Fairies still lying asleep.\n\nEnter Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug and Flute.\n\nBOTTOM.\nAre we all met?\n\nQUINCE.\nPat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.\n\nBOTTOM.\nPeter Quince?\n\nQUINCE.\nWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM.\nThere are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?\n\nSNOUT\nBy’r lakin, a parlous fear.\n\nSTARVELING.\nI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNot a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.\n\nQUINCE.\nWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight and six.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\n\nSNOUT\nWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\n\nSTARVELING.\nI fear it, I promise you.\n\nBOTTOM.\nMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to it.\n\nSNOUT\nTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: ‘Ladies,’ or, ‘Fair ladies, I would wish you,’ or, ‘I would request you,’ or, ’I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.\n\nQUINCE.\nWell, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber, for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.\n\nSNOUT\nDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\n\nBOTTOM.\nA calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find out moonshine.\n\nQUINCE.\nYes, it doth shine that night.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.\n\nQUINCE.\nAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.\n\nSNOUT\nYou can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM.\nSome man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.\n\nQUINCE.\nIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.\n\nEnter Puck behind.\n\nPUCK.\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\nSo near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?\nWhat, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor;\nAn actor too perhaps, if I see cause.\n\nQUINCE.\nSpeak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, stand forth.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nThisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet\n\nQUINCE.\nOdours, odours.\n\nPYRAMUS.\n. . . odours savours sweet.\nSo hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.\nBut hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,\nAnd by and by I will to thee appear.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPUCK.\nA stranger Pyramus than e’er played here!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTHISBE.\nMust I speak now?\n\nQUINCE.\nAy, marry, must you, For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.\n\nTHISBE.\nMost radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,\nOf colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,\nMost brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,\nAs true as truest horse, that yet would never tire,\nI’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.\n\nQUINCE.\nNinus’ tomb, man! Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues, and all.—Pyramus enter! Your cue is past; it is ‘never tire.’\n\nTHISBE.\nO, As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.\n\nEnter Puck and Bottom with an ass’s head.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nIf I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine.\n\nQUINCE.\nO monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters, fly, masters! Help!\n\n[Exeunt Clowns.]\n\nPUCK.\nI’ll follow you. I’ll lead you about a round,\n   Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;\nSometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,\n   A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;\nAnd neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,\nLike horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhy do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.\n\nEnter Snout.\n\nSNOUT\nO Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on thee?\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhat do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?\n\n[Exit Snout.]\n\nEnter Quince.\n\nQUINCE.\nBless thee, Bottom! bless thee! Thou art translated.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBOTTOM.\nI see their knavery. This is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can. I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.\n[Sings.]\n       The ousel cock, so black of hue,\n          With orange-tawny bill,\n       The throstle with his note so true,\n          The wren with little quill.\n\nTITANIA.\n[Waking.] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?\n\nBOTTOM.\n[Sings.]\n       The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,\n          The plain-song cuckoo gray,\n       Whose note full many a man doth mark,\n          And dares not answer nay.\nfor, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? Who would give a bird the lie, though he cry ‘cuckoo’ never so?\n\nTITANIA.\nI pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.\nMine ear is much enamour’d of thy note.\nSo is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape;\nAnd thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me,\nOn the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.\n\nBOTTOM.\nMethinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays. The more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.\n\nTITANIA.\nThou art as wise as thou art beautiful.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNot so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.\n\nTITANIA.\nOut of this wood do not desire to go.\nThou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.\nI am a spirit of no common rate.\nThe summer still doth tend upon my state;\nAnd I do love thee: therefore, go with me.\nI’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee;\nAnd they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,\nAnd sing, while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep.\nAnd I will purge thy mortal grossness so\nThat thou shalt like an airy spirit go.—\nPeaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!\n\nEnter four Fairies.\n\nPEASEBLOSSOM.\nReady.\nCOBWEB.\nAnd I.\nMOTH.\nAnd I.\nMUSTARDSEED.\nAnd I.\nALL.\nWhere shall we go?\n\nTITANIA.\nBe kind and courteous to this gentleman;\nHop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;\nFeed him with apricocks and dewberries,\nWith purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;\nThe honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,\nAnd for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs,\nAnd light them at the fiery glow-worm’s eyes,\nTo have my love to bed and to arise;\nAnd pluck the wings from painted butterflies,\nTo fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.\nNod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.\nPEASEBLOSSOM.\nHail, mortal!\nCOBWEB.\nHail!\nMOTH.\nHail!\nMUSTARDSEED.\nHail!\n\nBOTTOM.\nI cry your worships mercy, heartily.—I beseech your worship’s name.\n\nCOBWEB.\nCobweb.\n\nBOTTOM.\nI shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.—Your name, honest gentleman?\n\nPEASEBLOSSOM.\nPeaseblossom.\n\nBOTTOM.\nI pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.—Your name, I beseech you, sir?\n\nMUSTARDSEED.\nMustardseed.\n\nBOTTOM.\nGood Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well. That same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.\n\nTITANIA.\nCome, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.\n   The moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye,\nAnd when she weeps, weeps every little flower,\n   Lamenting some enforced chastity.\nTie up my love’s tongue, bring him silently.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

How now, mad spirit?\nWhat night-rule now about this haunted grove?\n\nPUCK.\nMy mistress with a monster is in love.\nNear to her close and consecrated bower,\nWhile she was in her dull and sleeping hour,\nA crew of patches, rude mechanicals,\nThat work for bread upon Athenian stalls,\nWere met together to rehearse a play\nIntended for great Theseus’ nuptial day.\nThe shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort\nWho Pyramus presented in their sport,\nForsook his scene and enter’d in a brake.\nWhen I did him at this advantage take,\nAn ass’s nole I fixed on his head.\nAnon, his Thisbe must be answerèd,\nAnd forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,\nAs wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,\nOr russet-pated choughs, many in sort,\nRising and cawing at the gun’s report,\nSever themselves and madly sweep the sky,\nSo at his sight away his fellows fly,\nAnd at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls;\nHe murder cries, and help from Athens calls.\nTheir sense thus weak, lost with their fears, thus strong,\nMade senseless things begin to do them wrong;\nFor briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;\nSome sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.\nI led them on in this distracted fear,\nAnd left sweet Pyramus translated there.\nWhen in that moment, so it came to pass,\nTitania wak’d, and straightway lov’d an ass.\n\nOBERON.\nThis falls out better than I could devise.\nBut hast thou yet latch’d the Athenian’s eyes\nWith the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?\n\nPUCK.\nI took him sleeping—that is finish’d too—\nAnd the Athenian woman by his side,\nThat, when he wak’d, of force she must be ey’d.\n\nEnter Demetrius and Hermia.\n\nOBERON.\nStand close.

Would he have stol’n away\nFrom sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon\nThis whole earth may be bor’d, and that the moon\nMay through the centre creep and so displease\nHer brother’s noontide with th’ Antipodes.\nIt cannot be but thou hast murder’d him.\nSo should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nSo should the murder’d look, and so should I,\nPierc’d through the heart with your stern cruelty.\nYet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,\nAs yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.\n\nHERMIA.\nWhat’s this to my Lysander?

Thou driv’st me past the bounds\nOf maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him, then?\nHenceforth be never number’d among men!\nO once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!\nDurst thou have look’d upon him, being awake,\nAnd hast thou kill’d him sleeping? O brave touch!\nCould not a worm, an adder, do so much?\nAn adder did it; for with doubler tongue\nThan thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nYou spend your passion on a mispris’d mood:\nI am not guilty of Lysander’s blood;\nNor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.\n\nHERMIA.\nI pray thee, tell me then that he is well.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAnd if I could, what should I get therefore?\n\nHERMIA.\nA privilege never to see me more.\nAnd from thy hated presence part I so:\nSee me no more, whether he be dead or no.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nThere is no following her in this fierce vein.\nHere, therefore, for a while I will remain.\nSo sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow\nFor debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;\nWhich now in some slight measure it will pay,\nIf for his tender here I make some stay.\n\n[Lies down.]\n\nOBERON.\nWhat hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,\nAnd laid the love-juice on some true-love’s sight.\nOf thy misprision must perforce ensue\nSome true love turn’d, and not a false turn’d true.\n\nPUCK.\nThen fate o’er-rules, that, one man holding troth,\nA million fail, confounding oath on oath.\n\nOBERON.\nAbout the wood go swifter than the wind,\nAnd Helena of Athens look thou find.\nAll fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer\nWith sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.\nBy some illusion see thou bring her here;\nI’ll charm his eyes against she do appear.\n\nPUCK.\nI go, I go; look how I go,\nSwifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOBERON.\n    Flower of this purple dye,\n    Hit with Cupid’s archery,\n    Sink in apple of his eye.\n    When his love he doth espy,\n    Let her shine as gloriously\n    As the Venus of the sky.—\n    When thou wak’st, if she be by,\n    Beg of her for remedy.\n\nEnter Puck.\n\nPUCK.\n    Captain of our fairy band,\n    Helena is here at hand,\n    And the youth mistook by me,\n    Pleading for a lover’s fee.\n    Shall we their fond pageant see?\n    Lord, what fools these mortals be!\n\nOBERON.\n    Stand aside. The noise they make\n    Will cause Demetrius to awake.\n\nPUCK.\n    Then will two at once woo one.\n    That must needs be sport alone;\n    And those things do best please me\n    That befall prepost’rously.\n\nEnter Lysander and Helena.\n\nLYSANDER.\nWhy should you think that I should woo in scorn?\nScorn and derision never come in tears.\nLook when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,\nIn their nativity all truth appears.\nHow can these things in me seem scorn to you,\nBearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?\n\nHELENA.\nYou do advance your cunning more and more.\nWhen truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!\nThese vows are Hermia’s: will you give her o’er?\nWeigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:\nYour vows to her and me, put in two scales,\nWill even weigh; and both as light as tales.\n\nLYSANDER.\nI had no judgment when to her I swore.\n\nHELENA.\nNor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er.\n\nLYSANDER.\nDemetrius loves her, and he loves not you.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\n[Waking.] O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!\nTo what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?\nCrystal is muddy. O how ripe in show\nThy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!\nThat pure congealèd white, high Taurus’ snow,\nFann’d with the eastern wind, turns to a crow\nWhen thou hold’st up thy hand. O, let me kiss\nThis princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!\n\nHELENA.\nO spite! O hell! I see you all are bent\nTo set against me for your merriment.\nIf you were civil, and knew courtesy,\nYou would not do me thus much injury.\nCan you not hate me, as I know you do,\nBut you must join in souls to mock me too?\nIf you were men, as men you are in show,\nYou would not use a gentle lady so;\nTo vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,\nWhen I am sure you hate me with your hearts.\nYou both are rivals, and love Hermia;\nAnd now both rivals, to mock Helena.\nA trim exploit, a manly enterprise,\nTo conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes\nWith your derision! None of noble sort\nWould so offend a virgin, and extort\nA poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport.\n\nLYSANDER.\nYou are unkind, Demetrius; be not so,\nFor you love Hermia; this you know I know.\nAnd here, with all good will, with all my heart,\nIn Hermia’s love I yield you up my part;\nAnd yours of Helena to me bequeath,\nWhom I do love and will do till my death.\n\nHELENA.\nNever did mockers waste more idle breath.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nLysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none.\nIf e’er I lov’d her, all that love is gone.\nMy heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn’d;\nAnd now to Helen is it home return’d,\nThere to remain.\n\nLYSANDER.\nHelen, it is not so.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nDisparage not the faith thou dost not know,\nLest to thy peril thou aby it dear.\nLook where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.\n\nEnter Hermia.\n\nHERMIA.\nDark night, that from the eye his function takes,\nThe ear more quick of apprehension makes;\nWherein it doth impair the seeing sense,\nIt pays the hearing double recompense.\nThou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;\nMine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.\nBut why unkindly didst thou leave me so?\n\nLYSANDER.\nWhy should he stay whom love doth press to go?\n\nHERMIA.\nWhat love could press Lysander from my side?\n\nLYSANDER.\nLysander’s love, that would not let him bide,\nFair Helena, who more engilds the night\nThan all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.\nWhy seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee know\nThe hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?\n\nHERMIA.\nYou speak not as you think; it cannot be.\n\nHELENA.\nLo, she is one of this confederacy!\nNow I perceive they have conjoin’d all three\nTo fashion this false sport in spite of me.\nInjurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid!\nHave you conspir’d, have you with these contriv’d,\nTo bait me with this foul derision?\nIs all the counsel that we two have shar’d,\nThe sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,\nWhen we have chid the hasty-footed time\nFor parting us—O, is all forgot?\nAll school-days’ friendship, childhood innocence?\nWe, Hermia, like two artificial gods,\nHave with our needles created both one flower,\nBoth on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\nBoth warbling of one song, both in one key,\nAs if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,\nHad been incorporate. So we grew together,\nLike to a double cherry, seeming parted,\nBut yet a union in partition,\nTwo lovely berries moulded on one stem;\nSo, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;\nTwo of the first, like coats in heraldry,\nDue but to one, and crownèd with one crest.\nAnd will you rent our ancient love asunder,\nTo join with men in scorning your poor friend?\nIt is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.\nOur sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\nThough I alone do feel the injury.\n\nHERMIA.\nI am amazèd at your passionate words:\nI scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.\n\nHELENA.\nHave you not set Lysander, as in scorn,\nTo follow me, and praise my eyes and face?\nAnd made your other love, Demetrius,\nWho even but now did spurn me with his foot,\nTo call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,\nPrecious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this\nTo her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander\nDeny your love, so rich within his soul,\nAnd tender me, forsooth, affection,\nBut by your setting on, by your consent?\nWhat though I be not so in grace as you,\nSo hung upon with love, so fortunate,\nBut miserable most, to love unlov’d?\nThis you should pity rather than despise.\n\nHERMIA.\nI understand not what you mean by this.\n\nHELENA.\nAy, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,\nMake mouths upon me when I turn my back,\nWink each at other; hold the sweet jest up.\nThis sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.\nIf you have any pity, grace, or manners,\nYou would not make me such an argument.\nBut fare ye well. ’Tis partly my own fault,\nWhich death, or absence, soon shall remedy.\n\nLYSANDER.\nStay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;\nMy love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!\n\nHELENA.\nO excellent!\n\nHERMIA.\nSweet, do not scorn her so.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nIf she cannot entreat, I can compel.\n\nLYSANDER.\nThou canst compel no more than she entreat;\nThy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.\nHelen, I love thee, by my life I do;\nI swear by that which I will lose for thee\nTo prove him false that says I love thee not.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI say I love thee more than he can do.\n\nLYSANDER.\nIf thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nQuick, come.\n\nHERMIA.\nLysander, whereto tends all this?\n\nLYSANDER.\nAway, you Ethiope!\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo, no. He will\nSeem to break loose. Take on as you would follow,\nBut yet come not. You are a tame man, go!\n\nLYSANDER.\nHang off, thou cat, thou burr! Vile thing, let loose,\nOr I will shake thee from me like a serpent.\n\nHERMIA.\nWhy are you grown so rude? What change is this,\nSweet love?\n\nLYSANDER.\nThy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out!\nOut, loathèd medicine! O hated potion, hence!\n\nHERMIA.\nDo you not jest?\n\nHELENA.\nYes, sooth, and so do you.\n\nLYSANDER.\nDemetrius, I will keep my word with thee.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nI would I had your bond; for I perceive\nA weak bond holds you; I’ll not trust your word.\n\nLYSANDER.\nWhat, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?\nAlthough I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.\n\nHERMIA.\nWhat, can you do me greater harm than hate?\nHate me? Wherefore? O me! what news, my love?\nAm not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?\nI am as fair now as I was erewhile.\nSince night you lov’d me; yet since night you left me.\nWhy then, you left me—O, the gods forbid!—\nIn earnest, shall I say?\n\nLYSANDER.\nAy, by my life;\nAnd never did desire to see thee more.\nTherefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;\nBe certain, nothing truer; ’tis no jest\nThat I do hate thee and love Helena.\n\nHERMIA.\nO me! You juggler! You cankerblossom!\nYou thief of love! What! have you come by night\nAnd stol’n my love’s heart from him?\n\nHELENA.\nFine, i’ faith!\nHave you no modesty, no maiden shame,\nNo touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear\nImpatient answers from my gentle tongue?\nFie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!\n\nHERMIA.\nPuppet! Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.\nNow I perceive that she hath made compare\nBetween our statures; she hath urg’d her height;\nAnd with her personage, her tall personage,\nHer height, forsooth, she hath prevail’d with him.\nAnd are you grown so high in his esteem\nBecause I am so dwarfish and so low?\nHow low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak,\nHow low am I? I am not yet so low\nBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.\n\nHELENA.\nI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,\nLet her not hurt me. I was never curst;\nI have no gift at all in shrewishness;\nI am a right maid for my cowardice;\nLet her not strike me. You perhaps may think,\nBecause she is something lower than myself,\nThat I can match her.\n\nHERMIA.\nLower! Hark, again.\n\nHELENA.\nGood Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.\nI evermore did love you, Hermia,\nDid ever keep your counsels, never wrong’d you,\nSave that, in love unto Demetrius,\nI told him of your stealth unto this wood.\nHe follow’d you; for love I follow’d him;\nBut he hath chid me hence, and threaten’d me\nTo strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:\nAnd now, so you will let me quiet go,\nTo Athens will I bear my folly back,\nAnd follow you no further. Let me go:\nYou see how simple and how fond I am.\n\nHERMIA.\nWhy, get you gone. Who is’t that hinders you?\n\nHELENA.\nA foolish heart that I leave here behind.\n\nHERMIA.\nWhat! with Lysander?\n\nHELENA.\nWith Demetrius.\n\nLYSANDER.\nBe not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.\n\nHELENA.\nO, when she’s angry, she is keen and shrewd.\nShe was a vixen when she went to school,\nAnd though she be but little, she is fierce.\n\nHERMIA.\nLittle again! Nothing but low and little?\nWhy will you suffer her to flout me thus?\nLet me come to her.\n\nLYSANDER.\nGet you gone, you dwarf;\nYou minimus, of hind’ring knot-grass made;\nYou bead, you acorn.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nYou are too officious\nIn her behalf that scorns your services.\nLet her alone. Speak not of Helena;\nTake not her part; for if thou dost intend\nNever so little show of love to her,\nThou shalt aby it.\n\nLYSANDER.\nNow she holds me not.\nNow follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,\nOf thine or mine, is most in Helena.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nFollow! Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jole.\n\n[Exeunt Lysander and Demetrius.]\n\nHERMIA.\nYou, mistress, all this coil is long of you.\nNay, go not back.\n\nHELENA.\nI will not trust you, I,\nNor longer stay in your curst company.\nYour hands than mine are quicker for a fray.\nMy legs are longer though, to run away.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nHERMIA.\nI am amaz’d, and know not what to say.\n[Exit, pursuing Helena.]\n\nOBERON.\nThis is thy negligence: still thou mistak’st,\nOr else commit’st thy knaveries willfully.\n\nPUCK.\nBelieve me, king of shadows, I mistook.\nDid not you tell me I should know the man\nBy the Athenian garments he had on?\nAnd so far blameless proves my enterprise\nThat I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes:\nAnd so far am I glad it so did sort,\nAs this their jangling I esteem a sport.\n\nOBERON.\nThou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.\nHie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;\nThe starry welkin cover thou anon\nWith drooping fog, as black as Acheron,\nAnd lead these testy rivals so astray\nAs one come not within another’s way.\nLike to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,\nThen stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;\nAnd sometime rail thou like Demetrius.\nAnd from each other look thou lead them thus,\nTill o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep\nWith leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.\nThen crush this herb into Lysander’s eye,\nWhose liquor hath this virtuous property,\nTo take from thence all error with his might\nAnd make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.\nWhen they next wake, all this derision\nShall seem a dream and fruitless vision;\nAnd back to Athens shall the lovers wend,\nWith league whose date till death shall never end.\nWhiles I in this affair do thee employ,\nI’ll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;\nAnd then I will her charmèd eye release\nFrom monster’s view, and all things shall be peace.\n\nPUCK.\nMy fairy lord, this must be done with haste,\nFor night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast;\nAnd yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger,\nAt whose approach, ghosts wandering here and there\nTroop home to churchyards. Damnèd spirits all,\nThat in cross-ways and floods have burial,\nAlready to their wormy beds are gone;\nFor fear lest day should look their shames upon,\nThey wilfully themselves exile from light,\nAnd must for aye consort with black-brow’d night.\n\nOBERON.\nBut we are spirits of another sort:\nI with the morning’s love have oft made sport;\nAnd, like a forester, the groves may tread\nEven till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,\nOpening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams,\nTurns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.\nBut, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay.\nWe may effect this business yet ere day.\n\n[Exit Oberon.]\n\nPUCK.\n    Up and down, up and down,\n    I will lead them up and down.\n    I am fear’d in field and town.\n    Goblin, lead them up and down.\nHere comes one.\n\nEnter Lysander.\n\nLYSANDER.\nWhere art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.\n\nPUCK.\nHere, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?\n\nLYSANDER.\nI will be with thee straight.\n\nPUCK.\nFollow me then to plainer ground.\n\n[Exit Lysander as following the voice.]\n\nEnter Demetrius.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nLysander, speak again.\nThou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?\nSpeak. In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?\n\nPUCK.\nThou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,\nTelling the bushes that thou look’st for wars,\nAnd wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child!\nI’ll whip thee with a rod. He is defil’d\nThat draws a sword on thee.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nYea, art thou there?\n\nPUCK.\nFollow my voice; we’ll try no manhood here.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nEnter Lysander.\n\nLYSANDER.\nHe goes before me, and still dares me on;\nWhen I come where he calls, then he is gone.\nThe villain is much lighter-heel’d than I:\nI follow’d fast, but faster he did fly,\nThat fallen am I in dark uneven way,\nAnd here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day!\n[Lies down.] For if but once thou show me thy grey light,\nI’ll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.\n\n[Sleeps.]\n\nEnter Puck and Demetrius.\n\nPUCK.\nHo, ho, ho! Coward, why com’st thou not?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAbide me, if thou dar’st; for well I wot\nThou runn’st before me, shifting every place,\nAnd dar’st not stand, nor look me in the face.\nWhere art thou?\n\nPUCK.\nCome hither; I am here.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNay, then, thou mock’st me. Thou shalt buy this dear\nIf ever I thy face by daylight see:\nNow go thy way. Faintness constraineth me\nTo measure out my length on this cold bed.\nBy day’s approach look to be visited.\n\n[Lies down and sleeps.]\n\nEnter Helena.\n\nHELENA.\nO weary night, O long and tedious night,\n    Abate thy hours! Shine, comforts, from the east,\nThat I may back to Athens by daylight,\n    From these that my poor company detest.\nAnd sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,\nSteal me awhile from mine own company.\n\n[Sleeps.]\n\nPUCK.\n    Yet but three? Come one more.\n    Two of both kinds makes up four.\n    Here she comes, curst and sad.\n    Cupid is a knavish lad\n    Thus to make poor females mad.\n\nEnter Hermia.\n\nHERMIA.\nNever so weary, never so in woe,\n   Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers,\nI can no further crawl, no further go;\n   My legs can keep no pace with my desires.\nHere will I rest me till the break of day.\nHeavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!\n\n[Lies down.]\n\nPUCK.\n         On the ground\n         Sleep sound.\n         I’ll apply\n         To your eye,\n       Gentle lover, remedy.\n\n[Squeezing the juice on Lysander’s eye.]\n\n         When thou wak’st,\n         Thou tak’st\n         True delight\n         In the sight\n       Of thy former lady’s eye.\n       And the country proverb known,\n       That every man should take his own,\n       In your waking shall be shown:\n         Jack shall have Jill;\n         Nought shall go ill;\nThe man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.\n\n[Exit Puck.]",

    "content":"ACT IV\nSCENE I. The Wood\nLysander, Demetrius, Helena and Hermia still asleep.\n\nEnter Titania and Bottom; Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseed and other Fairies attending; Oberon behind, unseen.\n\nTITANIA.\nCome, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,\n   While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,\nAnd stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,\n   And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.\n\nBOTTOM.\nWhere’s Peaseblossom?\n\nPEASEBLOSSOM.\nReady.\n\nBOTTOM.\nScratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?\n\nCOBWEB.\nReady.\n\nBOTTOM.\nMonsieur Cobweb; good monsieur, get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur; and, good monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior. Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed?\n\nMUSTARDSEED.\nReady.\n\nBOTTOM.\nGive me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed. Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.\n\nMUSTARDSEED.\nWhat’s your will?\n\nBOTTOM.\nNothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.\n\nTITANIA.\nWhat, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?\n\nBOTTOM.\nI have a reasonable good ear in music. Let us have the tongs and the bones.\nTITANIA.\nOr say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.\n\nBOTTOM.\nTruly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.\n\nTITANIA.\nI have a venturous fairy that shall seek\nThe squirrel’s hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.\n\nBOTTOM.\nI had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.\n\nTITANIA.\nSleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.\nFairies, be gone, and be all ways away.\nSo doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle\nGently entwist, the female ivy so\nEnrings the barky fingers of the elm.\nO, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!\n\n[They sleep.]\n\nOberon advances. Enter Puck.\n\nOBERON.\nWelcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?\nHer dotage now I do begin to pity.\nFor, meeting her of late behind the wood,\nSeeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,\nI did upbraid her and fall out with her:\nFor she his hairy temples then had rounded\nWith coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;\nAnd that same dew, which sometime on the buds\nWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls,\nStood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes,\nLike tears that did their own disgrace bewail.\nWhen I had at my pleasure taunted her,\nAnd she in mild terms begg’d my patience,\nI then did ask of her her changeling child;\nWhich straight she gave me, and her fairy sent\nTo bear him to my bower in fairyland.\nAnd now I have the boy, I will undo\nThis hateful imperfection of her eyes.\nAnd, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp\nFrom off the head of this Athenian swain,\nThat he awaking when the other do,\nMay all to Athens back again repair,\nAnd think no more of this night’s accidents\nBut as the fierce vexation of a dream.\nBut first I will release the Fairy Queen.\n[Touching her eyes with an herb.]\n\n    Be as thou wast wont to be;\n    See as thou was wont to see.\n    Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower\n    Hath such force and blessed power.\nNow, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.\n\nTITANIA.\nMy Oberon, what visions have I seen!\nMethought I was enamour’d of an ass.\n\nOBERON.\nThere lies your love.\n\nTITANIA.\nHow came these things to pass?\nO, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!\n\nOBERON.\nSilence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.\nTitania, music call; and strike more dead\nThan common sleep, of all these five the sense.\n\nTITANIA.\nMusic, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep.\n\nPUCK.\nNow when thou wak’st, with thine own fool’s eyes peep.\n\nOBERON.\nSound, music.\n[Still music.]\n\nCome, my queen, take hands with me,\nAnd rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\nNow thou and I are new in amity,\nAnd will tomorrow midnight solemnly\nDance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly,\nAnd bless it to all fair prosperity:\nThere shall the pairs of faithful lovers be\nWedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.\n\nPUCK.\n    Fairy king, attend and mark.\n    I do hear the morning lark.\n\nOBERON.\n    Then, my queen, in silence sad,\n    Trip we after night’s shade.\n    We the globe can compass soon,\n    Swifter than the wand’ring moon.\n\nTITANIA.\n    Come, my lord, and in our flight,\n    Tell me how it came this night\n    That I sleeping here was found\n    With these mortals on the ground.\n[Exeunt. Horns sound within.]\n\nEnter Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Train.\n\nTHESEUS.\nGo, one of you, find out the forester;\nFor now our observation is perform’d;\nAnd since we have the vaward of the day,\nMy love shall hear the music of my hounds.\nUncouple in the western valley; let them go.\nDispatch I say, and find the forester.\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nWe will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top,\nAnd mark the musical confusion\nOf hounds and echo in conjunction.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nI was with Hercules and Cadmus once,\nWhen in a wood of Crete they bay’d the bear\nWith hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear\nSuch gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,\nThe skies, the fountains, every region near\nSeem’d all one mutual cry. I never heard\nSo musical a discord, such sweet thunder.\n\nTHESEUS.\nMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\nSo flew’d, so sanded; and their heads are hung\nWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;\nCrook-knee’d and dewlap’d like Thessalian bulls;\nSlow in pursuit, but match’d in mouth like bells,\nEach under each. A cry more tuneable\nWas never holla’d to, nor cheer’d with horn,\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\nJudge when you hear.—But, soft, what nymphs are these?\n\nEGEUS.\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is;\nThis Helena, old Nedar’s Helena:\nI wonder of their being here together.\n\nTHESEUS.\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\nThe rite of May; and, hearing our intent,\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.\nBut speak, Egeus; is not this the day\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\n\nEGEUS.\nIt is, my lord.\n\nTHESEUS.\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\nHorns, and shout within. Demetrius, Lysander, Hermia and Helena wake and start up.\n\nGood morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.\nBegin these wood-birds but to couple now?\n\nLYSANDER.\nPardon, my lord.\n\nHe and the rest kneel to Theseus.\n\nTHESEUS.\nI pray you all, stand up.\nI know you two are rival enemies.\nHow comes this gentle concord in the world,\nThat hatred is so far from jealousy\nTo sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?\n\nLYSANDER.\nMy lord, I shall reply amazedly,\nHalf sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,\nI cannot truly say how I came here.\nBut, as I think (for truly would I speak)\nAnd now I do bethink me, so it is:\nI came with Hermia hither. Our intent\nWas to be gone from Athens, where we might be\nWithout the peril of the Athenian law.\n\nEGEUS.\nEnough, enough, my lord; you have enough.\nI beg the law, the law upon his head.\nThey would have stol’n away, they would, Demetrius,\nThereby to have defeated you and me:\nYou of your wife, and me of my consent,\nOf my consent that she should be your wife.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\nOf this their purpose hither to this wood;\nAnd I in fury hither follow’d them,\nFair Helena in fancy following me.\nBut, my good lord, I wot not by what power,\n(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,\nMelted as the snow, seems to me now\nAs the remembrance of an idle gaud\nWhich in my childhood I did dote upon;\nAnd all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\nThe object and the pleasure of mine eye,\nIs only Helena. To her, my lord,\nWas I betroth’d ere I saw Hermia.\nBut like a sickness did I loathe this food.\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\nAnd will for evermore be true to it.\n\nTHESEUS.\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met.\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.\nEgeus, I will overbear your will;\nFor in the temple, by and by with us,\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\nOur purpos’d hunting shall be set aside.\nAway with us to Athens. Three and three,\nWe’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.\nCome, Hippolyta.\n\n[Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Train.]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nThese things seem small and undistinguishable,\nLike far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.\n\nHERMIA.\nMethinks I see these things with parted eye,\nWhen everything seems double.\n\nHELENA.\nSo methinks.\nAnd I have found Demetrius like a jewel,\nMine own, and not mine own.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAre you sure\nThat we are awake? It seems to me\nThat yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think\nThe Duke was here, and bid us follow him?\n\nHERMIA.\nYea, and my father.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd Hippolyta.\n\nLYSANDER.\nAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWhy, then, we are awake: let’s follow him,\nAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nBOTTOM.\n[Waking.] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is ‘Most fair Pyramus.’ Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stol’n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be called ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.\n\n[Exit.]",

In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws.

    "content":"ACT V\nSCENE I. Athens. An Apartment in the Palace of Theseus\nEnter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, Lords and Attendants.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\n’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.\n\nTHESEUS.\nMore strange than true. I never may believe\nThese antique fables, nor these fairy toys.\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet\nAre of imagination all compact:\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold;\nThat is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,\nSees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt:\nThe poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen\nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\nA local habitation and a name.\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,\nThat if it would but apprehend some joy,\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy.\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear?\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nBut all the story of the night told over,\nAnd all their minds transfigur’d so together,\nMore witnesseth than fancy’s images,\nAnd grows to something of great constancy;\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\n\nEnter lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia and Helena.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHere come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.\nJoy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love\nAccompany your hearts!\n\nLYSANDER.\nMore than to us\nWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!\n\nTHESEUS.\nCome now; what masques, what dances shall we have,\nTo wear away this long age of three hours\nBetween our after-supper and bed-time?\nWhere is our usual manager of mirth?\nWhat revels are in hand? Is there no play\nTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour?\nCall Philostrate.\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nHere, mighty Theseus.\n\nTHESEUS.\nSay, what abridgment have you for this evening?\nWhat masque? What music? How shall we beguile\nThe lazy time, if not with some delight?\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nThere is a brief how many sports are ripe.\nMake choice of which your Highness will see first.\n[Giving a paper.]\n\nTHESEUS.\n[Reads] ‘The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung\nBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’\nWe’ll none of that. That have I told my love\nIn glory of my kinsman Hercules.\n‘The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,\nTearing the Thracian singer in their rage?’\nThat is an old device, and it was play’d\nWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.\n‘The thrice three Muses mourning for the death\nOf learning, late deceas’d in beggary.’\nThat is some satire, keen and critical,\nNot sorting with a nuptial ceremony.\n‘A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus\nAnd his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.’\nMerry and tragical? Tedious and brief?\nThat is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.\nHow shall we find the concord of this discord?\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nA play there is, my lord, some ten words long,\nWhich is as brief as I have known a play;\nBut by ten words, my lord, it is too long,\nWhich makes it tedious. For in all the play\nThere is not one word apt, one player fitted.\nAnd tragical, my noble lord, it is.\nFor Pyramus therein doth kill himself,\nWhich, when I saw rehears’d, I must confess,\nMade mine eyes water; but more merry tears\nThe passion of loud laughter never shed.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWhat are they that do play it?\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nHard-handed men that work in Athens here,\nWhich never labour’d in their minds till now;\nAnd now have toil’d their unbreath’d memories\nWith this same play against your nuptial.\n\nTHESEUS.\nAnd we will hear it.\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nNo, my noble lord,\nIt is not for you: I have heard it over,\nAnd it is nothing, nothing in the world;\nUnless you can find sport in their intents,\nExtremely stretch’d and conn’d with cruel pain\nTo do you service.\n\nTHESEUS.\nI will hear that play;\nFor never anything can be amiss\nWhen simpleness and duty tender it.\nGo, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.\n[Exit Philostrate.]\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nI love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged,\nAnd duty in his service perishing.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nHe says they can do nothing in this kind.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.\nOur sport shall be to take what they mistake:\nAnd what poor duty cannot do, noble respect\nTakes it in might, not merit.\nWhere I have come, great clerks have purposed\nTo greet me with premeditated welcomes;\nWhere I have seen them shiver and look pale,\nMake periods in the midst of sentences,\nThrottle their practis’d accent in their fears,\nAnd, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,\nNot paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,\nOut of this silence yet I pick’d a welcome;\nAnd in the modesty of fearful duty\nI read as much as from the rattling tongue\nOf saucy and audacious eloquence.\nLove, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity\nIn least speak most to my capacity.\n\nEnter Philostrate.\n\nPHILOSTRATE.\nSo please your grace, the Prologue is address’d.\n\nTHESEUS.\nLet him approach.\n\nFlourish of trumpets. Enter the Prologue.\n\nPROLOGUE\nIf we offend, it is with our good will.\nThat you should think, we come not to offend,\nBut with good will. To show our simple skill,\nThat is the true beginning of our end.\nConsider then, we come but in despite.\nWe do not come, as minding to content you,\nOur true intent is. All for your delight\nWe are not here. That you should here repent you,\nThe actors are at hand, and, by their show,\nYou shall know all that you are like to know.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThis fellow doth not stand upon points.\n\nLYSANDER.\nHe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nIndeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHis speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?\n\nEnter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine and Lion as in dumb show.\n\nPROLOGUE\nGentles, perchance you wonder at this show;\nBut wonder on, till truth make all things plain.\nThis man is Pyramus, if you would know;\nThis beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.\nThis man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present\nWall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;\nAnd through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are content\nTo whisper, at the which let no man wonder.\nThis man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,\nPresenteth Moonshine, for, if you will know,\nBy moonshine did these lovers think no scorn\nTo meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.\nThis grisly beast (which Lion hight by name)\nThe trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,\nDid scare away, or rather did affright;\nAnd as she fled, her mantle she did fall;\nWhich Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.\nAnon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,\nAnd finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain;\nWhereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,\nHe bravely broach’d his boiling bloody breast;\nAnd Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,\nHis dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\nLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,\nAt large discourse while here they do remain.\n\n[Exeunt Prologue, Pyramus, Thisbe, Lion and Moonshine.]\n\nTHESEUS.\nI wonder if the lion be to speak.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo wonder, my lord. One lion may, when many asses do.\n\nWALL.\nIn this same interlude it doth befall\nThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall:\nAnd such a wall as I would have you think\nThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\nThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,\nDid whisper often very secretly.\nThis loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show\nThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:\nAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\nThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.\n\nTHESEUS.\nPyramus draws near the wall; silence.\n\nEnter Pyramus.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nO grim-look’d night! O night with hue so black!\nO night, which ever art when day is not!\nO night, O night, alack, alack, alack,\nI fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot!\nAnd thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,\nThat stand’st between her father’s ground and mine;\nThou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,\nShow me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.\n\n[Wall holds up his fingers.]\n\nThanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!\nBut what see I? No Thisbe do I see.\nO wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,\nCurs’d be thy stones for thus deceiving me!\n\nTHESEUS.\nThe wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nNo, in truth, sir, he should not. ‘Deceiving me’ is Thisbe’s cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.\n\nEnter Thisbe.\n\nTHISBE.\nO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,\nFor parting my fair Pyramus and me.\nMy cherry lips have often kiss’d thy stones,\nThy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nI see a voice; now will I to the chink,\nTo spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.\nThisbe?\n\nTHISBE.\nMy love thou art, my love I think.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nThink what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace;\nAnd like Limander am I trusty still.\n\nTHISBE.\nAnd I like Helen, till the fates me kill.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\n\nTHISBE.\nAs Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nO kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.\n\nTHISBE.\nI kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nWilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?\n\nTHISBE.\n’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay.\n\nWALL.\nThus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;\nAnd, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\n\n[Exeunt Wall, Pyramus and Thisbe.]\n\nTHESEUS.\nNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nIt must be your imagination then, and not theirs.\n\nTHESEUS.\nIf we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.\n\nEnter Lion and Moonshine.\n\nLION.\nYou, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear\nThe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,\nMay now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,\nWhen lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.\nThen know that I, one Snug the joiner, am\nA lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam;\nFor if I should as lion come in strife\nInto this place, ’twere pity on my life.\n\nTHESEUS.\nA very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nThe very best at a beast, my lord, that e’er I saw.\n\nLYSANDER.\nThis lion is a very fox for his valour.\n\nTHESEUS.\nTrue; and a goose for his discretion.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNot so, my lord, for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHis discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for the goose carries not the fox. It is well; leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.\n\nMOONSHINE.\nThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nHe should have worn the horns on his head.\n\nTHESEUS.\nHe is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference.\n\nMOONSHINE.\nThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present;\nMyself the man i’ the moon do seem to be.\n\nTHESEUS.\nThis is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should be put into the lantern. How is it else the man i’ the moon?\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nHe dares not come there for the candle, for you see, it is already in snuff.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nI am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!\n\nTHESEUS.\nIt appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.\n\nLYSANDER.\nProceed, Moon.\n\nMOON.\nAll that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern is the moon; I the man i’ the moon; this thorn-bush my thorn-bush; and this dog my dog.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWhy, all these should be in the lantern, for all these are in the moon. But silence; here comes Thisbe.\n\nEnter Thisbe.\n\nTHISBE.\nThis is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?\n\nLION.\nOh!\n\n[The Lion roars, Thisbe runs off.]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nWell roared, Lion.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWell run, Thisbe.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nWell shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.\n\n[The Lion tears Thisbe’s mantle, and exit.]\n\nTHESEUS.\nWell moused, Lion.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAnd then came Pyramus.\n\nLYSANDER.\nAnd so the lion vanished.\n\nEnter Pyramus.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nSweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;\nI thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;\nFor, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,\nI trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.\n             But stay! O spite!\n             But mark, poor knight,\n         What dreadful dole is here!\n             Eyes, do you see?\n             How can it be?\n         O dainty duck! O dear!\n             Thy mantle good,\n             What, stained with blood?\n         Approach, ye Furies fell!\n             O Fates, come, come;\n             Cut thread and thrum;\n         Quail, rush, conclude, and quell!\n\nTHESEUS.\nThis passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nBeshrew my heart, but I pity the man.\n\nPYRAMUS.\nO wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,\nSince lion vile hath here deflower’d my dear?\nWhich is—no, no—which was the fairest dame\nThat liv’d, that lov’d, that lik’d, that look’d with cheer.\n             Come, tears, confound!\n             Out, sword, and wound\n         The pap of Pyramus;\n             Ay, that left pap,\n             Where heart doth hop:\n         Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.\n             Now am I dead,\n             Now am I fled;\n         My soul is in the sky.\n             Tongue, lose thy light!\n             Moon, take thy flight!\n         Now die, die, die, die, die.\n\n[Dies. Exit Moonshine.]\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nNo die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.\n\nLYSANDER.\nLess than an ace, man; for he is dead, he is nothing.\n\nTHESEUS.\nWith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nHow chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?\nTHESEUS.\nShe will find him by starlight.\n\nEnter Thisbe.\n\nHere she comes, and her passion ends the play.\n\nHIPPOLYTA.\nMethinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nA mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us!\n\nLYSANDER.\nShe hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAnd thus she means, videlicet—\n\nTHISBE.\n             Asleep, my love?\n             What, dead, my dove?\n         O Pyramus, arise,\n             Speak, speak. Quite dumb?\n             Dead, dead? A tomb\n         Must cover thy sweet eyes.\n             These lily lips,\n             This cherry nose,\n         These yellow cowslip cheeks,\n             Are gone, are gone!\n             Lovers, make moan;\n         His eyes were green as leeks.\n             O Sisters Three,\n             Come, come to me,\n         With hands as pale as milk;\n             Lay them in gore,\n             Since you have shore\n         With shears his thread of silk.\n             Tongue, not a word:\n             Come, trusty sword,\n         Come, blade, my breast imbrue;\n             And farewell, friends.\n             Thus Thisbe ends.\n         Adieu, adieu, adieu.\n\n[Dies.]\n\nTHESEUS.\nMoonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.\n\nDEMETRIUS.\nAy, and Wall too.\n\nBOTTOM.\nNo, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?\n\nTHESEUS.\nNo epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus, and hanged himself in Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine tragedy; and so it is, truly; and very notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.\n\n[Here a dance of Clowns.]\n\nThe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.\nLovers, to bed; ’tis almost fairy time.\nI fear we shall outsleep the coming morn\nAs much as we this night have overwatch’d.\nThis palpable-gross play hath well beguil’d\nThe heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.\nA fortnight hold we this solemnity\nIn nightly revels and new jollity.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nEnter Puck.\n\nPUCK.\n   Now the hungry lion roars,\n      And the wolf behowls the moon;\n   Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,\n      All with weary task fordone.\n   Now the wasted brands do glow,\n      Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,\n   Puts the wretch that lies in woe\n      In remembrance of a shroud.\n   Now it is the time of night\n      That the graves, all gaping wide,\n   Every one lets forth his sprite,\n      In the church-way paths to glide.\n   And we fairies, that do run\n      By the triple Hecate’s team\n   From the presence of the sun,\n      Following darkness like a dream,\n   Now are frolic; not a mouse\n      Shall disturb this hallow’d house.\n   I am sent with broom before,\n      To sweep the dust behind the door.\n\nEnter Oberon and Titania with their Train.\n\nOBERON.\n   Through the house give glimmering light,\n        By the dead and drowsy fire.\n   Every elf and fairy sprite\n        Hop as light as bird from brier,\n   And this ditty after me,\n   Sing and dance it trippingly.\n\nTITANIA.\n   First rehearse your song by rote,\n        To each word a warbling note;\n   Hand in hand, with fairy grace,\n   Will we sing, and bless this place.\n\n[Song and Dance.]\n\nOBERON.\n   Now, until the break of day,\n   Through this house each fairy stray.\n   To the best bride-bed will we,\n   Which by us shall blessèd be;\n   And the issue there create\n   Ever shall be fortunate.\n   So shall all the couples three\n   Ever true in loving be;\n   And the blots of Nature’s hand\n   Shall not in their issue stand:\n   Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,\n   Nor mark prodigious, such as are\n   Despised in nativity,\n   Shall upon their children be.\n   With this field-dew consecrate,\n   Every fairy take his gait,\n   And each several chamber bless,\n   Through this palace, with sweet peace;\n   And the owner of it blest.\n   Ever shall it in safety rest,\n   Trip away. Make no stay;\n   Meet me all by break of day.\n\n[Exeunt Oberon, Titania and Train.]\n\nPUCK.\n   If we shadows have offended,\n   Think but this, and all is mended,\n   That you have but slumber’d here\n   While these visions did appear.\n   And this weak and idle theme,\n   No more yielding but a dream,\n   Gentles, do not reprehend.\n   If you pardon, we will mend.\n   And, as I am an honest Puck,\n   If we have unearnèd luck\n   Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,\n   We will make amends ere long;\n   Else the Puck a liar call.\n   So, good night unto you all.\n   Give me your hands, if we be friends,\n   And Robin shall restore amends.\n\n[Exit.]",
