    "content":"ACT I\nSCENE I. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.\nEnter Bertram, the Countess of Rossillon, Helena, and Lafew, all in black.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.\n\nLAFEW.\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such abundance.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?\n\nLAFEW.\nHe hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis young gentlewoman had a father—O that “had!”, how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would for the king’s sake he were living! I think it would be the death of the king’s disease.\n\nLAFEW.\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv’d still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\n\nLAFEW.\nA fistula, my lord.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI heard not of it before.\n\nLAFEW.\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\n\nCOUNTESS.\n’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.\n\nHELENA.\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\n\nLAFEW.\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the enemy to the living.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\n\nLAFEW.\nHow understand we that?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\nIn manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\nDo wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy\nRather in power than use; and keep thy friend\nUnder thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence,\nBut never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,\nThat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\nFall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,\n’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,\nAdvise him.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe cannot want the best\nThat shall attend his love.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\n\n[Exit Countess.]\n\nBERTRAM.\nThe best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you! [To Helena.] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.\n\nLAFEW.\nFarewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.\n\n[Exeunt Bertram and Lafew.]\n\nHELENA.\nO, were that all! I think not on my father,\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\nI have forgot him; my imagination\nCarries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\nIf Bertram be away. ’Twere all one\nThat I should love a bright particular star,\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me.\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\nTh’ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\nMust die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\nIn our heart’s table,—heart too capable\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour.\nBut now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy\nMust sanctify his relics. Who comes here?\nEnter Parolles.\n\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake,\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\nYet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him\nThat they take place when virtue’s steely bones\nLooks bleak i’ th’ cold wind: withal, full oft we see\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\n\nPAROLLES.\nSave you, fair queen!\n\nHELENA.\nAnd you, monarch!\n\nPAROLLES.\nNo.\n\nHELENA.\nAnd no.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAre you meditating on virginity?\n\nHELENA.\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?\n\nPAROLLES.\nKeep him out.\n\nHELENA.\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up.\n\nHELENA.\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?\n\nPAROLLES.\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion. Away with it!\n\nHELENA.\nI will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThere’s little can be said in’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with it!\n\nHELENA.\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\n\nPAROLLES.\nLet me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither’d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a wither’d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear. Will you anything with it?\n\nHELENA.\nNot my virginity yet.\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\nA mother, and a mistress, and a friend,\nA phoenix, captain, and an enemy,\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear:\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\nThe court’s a learning-place; and he is one.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat one, i’ faith?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I wish well. ’Tis pity—\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat’s pity?\n\nHELENA.\nThat wishing well had not a body in’t\nWhich might be felt, that we, the poorer born,\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\nAnd show what we alone must think, which never\nReturns us thanks.\n\nEnter a Page.\n\nPAGE.\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\n\n[Exit Page.]\n\nPAROLLES.\nLittle Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.\n\nHELENA.\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\n\nPAROLLES.\nUnder Mars, I.\n\nHELENA.\nI especially think, under Mars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy under Mars?\n\nHELENA.\nThe wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under Mars.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhen he was predominant.\n\nHELENA.\nWhen he was retrograde, I think rather.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy think you so?\n\nHELENA.\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat’s for advantage.\n\nHELENA.\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nHELENA.\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\nGives us free scope; only doth backward pull\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\nTo join like likes, and kiss like native things.\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\nThat weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose\nWhat hath been cannot be. Who ever strove\nTo show her merit that did miss her love?\nThe king’s disease,—my project may deceive me,\nBut my intents are fix’d, and will not leave me.\n\n[Exit.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.\nFlourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and others attending.\n\nKING.\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears;\nHave fought with equal fortune, and continue\nA braving war.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nSo ’tis reported, sir.\n\nKING.\nNay, ’tis most credible, we here receive it,\nA certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria,\nWith caution, that the Florentine will move us\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\nPrejudicates the business, and would seem\nTo have us make denial.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHis love and wisdom,\nApprov’d so to your majesty, may plead\nFor amplest credence.\n\nKING.\nHe hath arm’d our answer,\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\nTo stand on either part.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIt well may serve\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\nFor breathing and exploit.\n\nKING.\nWhat’s he comes here?\n\nEnter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIt is the Count Rossillon, my good lord,\nYoung Bertram.\n\nKING.\nYouth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\nHath well compos’d thee. Thy father’s moral parts\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty’s.\n\nKING.\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\nFirst tried our soldiership. He did look far\nInto the service of the time, and was\nDiscipled of the bravest. He lasted long,\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on,\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\nTo talk of your good father; in his youth\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\nToday in our young lords; but they may jest\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\nEre they can hide their levity in honour\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\nHis equal had awak’d them, and his honour,\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\nException bid him speak, and at this time\nHis tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him\nHe us’d as creatures of another place,\nAnd bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,\nMaking them proud of his humility,\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\nWhich, followed well, would demonstrate them now\nBut goers backward.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHis good remembrance, sir,\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\nAs in your royal speech.\n\nKING.\nWould I were with him! He would always say,—\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\nHe scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them\nTo grow there and to bear,—“Let me not live,”\nThis his good melancholy oft began\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\nWhen it was out,—“Let me not live” quoth he,\n“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\nExpire before their fashions.” This he wish’d.\nI, after him, do after him wish too,\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive\nTo give some labourers room.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou’re lov’d, sir;\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\n\nKING.\nI fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count,\nSince the physician at your father’s died?\nHe was much fam’d.\n\nBERTRAM.\nSome six months since, my lord.\n\nKING.\nIf he were living, I would try him yet;—\nLend me an arm;—the rest have worn me out\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;\nMy son’s no dearer.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThank your majesty.\n\n[Exeunt. Flourish.]",

    "content":"SCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.\nEnter Countess, Steward and Clown.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; ’tis my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.\n\nCLOWN.\n’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, sir.\n\nCLOWN.\nNo, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned; but if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\n\nCLOWN.\nI do beg your good will in this case.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIn what case?\n\nCLOWN.\nIn Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for they say barnes are blessings.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\n\nCLOWN.\nMy poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil drives.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIs this all your worship’s reason?\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nMay the world know them?\n\nCLOWN.\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife’s sake.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\n\nCLOWN.\nY’are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist, howsome’er their hearts are sever’d in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ the herd.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouth’d and calumnious knave?\n\nCLOWN.\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:\n   For I the ballad will repeat,\n   Which men full true shall find;\n   Your marriage comes by destiny,\n   Your cuckoo sings by kind.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGet you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to speak.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.\n\nCLOWN.\n[Sings.]\n   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\n     Why the Grecians sacked Troy?\n   Fond done, done fond,\n      Was this King Priam’s joy?\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\n      And gave this sentence then:\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\n     There’s yet one good in ten.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhat, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.\n\nCLOWN.\nOne good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o’ the song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth ’a! And we might have a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake, ’twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he pluck one.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!\n\nCLOWN.\nThat man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWell, now.\n\nSTEWARD.\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nFaith I do. Her father bequeath’d her to me, and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds; there is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than she’ll demand.\n\nSTEWARD.\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish’d me; alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touch’d not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris’d, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she deliver’d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou have discharg’d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many likelihoods inform’d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me; stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon.\n\n[Exit Steward.]\n\nEnter Helena.\n\nEven so it was with me when I was young;\nIf ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn\nDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\nOur blood to us, this to our blood is born;\nIt is the show and seal of nature’s truth,\nWhere love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth.\nBy our remembrances of days foregone,\nSuch were our faults, or then we thought them none.\nHer eye is sick on’t; I observe her now.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat is your pleasure, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou know, Helen,\nI am a mother to you.\n\nHELENA.\nMine honourable mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNay, a mother.\nWhy not a mother? When I said a mother,\nMethought you saw a serpent. What’s in mother,\nThat you start at it? I say I am your mother,\nAnd put you in the catalogue of those\nThat were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen\nAdoption strives with nature, and choice breeds\nA native slip to us from foreign seeds.\nYou ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan,\nYet I express to you a mother’s care.\nGod’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\nTo say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,\nThat this distempered messenger of wet,\nThe many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye?\n—Why, that you are my daughter?\n\nHELENA.\nThat I am not.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI say, I am your mother.\n\nHELENA.\nPardon, madam;\nThe Count Rossillon cannot be my brother.\nI am from humble, he from honoured name;\nNo note upon my parents, his all noble,\nMy master, my dear lord he is; and I\nHis servant live, and will his vassal die.\nHe must not be my brother.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNor I your mother?\n\nHELENA.\nYou are my mother, madam; would you were—\nSo that my lord your son were not my brother,—\nIndeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,\nI care no more for than I do for heaven,\nSo I were not his sister. Can’t no other,\nBut, I your daughter, he must be my brother?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.\nGod shield you mean it not! daughter and mother\nSo strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?\nMy fear hath catch’d your fondness; now I see\nThe mystery of your loneliness, and find\nYour salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross\nYou love my son; invention is asham’d,\nAgainst the proclamation of thy passion\nTo say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;\nBut tell me then, ’tis so; for, look, thy cheeks\nConfess it, t’one to th’other; and thine eyes\nSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviours,\nThat in their kind they speak it; only sin\nAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\nThat truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?\nIf it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;\nIf it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee,\nAs heaven shall work in me for thine avail,\nTo tell me truly.\n\nHELENA.\nGood madam, pardon me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDo you love my son?\n\nHELENA.\nYour pardon, noble mistress.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nLove you my son?\n\nHELENA.\nDo not you love him, madam?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nGo not about; my love hath in’t a bond\nWhereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose\nThe state of your affection, for your passions\nHave to the full appeach’d.\n\nHELENA.\nThen I confess,\nHere on my knee, before high heaven and you,\nThat before you, and next unto high heaven,\nI love your son.\nMy friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love.\nBe not offended; for it hurts not him\nThat he is lov’d of me; I follow him not\nBy any token of presumptuous suit,\nNor would I have him till I do deserve him;\nYet never know how that desert should be.\nI know I love in vain, strive against hope;\nYet in this captious and inteemable sieve\nI still pour in the waters of my love\nAnd lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,\nReligious in mine error, I adore\nThe sun that looks upon his worshipper,\nBut knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\nLet not your hate encounter with my love,\nFor loving where you do; but if yourself,\nWhose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\nDid ever, in so true a flame of liking,\nWish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian\nWas both herself and love; O then, give pity\nTo her whose state is such that cannot choose\nBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;\nThat seeks not to find that her search implies,\nBut riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHad you not lately an intent,—speak truly,—\nTo go to Paris?\n\nHELENA.\nMadam, I had.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWherefore? tell true.\n\nHELENA.\nI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\nYou know my father left me some prescriptions\nOf rare and prov’d effects, such as his reading\nAnd manifest experience had collected\nFor general sovereignty; and that he will’d me\nIn heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,\nAs notes whose faculties inclusive were\nMore than they were in note. Amongst the rest\nThere is a remedy, approv’d, set down,\nTo cure the desperate languishings whereof\nThe king is render’d lost.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nThis was your motive\nFor Paris, was it? Speak.\n\nHELENA.\nMy lord your son made me to think of this;\nElse Paris, and the medicine, and the king,\nHad from the conversation of my thoughts\nHaply been absent then.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nBut think you, Helen,\nIf you should tender your supposed aid,\nHe would receive it? He and his physicians\nAre of a mind; he, that they cannot help him;\nThey, that they cannot help. How shall they credit\nA poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,\nEmbowell’d of their doctrine, have let off\nThe danger to itself?\n\nHELENA.\nThere’s something in’t\nMore than my father’s skill, which was the great’st\nOf his profession, that his good receipt\nShall for my legacy be sanctified\nBy th’ luckiest stars in heaven; and would your honour\nBut give me leave to try success, I’d venture\nThe well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure.\nBy such a day, an hour.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDost thou believe’t?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, madam, knowingly.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhy, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,\nMeans and attendants, and my loving greetings\nTo those of mine in court. I’ll stay at home,\nAnd pray God’s blessing into thy attempt.\nBe gone tomorrow; and be sure of this,\nWhat I can help thee to, thou shalt not miss.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"ACT II\nSCENE I. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.\nFlourish. Enter the King with young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; Bertram, Parolles and Attendants.\n\nKING.\nFarewell, young lords; these warlike principles\nDo not throw from you; and you, my lords, farewell;\nShare the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,\nThe gift doth stretch itself as ’tis receiv’d,\nAnd is enough for both.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n’Tis our hope, sir,\nAfter well-ent’red soldiers, to return\nAnd find your grace in health.\n\nKING.\nNo, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart\nWill not confess he owes the malady\nThat doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords.\nWhether I live or die, be you the sons\nOf worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,—\nThose bated that inherit but the fall\nOf the last monarchy—see that you come\nNot to woo honour, but to wed it, when\nThe bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek,\nThat fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHealth, at your bidding serve your majesty!\n\nKING.\nThose girls of Italy, take heed of them;\nThey say our French lack language to deny\nIf they demand; beware of being captives\nBefore you serve.\n\nBOTH.\nOur hearts receive your warnings.\n\nKING.\nFarewell.—Come hither to me.\n\n[The King retires to a couch.]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!\n\nPAROLLES.\n’Tis not his fault; the spark.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nO, ’tis brave wars!\n\nPAROLLES.\nMost admirable! I have seen those wars.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI am commanded here, and kept a coil with,\n“Too young”, and “the next year” and “’tis too early”.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAn thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,\nCreaking my shoes on the plain masonry,\nTill honour be bought up, and no sword worn\nBut one to dance with. By heaven, I’ll steal away.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThere’s honour in the theft.\n\nPAROLLES.\nCommit it, count.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI am your accessary; and so farewell.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI grow to you, and our parting is a tortur’d body.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nFarewell, captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nSweet Monsieur Parolles!\n\nPAROLLES.\nNoble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench’d it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nWe shall, noble captain.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMars dote on you for his novices!\n\n[Exeunt Lords.]\n\nWhat will ye do?\n\nBERTRAM.\nStay the king.\n\nPAROLLES.\nUse a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain’d yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the influence of the most receiv’d star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd I will do so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWorthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.\n\n[Exeunt Bertram and Parolles.]\n\nEnter Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nPardon, my lord [kneeling], for me and for my tidings.\n\nKING.\nI’ll fee thee to stand up.\n\nLAFEW.\nThen here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon.\nI would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy,\nAnd that at my bidding you could so stand up.\n\nKING.\nI would I had; so I had broke thy pate,\nAnd ask’d thee mercy for’t.\n\nLAFEW.\nGood faith, across;\nBut, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cur’d\nOf your infirmity?\n\nKING.\nNo.\n\nLAFEW.\nO, will you eat\nNo grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will\nMy noble grapes, and if my royal fox\nCould reach them. I have seen a medicine\nThat’s able to breathe life into a stone,\nQuicken a rock, and make you dance canary\nWith sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch\nIs powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,\nTo give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand\nAnd write to her a love-line.\n\nKING.\nWhat ‘her’ is this?\n\nLAFEW.\nWhy, doctor ‘she’! My lord, there’s one arriv’d,\nIf you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,\nIf seriously I may convey my thoughts\nIn this my light deliverance, I have spoke\nWith one that in her sex, her years, profession,\nWisdom, and constancy, hath amaz’d me more\nThan I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,\nFor that is her demand, and know her business?\nThat done, laugh well at me.\n\nKING.\nNow, good Lafew,\nBring in the admiration; that we with thee\nMay spend our wonder too, or take off thine\nBy wond’ring how thou took’st it.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, I’ll fit you,\nAnd not be all day neither.\n\n[Exit Lafew.]\n\nKING.\nThus he his special nothing ever prologues.\n\nEnter Lafew with Helena.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, come your ways.\n\nKING.\nThis haste hath wings indeed.\n\nLAFEW.\nNay, come your ways.\nThis is his majesty, say your mind to him.\nA traitor you do look like, but such traitors\nHis majesty seldom fears; I am Cressid’s uncle,\nThat dare leave two together. Fare you well.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nKING.\nNow, fair one, does your business follow us?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, my good lord.\nGerard de Narbon was my father,\nIn what he did profess, well found.\n\nKING.\nI knew him.\n\nHELENA.\nThe rather will I spare my praises towards him.\nKnowing him is enough. On his bed of death\nMany receipts he gave me; chiefly one,\nWhich, as the dearest issue of his practice,\nAnd of his old experience the only darling,\nHe bade me store up as a triple eye,\nSafer than mine own two; more dear I have so,\nAnd hearing your high majesty is touch’d\nWith that malignant cause, wherein the honour\nOf my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,\nI come to tender it, and my appliance,\nWith all bound humbleness.\n\nKING.\nWe thank you, maiden,\nBut may not be so credulous of cure,\nWhen our most learned doctors leave us, and\nThe congregated college have concluded\nThat labouring art can never ransom nature\nFrom her inaidable estate. I say we must not\nSo stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,\nTo prostitute our past-cure malady\nTo empirics, or to dissever so\nOur great self and our credit, to esteem\nA senseless help, when help past sense we deem.\n\nHELENA.\nMy duty then shall pay me for my pains.\nI will no more enforce mine office on you,\nHumbly entreating from your royal thoughts\nA modest one to bear me back again.\n\nKING.\nI cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful.\nThou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give\nAs one near death to those that wish him live.\nBut what at full I know, thou know’st no part;\nI knowing all my peril, thou no art.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat I can do can do no hurt to try,\nSince you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.\nHe that of greatest works is finisher\nOft does them by the weakest minister.\nSo holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,\nWhen judges have been babes. Great floods have flown\nFrom simple sources, and great seas have dried\nWhen miracles have by the great’st been denied.\nOft expectation fails, and most oft there\nWhere most it promises; and oft it hits\nWhere hope is coldest, and despair most fits.\n\nKING.\nI must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.\nThy pains, not us’d, must by thyself be paid;\nProffers, not took, reap thanks for their reward.\n\nHELENA.\nInspired merit so by breath is barr’d.\nIt is not so with Him that all things knows\nAs ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;\nBut most it is presumption in us when\nThe help of heaven we count the act of men.\nDear sir, to my endeavours give consent;\nOf heaven, not me, make an experiment.\nI am not an impostor, that proclaim\nMyself against the level of mine aim,\nBut know I think, and think I know most sure,\nMy art is not past power nor you past cure.\n\nKING.\nArt thou so confident? Within what space\nHop’st thou my cure?\n\nHELENA.\nThe greatest grace lending grace.\nEre twice the horses of the sun shall bring\nTheir fiery torcher his diurnal ring,\nEre twice in murk and occidental damp\nMoist Hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy lamp;\nOr four and twenty times the pilot’s glass\nHath told the thievish minutes how they pass;\nWhat is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,\nHealth shall live free, and sickness freely die.\n\nKING.\nUpon thy certainty and confidence\nWhat dar’st thou venture?\n\nHELENA.\nTax of impudence,\nA strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame,\nTraduc’d by odious ballads; my maiden’s name\nSear’d otherwise; nay worse of worst extended\nWith vilest torture, let my life be ended.\n\nKING.\nMethinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak\nHis powerful sound within an organ weak;\nAnd what impossibility would slay\nIn common sense, sense saves another way.\nThy life is dear, for all that life can rate\nWorth name of life in thee hath estimate:\nYouth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all\nThat happiness and prime can happy call.\nThou this to hazard needs must intimate\nSkill infinite, or monstrous desperate.\nSweet practiser, thy physic I will try,\nThat ministers thine own death if I die.\n\nHELENA.\nIf I break time, or flinch in property\nOf what I spoke, unpitied let me die,\nAnd well deserv’d. Not helping, death’s my fee;\nBut if I help, what do you promise me?\n\nKING.\nMake thy demand.\n\nHELENA.\nBut will you make it even?\n\nKING.\nAy, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.\n\nHELENA.\nThen shalt thou give me, with thy kingly hand\nWhat husband in thy power I will command:\nExempted be from me the arrogance\nTo choose from forth the royal blood of France,\nMy low and humble name to propagate\nWith any branch or image of thy state;\nBut such a one, thy vassal, whom I know\nIs free for me to ask, thee to bestow.\n\nKING.\nHere is my hand; the premises observ’d,\nThy will by my performance shall be serv’d;\nSo make the choice of thy own time, for I,\nThy resolv’d patient, on thee still rely.\nMore should I question thee, and more I must,\nThough more to know could not be more to trust:\nFrom whence thou cam’st, how tended on; but rest\nUnquestion’d welcome, and undoubted bless’d.\nGive me some help here, ho! If thou proceed\nAs high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.\n\n[Flourish. Exeunt.]",

A room in the Countess’s palace.\nEnter Countess and Clown.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nCome on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.\n\nCLOWN.\nI will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTo the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!\n\nCLOWN.\nTruly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nMarry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.\n\nCLOWN.\nIt is like a barber’s chair, that fits all buttocks—the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWill your answer serve fit to all questions?\n\nCLOWN.\nAs fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHave you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?\n\nCLOWN.\nFrom below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIt must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.\n\nCLOWN.\nBut a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nTo be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Thick, thick; spare not me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nYou were lately whipp’d, sir, as I think.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Spare not me.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nDo you cry ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and ‘spare not me’? Indeed your ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.\n\nCLOWN.\nI ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord, sir!’ I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI play the noble housewife with the time, to entertain it so merrily with a fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nO Lord, sir! Why, there’t serves well again.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nAn end, sir! To your business.

The King’s palace.\nEnter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\n\nLAFEW.\nThey say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAnd so ’tis.\n\nLAFEW.\nTo be relinquish’d of the artists,—\n\nPAROLLES.\nSo I say; both of Galen and Paracelsus.\n\nLAFEW.\nOf all the learned and authentic fellows,—\n\nPAROLLES.\nRight; so I say.\n\nLAFEW.\nThat gave him out incurable,—\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, there ’tis; so say I too.\n\nLAFEW.\nNot to be helped.\n\nPAROLLES.\nRight; as ’twere a man assur’d of a—\n\nLAFEW.\nUncertain life and sure death.\n\nPAROLLES.\nJust; you say well.

Here comes the king.\n\nEnter King, Helena and Attendants.\n\nLAFEW.\nLustique, as the Dutchman says. I’ll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he’s able to lead her a coranto.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMor du vinager! is not this Helen?\n\nLAFEW.\nFore God, I think so.\n\nKING.\nGo, call before me all the lords in court.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nSit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side,\nAnd with this healthful hand, whose banish’d sense\nThou has repeal’d, a second time receive\nThe confirmation of my promis’d gift,\nWhich but attends thy naming.\n\nEnter several Lords.\n\nFair maid, send forth thine eye.

Thy frank election make;\nThou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.\n\nHELENA.\nTo each of you one fair and virtuous mistress\nFall, when love please! Marry, to each but one!\n\nLAFEW.\nI’d give bay curtal and his furniture\nMy mouth no more were broken than these boys’,\nAnd writ as little beard.\n\nKING.\nPeruse them well.\nNot one of those but had a noble father.\n\nShe addresses her to a Lord.\n\nHELENA.\nGentlemen,\nHeaven hath through me restor’d the king to health.\n\nALL.\nWe understand it, and thank heaven for you.\n\nHELENA.\nI am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest\nThat I protest I simply am a maid.\nPlease it, your majesty, I have done already.\nThe blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:\n“We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,\nLet the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,\nWe’ll ne’er come there again.”\n\nKING.\nMake choice; and, see,\nWho shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.\n\nHELENA.\nNow, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,\nAnd to imperial Love, that god most high,\nDo my sighs stream. [To first Lord.] Sir, will you hear my suit?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAnd grant it.\n\nHELENA.\nThanks, sir; all the rest is mute.\n\nLAFEW.\nI had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.\n\nHELENA.\n[To second Lord.] The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,\nBefore I speak, too threat’ningly replies.\nLove make your fortunes twenty times above\nHer that so wishes, and her humble love!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNo better, if you please.\n\nHELENA.\nMy wish receive,\nWhich great Love grant; and so I take my leave.\n\nLAFEW.\nDo all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I’d have them whipp’d; or I would send them to th’ Turk to make eunuchs of.\n\nHELENA.\n[To third Lord.] Be not afraid that I your hand should take;\nI’ll never do you wrong for your own sake.\nBlessing upon your vows, and in your bed\nFind fairer fortune, if you ever wed!\n\nLAFEW.\nThese boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her. Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne’er got ’em.\n\nHELENA.\n[To fourth Lord.] You are too young, too happy, and too good,\nTo make yourself a son out of my blood.\n\nFOURTH LORD.\nFair one, I think not so.\n\nLAFEW.\nThere’s one grape yet. I am sure thy father drank wine. But if thou beest not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.\n\nHELENA.\n[To Bertram.] I dare not say I take you, but I give\nMe and my service, ever whilst I live,\nInto your guiding power. This is the man.\n\nKING.\nWhy, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,\nIn such a business give me leave to use\nThe help of mine own eyes.\n\nKING.\nKnow’st thou not, Bertram,\nWhat she has done for me?\n\nBERTRAM.\nYes, my good lord,\nBut never hope to know why I should marry her.\n\nKING.\nThou know’st she has rais’d me from my sickly bed.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut follows it, my lord, to bring me down\nMust answer for your raising? I know her well;\nShe had her breeding at my father’s charge:\nA poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain\nRather corrupt me ever!\n\nKING.\n’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which\nI can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\nOf colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together,\nWould quite confound distinction, yet stands off\nIn differences so mighty. If she be\nAll that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st,\nA poor physician’s daughter,—thou dislik’st—\nOf virtue for the name. But do not so.\nFrom lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\nThe place is dignified by the doer’s deed.\nWhere great additions swell’s, and virtue none,\nIt is a dropsied honour. Good alone\nIs good without a name; vileness is so:\nThe property by what it is should go,\nNot by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\nIn these to nature she’s immediate heir;\nAnd these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn\nWhich challenges itself as honour’s born,\nAnd is not like the sire. Honours thrive\nWhen rather from our acts we them derive\nThan our fore-goers. The mere word’s a slave,\nDebauch’d on every tomb, on every grave\nA lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\nWhere dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb\nOf honour’d bones indeed. What should be said?\nIf thou canst like this creature as a maid,\nI can create the rest. Virtue and she\nIs her own dower; honour and wealth from me.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI cannot love her, nor will strive to do ’t.\n\nKING.\nThou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.\n\nHELENA.\nThat you are well restor’d, my lord, I am glad.\nLet the rest go.\n\nKING.\nMy honour’s at the stake, which to defeat,\nI must produce my power. Here, take her hand,\nProud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,\nThat dost in vile misprision shackle up\nMy love and her desert; that canst not dream\nWe, poising us in her defective scale,\nShall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know\nIt is in us to plant thine honour where\nWe please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;\nObey our will, which travails in thy good;\nBelieve not thy disdain, but presently\nDo thine own fortunes that obedient right\nWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;\nOr I will throw thee from my care for ever\nInto the staggers and the careless lapse\nOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\nLoosing upon thee in the name of justice,\nWithout all terms of pity. Speak! Thine answer!\n\nBERTRAM.\nPardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\nMy fancy to your eyes. When I consider\nWhat great creation, and what dole of honour\nFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\nWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\nThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\nIs as ’twere born so.\n\nKING.\nTake her by the hand,\nAnd tell her she is thine; to whom I promise\nA counterpoise; if not to thy estate,\nA balance more replete.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI take her hand.\n\nKING.\nGood fortune and the favour of the king\nSmile upon this contract; whose ceremony\nShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\nAnd be perform’d tonight. The solemn feast\nShall more attend upon the coming space,\nExpecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her,\nThy love’s to me religious; else, does err.\n\n[Exeunt King, Bertram, Helena, Lords, and Attendants.]\n\nLAFEW.\nDo you hear, monsieur? A word with you.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYour pleasure, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour lord and master did well to make his recantation.\n\nPAROLLES.\nRecantation! My lord! My master!\n\nLAFEW.\nAy. Is it not a language I speak?\n\nPAROLLES.\nA most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master!\n\nLAFEW.\nAre you companion to the Count Rossillon?\n\nPAROLLES.\nTo any count; to all counts; to what is man.\n\nLAFEW.\nTo what is count’s man: count’s master is of another style.\n\nPAROLLES.\nYou are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.\n\nLAFEW.\nI must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat I dare too well do, I dare not do.\n\nLAFEW.\nI did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and that thou art scarce worth.\n\nPAROLLES.\nHadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee—\n\nLAFEW.\nDo not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if—Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, you give me most egregious indignity.\n\nLAFEW.\nAy, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI have not, my lord, deserv’d it.\n\nLAFEW.\nYes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWell, I shall be wiser.\n\nLAFEW.\nEv’n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ th’ contrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, “He is a man I know.”\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.\n\nLAFEW.\nI would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPAROLLES.\nWell, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I’ll have no more pity of his age than I would have of—I’ll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.\n\nEnter Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nSirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news for you; you have a new mistress.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.\n\nLAFEW.\nWho? God?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, sir.\n\nLAFEW.\nThe devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’ this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methink’st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThis is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.\n\nLAFEW.\nGo to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller. You are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word, else I’d call you knave. I leave you.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nEnter Bertram.\n\nPAROLLES.\nGood, very good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal’d awhile.\n\nBERTRAM.\nUndone, and forfeited to cares for ever!\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat’s the matter, sweetheart?\n\nBERTRAM.\nAlthough before the solemn priest I have sworn,\nI will not bed her.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat, what, sweetheart?\n\nBERTRAM.\nO my Parolles, they have married me!\nI’ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.\n\nPAROLLES.\nFrance is a dog-hole, and it no more merits\nThe tread of a man’s foot: to the wars!\n\nBERTRAM.\nThere’s letters from my mother; what th’ import is\nI know not yet.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, that would be known. To th’ wars, my boy, to th’ wars!\nHe wears his honour in a box unseen\nThat hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,\nSpending his manly marrow in her arms,\nWhich should sustain the bound and high curvet\nOf Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions!\nFrance is a stable; we that dwell in’t, jades,\nTherefore, to th’ war!\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt shall be so; I’ll send her to my house,\nAcquaint my mother with my hate to her,\nAnd wherefore I am fled; write to the king\nThat which I durst not speak. His present gift\nShall furnish me to those Italian fields\nWhere noble fellows strike. War is no strife\nTo the dark house and the detested wife.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWill this caprichio hold in thee, art sure?\n\nBERTRAM.\nGo with me to my chamber and advise me.\nI’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow\nI’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhy, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ’Tis hard:\nA young man married is a man that’s marr’d.\nTherefore away, and leave her bravely; go.\nThe king has done you wrong; but hush ’tis so.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Poor lord, is’t I\nThat chase thee from thy country, and expose\nThose tender limbs of thine to the event\nOf the none-sparing war? And is it I\nThat drive thee from the sportive court, where thou\nWast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark\nOf smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to’t;\nAnd though I kill him not, I am the cause\nHis death was so effected. Better ’twere\nI met the ravin lion when he roar’d\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better ’twere\nThat all the miseries which nature owes\nWere mine at once. No; come thou home, Rossillon,\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,\nAs oft it loses all. I will be gone;\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence.\nShall I stay here to do’t? No, no, although\nThe air of paradise did fan the house,\nAnd angels offic’d all. I will be gone,\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I’ll steal away.\n\n[Exit.]",

Without the walls of Florence.\nEnter an old Widow of Florence, Diana, Violenta, Mariana and other Citizens.\n\nWIDOW.\nNay, come; for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the sight.\n\nDIANA.\nThey say the French count has done most honourable service.\n\nWIDOW.\nIt is reported that he has taken their great’st commander, and that with his own hand he slew the duke’s brother.\n\n[A tucket afar off.]\n\nWe have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you may know by their trumpets.\n\nMARIANA.\nCome, let’s return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the honour of a maid is her name; and no legacy is so rich as honesty.\n\nWIDOW.\nI have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.\n\nMARIANA.\nI know that knave; hang him! one Parolles; a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.\n\nDIANA.\nYou shall not need to fear me.\n\nEnter Helena in the dress of a pilgrim.\n\nWIDOW.\nI hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie at my house; thither they send one another; I’ll question her. God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?\n\nHELENA.\nTo Saint Jaques le Grand.\nWhere do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?\n\nWIDOW.\nAt the Saint Francis here, beside the port.\n\nHELENA.\nIs this the way?\n\n[A march afar.]\n\nWIDOW.\nAy, marry, is’t. Hark you, they come this way.\nIf you will tarry, holy pilgrim,\nBut till the troops come by,\nI will conduct you where you shall be lodg’d;\nThe rather for I think I know your hostess\nAs ample as myself.\n\nHELENA.\nIs it yourself?\n\nWIDOW.\nIf you shall please so, pilgrim.\n\nHELENA.\nI thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.\n\nWIDOW.\nYou came, I think, from France?\n\nHELENA.\nI did so.\n\nWIDOW.\nHere you shall see a countryman of yours\nThat has done worthy service.\n\nHELENA.\nHis name, I pray you.\n\nDIANA.\nThe Count Rossillon. Know you such a one?\n\nHELENA.\nBut by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;\nHis face I know not.\n\nDIANA.\nWhatsome’er he is,\nHe’s bravely taken here. He stole from France,\nAs ’tis reported, for the king had married him\nAgainst his liking. Think you it is so?\n\nHELENA.\nAy, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.\n\nDIANA.\nThere is a gentleman that serves the count\nReports but coarsely of her.\n\nHELENA.\nWhat’s his name?\n\nDIANA.\nMonsieur Parolles.\n\nHELENA.\nO, I believe with him,\nIn argument of praise, or to the worth\nOf the great count himself, she is too mean\nTo have her name repeated; all her deserving\nIs a reserved honesty, and that\nI have not heard examin’d.\n\nDIANA.\nAlas, poor lady!\n’Tis a hard bondage to become the wife\nOf a detesting lord.\n\nWIDOW.\nAy, right; good creature, wheresoe’er she is,\nHer heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her\nA shrewd turn, if she pleas’d.\n\nHELENA.\nHow do you mean?\nMaybe the amorous count solicits her\nIn the unlawful purpose.\n\nWIDOW.\nHe does indeed,\nAnd brokes with all that can in such a suit\nCorrupt the tender honour of a maid;\nBut she is arm’d for him, and keeps her guard\nIn honestest defence.\n\nEnter, with a drum and colours, a party of the Florentine army, Bertram and Parolles.\n\nMARIANA.\nThe gods forbid else!\n\nWIDOW.\nSo, now they come.\nThat is Antonio, the Duke’s eldest son;\nThat Escalus.\n\nHELENA.\nWhich is the Frenchman?\n\nDIANA.\nHe;\nThat with the plume; ’tis a most gallant fellow.\nI would he lov’d his wife; if he were honester\nHe were much goodlier. Is’t not a handsome gentleman?\n\nHELENA.\nI like him well.\n\nDIANA.\n’Tis pity he is not honest. Yond’s that same knave\nThat leads him to these places. Were I his lady\nI would poison that vile rascal.\n\nHELENA.\nWhich is he?\n\nDIANA.\nThat jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?\n\nHELENA.\nPerchance he’s hurt i’ the battle.\n\nPAROLLES.\nLose our drum! Well.\n\nMARIANA.\nHe’s shrewdly vex’d at something. Look, he has spied us.\n\nWIDOW.\nMarry, hang you!\n\nMARIANA.\nAnd your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!\n\n[Exeunt Bertram, Parolles, Officers and Soldiers.]\n\nWIDOW.\nThe troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you\nWhere you shall host; of enjoin’d penitents\nThere’s four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,\nAlready at my house.\n\nHELENA.\nI humbly thank you.\nPlease it this matron and this gentle maid\nTo eat with us tonight; the charge and thanking\nShall be for me; and, to requite you further,\nI will bestow some precepts of this virgin,\nWorthy the note.\n\nBOTH.\nWe’ll take your offer kindly.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

    "content":"SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.\nEnter Bertram and the two French Lords.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNay, good my lord, put him to’t; let him have his way.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIf your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nOn my life, my lord, a bubble.\n\nBERTRAM.\nDo you think I am so far deceived in him?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBelieve it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he’s a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIt were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business, in a main danger fail you.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI would I knew in what particular action to try him.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nNone better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy; we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination; if he do not for the promise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nO, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for’t. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in’t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum’s entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.\n\nEnter Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nO, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHow now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nA pox on ’t; let it go; ’tis but a drum.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBut a drum! Is’t but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent command, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThat was not to be blam’d in the command of the service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt might have been recovered.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIt might, but it is not now.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIt is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or hic jacet.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhy, if you have a stomach, to’t, monsieur, if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit; if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.\n\nPAROLLES.\nBy the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut you must not now slumber in it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI’ll about it this evening; and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI know th’art valiant; and to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI love not many words.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNo more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damn’d than to do’t.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nYou do not know him, my lord, as we do; certain it is that he will steal himself into a man’s favour, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhy, do you think he will make no deed at all of this, that so seriously he does address himself unto?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNone in the world; but return with an invention, and clap upon you two or three probable lies; but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your lordship’s respect.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWe’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smok’d by the old Lord Lafew; when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI must go look my twigs. He shall be caught.\n\nBERTRAM.\nYour brother, he shall go along with me.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAs’t please your lordship. I’ll leave you.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBERTRAM.\nNow will I lead you to the house, and show you\nThe lass I spoke of.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nBut you say she’s honest.\n\nBERTRAM.\nThat’s all the fault. I spoke with her but once,\nAnd found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her\nBy this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind\nTokens and letters which she did re-send,\nAnd this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature;\nWill you go see her?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWith all my heart, my lord.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! Here he comes; to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.\n\nEnter Parolles.\n\nPAROLLES.\nTen o’clock. Within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knock’d too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was guilty of.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWhat the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit; yet slight ones will not carry it. They will say “Came you off with so little?” and great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what’s the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman’s mouth, and buy myself another of Bajazet’s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] We cannot afford you so.\n\nPAROLLES.\nOr the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] ’Twould not do.\n\nPAROLLES.\nOr to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] Hardly serve.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThough I swore I leap’d from the window of the citadel,—\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] How deep?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThirty fathom.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI would I had any drum of the enemy’s; I would swear I recover’d it.\n\nFIRST LORD.\n[Aside.] You shall hear one anon.\n\nPAROLLES.\nA drum now of the enemy’s!\n\n[Alarum within.]\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThroca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.\n\nALL.\nCargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.\n\n[They seize and blindfold him.]\n\nPAROLLES.\nO, ransom, ransom!

And as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr’d ends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o’erflows himself.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nIs it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents?

Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirm’d by the rector of the place.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHath the count all this intelligence?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nAy, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!\n\nSECOND LORD.\nAnd how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir’d for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish’d by our virtues.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nHow now? Where’s your master?\n\nMESSENGER.\nHe met the duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThey shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.\n\nEnter Bertram.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nThey cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness. Here’s his lordship now. How now, my lord, is’t not after midnight?\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have tonight despatch’d sixteen businesses, a month’s length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn’d for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main parcels of despatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nIf the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv’d me like a double-meaning prophesier.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nBring him forth.\n\n[Exeunt Soldiers.]\n\nHas sat i’ the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.\n\nBERTRAM.\nNo matter; his heels have deserv’d it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI have told your lordship already; the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i’ the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed?\n\nBERTRAM.\nNothing of me, has he?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your lordship be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it.\n\nEnter Soldiers with Parolles.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush, hush!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHoodman comes! Portotartarossa.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHe calls for the tortures. What will you say without ’em?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI will confess what I know without constraint. If ye pinch me like a pasty I can say no more.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nBosko chimurcho.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nBoblibindo chicurmurco.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nYou are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.\n\nPAROLLES.\nAnd truly, as I hope to live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n‘First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.’ What say you to that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFive or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nShall I set down your answer so?\n\nPAROLLES.\nDo. I’ll take the sacrament on ’t, how and which way you will.\n\nBERTRAM.\nAll’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\n\nFIRST LORD.\nYou are deceived, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist (that was his own phrase), that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean, nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that’s set down.\n\nPAROLLES.\n‘Five or six thousand horse’ I said—I will say true—or thereabouts, set down,—for I’ll speak truth.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe’s very near the truth in this.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBut I con him no thanks for’t in the nature he delivers it.\n\nPAROLLES.\nPoor rogues, I pray you say.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that’s set down.\n\nPAROLLES.\nI humbly thank you, sir; a truth’s a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n‘Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.’ What say you to that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces.\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat shall be done to him?\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, that’s set down. ‘You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumaine be i’ the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke, what his valour, honesty and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt.’ What say you to this? What do you know of it?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter’gatories. Demand them singly.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nDo you know this Captain Dumaine?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI know him: he was a botcher’s ’prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve’s fool with child, a dumb innocent that could not say him nay.\n\n[First Lord lifts up his hand in anger.]\n\nBERTRAM.\nNay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWell, is this captain in the Duke of Florence’s camp?\n\nPAROLLES.\nUpon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nNay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat is his reputation with the duke?\n\nPAROLLES.\nThe duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him out o’ the band. I think I have his letter in my pocket.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nMarry, we’ll search.\n\nPAROLLES.\nIn good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a file, with the duke’s other letters, in my tent.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHere ’tis; here’s a paper; shall I read it to you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nI do not know if it be it or no.\n\nBERTRAM.\nOur interpreter does it well.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nExcellently.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n[Reads.] Dian, the Count’s a fool, and full of gold.\n\nPAROLLES.\nThat is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rossillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nNay, I’ll read it first by your favour.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.\n\nBERTRAM.\nDamnable both sides rogue!\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\n[Reads.]\nWhen he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;\nAfter he scores, he never pays the score.\nHalf won is match well made; match, and well make it;\nHe ne’er pays after-debts, take it before.\nAnd say a soldier, ‘Dian,’ told thee this:\nMen are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;\nFor count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it,\nWho pays before, but not when he does owe it.\nThine, as he vow’d to thee in thine ear,\n                                     PAROLLES.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHe shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nThis is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the armipotent soldier.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI could endure anything before but a cat, and now he’s a cat to me.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nI perceive, sir, by our general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you.\n\nPAROLLES.\nMy life, sir, in any case. Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i’ the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWe’ll see what may be done, so you confess freely. Therefore, once more to this Captain Dumaine: you have answer’d to his reputation with the duke, and to his valour. What is his honesty?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking them he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty; he has everything that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nI begin to love him for this.\n\nBERTRAM.\nFor this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he’s more and more a cat.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat say you to his expertness in war?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie him I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nHe hath out-villain’d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.\n\nBERTRAM.\nA pox on him! He’s a cat still.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nHis qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.\n\nPAROLLES.\nSir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat’s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?\n\nSECOND LORD.\nWhy does he ask him of me?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nWhat’s he?\n\nPAROLLES.\nE’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nIf your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?\n\nPAROLLES.\nAy, and the captain of his horse, Count Rossillon.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nI’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.\n\nPAROLLES.\n[Aside.] I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have I run into this danger: yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nThere is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.\n\nPAROLLES.\nO Lord! sir, let me live, or let me see my death.\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nThat shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.\n\n[Unmuffling him.]\n\nSo, look about you; know you any here?\n\nBERTRAM.\nGood morrow, noble captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nGod bless you, Captain Parolles.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGod save you, noble captain.\n\nSECOND LORD.\nCaptain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafew? I am for France.\n\nFIRST LORD.\nGood Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rossillon? And I were not a very coward I’d compel it of you; but fare you well.\n\n[Exeunt Bertram, Lords &c.]\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nYou are undone, captain: all but your scarf; that has a knot on’t yet.\n\nPAROLLES.\nWho cannot be crushed with a plot?\n\nFIRST SOLDIER.\nIf you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir. I am for France too; we shall speak of you there.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nPAROLLES.\nYet am I thankful. If my heart were great\n’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more,\nBut I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft\nAs captain shall. Simply the thing I am\nShall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,\nLet him fear this; for it will come to pass\nThat every braggart shall be found an ass.\nRust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles live\nSafest in shame; being fool’d, by foolery thrive.\nThere’s place and means for every man alive.\nI’ll after them.\n\n[Exit.]",

A room in the Countess’s palace.\nEnter Clown, Countess and Lafew.\n\nLAFEW.\nNo, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbak’d and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanc’d by the king than by that red-tail’d humble-bee I speak of.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nI would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love.\n\nLAFEW.\n’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.\n\nCLOWN.\nIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the herb of grace.\n\nLAFEW.\nThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.\n\nLAFEW.\nWhether dost thou profess thyself,—a knave or a fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nA fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.\n\nLAFEW.\nYour distinction?\n\nCLOWN.\nI would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.\n\nLAFEW.\nSo you were a knave at his service indeed.\n\nCLOWN.\nAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\n\nLAFEW.\nI will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.\n\nCLOWN.\nAt your service.\n\nLAFEW.\nNo, no, no.\n\nCLOWN.\nWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are.\n\nLAFEW.\nWho’s that? a Frenchman?\n\nCLOWN.\nFaith, sir, ’a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there.\n\nLAFEW.\nWhat prince is that?\n\nCLOWN.\nThe black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.\n\nLAFEW.\nHold thee, there’s my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talk’st of; serve him still.\n\nCLOWN.\nI am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some that humble themselves may, but the many will be too chill and tender, and they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.\n\nLAFEW.\nGo thy ways, I begin to be a-weary of thee; and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out with thee.

And I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady’s death, and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did first propose. His highness hath promis’d me to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWith very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily effected.\n\nLAFEW.\nHis highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he number’d thirty; he will be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail’d.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nIt rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here tonight.

    "content":"SCENE III. The same. A room in the Countess’s palace.\nFlourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafew, Lords, Gentlemen, Guards &c.\n\nKING.\nWe lost a jewel of her, and our esteem\nWas made much poorer by it; but your son,\nAs mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know\nHer estimation home.\n\nCOUNTESS.\n’Tis past, my liege,\nAnd I beseech your majesty to make it\nNatural rebellion, done i’ the blaze of youth,\nWhen oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,\nO’erbears it and burns on.\n\nKING.\nMy honour’d lady,\nI have forgiven and forgotten all,\nThough my revenges were high bent upon him,\nAnd watch’d the time to shoot.\n\nLAFEW.\nThis I must say,—\nBut first, I beg my pardon,—the young lord\nDid to his majesty, his mother, and his lady,\nOffence of mighty note; but to himself\nThe greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife\nWhose beauty did astonish the survey\nOf richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;\nWhose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve\nHumbly call’d mistress.\n\nKING.\nPraising what is lost\nMakes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;\nWe are reconcil’d, and the first view shall kill\nAll repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;\nThe nature of his great offence is dead,\nAnd deeper than oblivion do we bury\nTh’ incensing relics of it. Let him approach\nA stranger, no offender; and inform him\nSo ’tis our will he should.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nI shall, my liege.\n\n[Exit Gentleman.]\n\nKING.\nWhat says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?\n\nLAFEW.\nAll that he is hath reference to your highness.\n\nKING.\nThen shall we have a match. I have letters sent me\nThat sets him high in fame.\n\nEnter Bertram.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe looks well on ’t.\n\nKING.\nI am not a day of season,\nFor thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail\nIn me at once. But to the brightest beams\nDistracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;\nThe time is fair again.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy high-repented blames\nDear sovereign, pardon to me.\n\nKING.\nAll is whole.\nNot one word more of the consumed time.\nLet’s take the instant by the forward top;\nFor we are old, and on our quick’st decrees\nTh’inaudible and noiseless foot of time\nSteals ere we can effect them. You remember\nThe daughter of this lord?\n\nBERTRAM.\nAdmiringly, my liege. At first\nI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\nDurst make too bold herald of my tongue:\nWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,\nContempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\nWhich warp’d the line of every other favour,\nScorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen,\nExtended or contracted all proportions\nTo a most hideous object. Thence it came\nThat she whom all men prais’d, and whom myself,\nSince I have lost, have lov’d, was in mine eye\nThe dust that did offend it.\n\nKING.\nWell excus’d:\nThat thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\nFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,\nLike a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\nTo the great sender turns a sour offence,\nCrying, That’s good that’s gone. Our rash faults\nMake trivial price of serious things we have,\nNot knowing them until we know their grave.\nOft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,\nDestroy our friends, and after weep their dust:\nOur own love waking cries to see what’s done,\nWhile shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.\nBe this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.\nSend forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.\nThe main consents are had, and here we’ll stay\nTo see our widower’s second marriage-day.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nWhich better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!\nOr, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!\n\nLAFEW.\nCome on, my son, in whom my house’s name\nMust be digested; give a favour from you,\nTo sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,\nThat she may quickly come.\n\n[Bertram gives a ring to Lafew.]\n\nBy my old beard,\nAnd ev’ry hair that’s on ’t, Helen that’s dead\nWas a sweet creature: such a ring as this,\nThe last that e’er I took her leave at court,\nI saw upon her finger.\n\nBERTRAM.\nHers it was not.\n\nKING.\nNow, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,\nWhile I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to it.\nThis ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen\nI bade her, if her fortunes ever stood\nNecessitied to help, that by this token\nI would relieve her. Had you that craft to ’reave her\nOf what should stead her most?\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy gracious sovereign,\nHowe’er it pleases you to take it so,\nThe ring was never hers.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nSon, on my life,\nI have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it\nAt her life’s rate.\n\nLAFEW.\nI am sure I saw her wear it.\n\nBERTRAM.\nYou are deceiv’d, my lord; she never saw it.\nIn Florence was it from a casement thrown me,\nWrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name\nOf her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought\nI stood engag’d; but when I had subscrib’d\nTo mine own fortune, and inform’d her fully\nI could not answer in that course of honour\nAs she had made the overture, she ceas’d,\nIn heavy satisfaction, and would never\nReceive the ring again.\n\nKING.\nPlutus himself,\nThat knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\nHath not in nature’s mystery more science\nThan I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,\nWhoever gave it you. Then if you know\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\nConfess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\nYou got it from her. She call’d the saints to surety\nThat she would never put it from her finger\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\nWhere you have never come, or sent it us\nUpon her great disaster.\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe never saw it.\n\nKING.\nThou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour,\nAnd mak’st conjectural fears to come into me\nWhich I would fain shut out. If it should prove\nThat thou art so inhuman,—’twill not prove so:\nAnd yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly.\nAnd she is dead; which nothing but to close\nHer eyes myself, could win me to believe\nMore than to see this ring. Take him away.\n\n[Guards seize Bertram.]\n\nMy fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall,\nShall tax my fears of little vanity,\nHaving vainly fear’d too little. Away with him.\nWe’ll sift this matter further.\n\nBERTRAM.\nIf you shall prove\nThis ring was ever hers, you shall as easy\nProve that I husbanded her bed in Florence,\nWhere she yet never was.\n\n[Exit, guarded.]\n\nKING.\nI am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.\n\nEnter a Gentleman.\n\nGENTLEMAN.\nGracious sovereign,\nWhether I have been to blame or no, I know not:\nHere’s a petition from a Florentine,\nWho hath for four or five removes come short\nTo tender it herself. I undertook it,\nVanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech\nOf the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,\nIs here attending: her business looks in her\nWith an importing visage, and she told me\nIn a sweet verbal brief, it did concern\nYour highness with herself.\n\nKING.\n[Reads.] Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rossillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour’s paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king, in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.\n                                    DIANA CAPILET.\n\nLAFEW.\nI will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I’ll none of him.\n\nKING.\nThe heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,\nTo bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors.\nGo speedily, and bring again the count.\n\n[Exeunt Gentleman and some Attendants.]\n\nI am afeard the life of Helen, lady,\nWas foully snatch’d.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nNow, justice on the doers!\n\nEnter Bertram, guarded.\n\nKING.\nI wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you,\nAnd that you fly them as you swear them lordship,\nYet you desire to marry. What woman’s that?\n\nEnter Widow and Diana.\n\nDIANA.\nI am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,\nDerived from the ancient Capilet;\nMy suit, as I do understand, you know,\nAnd therefore know how far I may be pitied.\n\nWIDOW.\nI am her mother, sir, whose age and honour\nBoth suffer under this complaint we bring,\nAnd both shall cease, without your remedy.\n\nKING.\nCome hither, count; do you know these women?\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, I neither can nor will deny\nBut that I know them. Do they charge me further?\n\nDIANA.\nWhy do you look so strange upon your wife?\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe’s none of mine, my lord.\n\nDIANA.\nIf you shall marry,\nYou give away this hand, and that is mine,\nYou give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine,\nYou give away myself, which is known mine;\nFor I by vow am so embodied yours\nThat she which marries you must marry me,\nEither both or none.\n\nLAFEW.\n[To Bertram] Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, this is a fond and desperate creature\nWhom sometime I have laugh’d with. Let your highness\nLay a more noble thought upon mine honour\nThan for to think that I would sink it here.\n\nKING.\nSir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend\nTill your deeds gain them; fairer prove your honour\nThan in my thought it lies!\n\nDIANA.\nGood my lord,\nAsk him upon his oath, if he does think\nHe had not my virginity.\n\nKING.\nWhat say’st thou to her?\n\nBERTRAM.\nShe’s impudent, my lord,\nAnd was a common gamester to the camp.\n\nDIANA.\nHe does me wrong, my lord; if I were so\nHe might have bought me at a common price.\nDo not believe him. O, behold this ring,\nWhose high respect and rich validity\nDid lack a parallel; yet for all that\nHe gave it to a commoner o’ the camp,\nIf I be one.\n\nCOUNTESS.\nHe blushes, and ’tis it.\nOf six preceding ancestors, that gem\nConferr’d by testament to th’ sequent issue,\nHath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;\nThat ring’s a thousand proofs.\n\nKING.\nMethought you said\nYou saw one here in court could witness it.\n\nDIANA.\nI did, my lord, but loath am to produce\nSo bad an instrument; his name’s Parolles.\n\nLAFEW.\nI saw the man today, if man he be.\n\nKING.\nFind him, and bring him hither.\n\n[Exit an Attendant.]\n\nBERTRAM.\nWhat of him?\nHe’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,\nWith all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debauch’d:\nWhose nature sickens but to speak a truth.\nAm I or that or this for what he’ll utter,\nThat will speak anything?\n\nKING.\nShe hath that ring of yours.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI think she has. Certain it is I lik’d her\nAnd boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth.\nShe knew her distance, and did angle for me,\nMadding my eagerness with her restraint,\nAs all impediments in fancy’s course\nAre motives of more fancy; and in fine,\nHer infinite cunning with her modern grace,\nSubdu’d me to her rate; she got the ring,\nAnd I had that which any inferior might\nAt market-price have bought.\n\nDIANA.\nI must be patient.\nYou that have turn’d off a first so noble wife\nMay justly diet me. I pray you yet,—\nSince you lack virtue, I will lose a husband—\nSend for your ring, I will return it home,\nAnd give me mine again.\n\nBERTRAM.\nI have it not.\n\nKING.\nWhat ring was yours, I pray you?\n\nDIANA.\nSir, much like\nThe same upon your finger.\n\nKING.\nKnow you this ring? This ring was his of late.\n\nDIANA.\nAnd this was it I gave him, being abed.\n\nKING.\nThe story then goes false you threw it him\nOut of a casement.\n\nDIANA.\nI have spoke the truth.\n\nEnter Attendant with Parolles.\n\nBERTRAM.\nMy lord, I do confess the ring was hers.\n\nKING.\nYou boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.\nIs this the man you speak of?\n\nDIANA.\nAy, my lord.\n\nKING.\nTell me, sirrah, but tell me true I charge you,\nNot fearing the displeasure of your master,\nWhich on your just proceeding, I’ll keep off,—\nBy him and by this woman here what know you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nSo please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman. Tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.\n\nKING.\nCome, come, to the purpose. Did he love this woman?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, sir, he did love her; but how?\n\nKING.\nHow, I pray you?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.\n\nKING.\nHow is that?\n\nPAROLLES.\nHe lov’d her, sir, and lov’d her not.\n\nKING.\nAs thou art a knave and no knave.\nWhat an equivocal companion is this!\n\nPAROLLES.\nI am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.\n\nLAFEW.\nHe’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.\n\nDIANA.\nDo you know he promised me marriage?\n\nPAROLLES.\nFaith, I know more than I’ll speak.\n\nKING.\nBut wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?\n\nPAROLLES.\nYes, so please your majesty. I did go between them as I said; but more than that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan, and of Limbo, and of furies, and I know not what: yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.\n\nKING.\nThou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This ring, you say, was yours?\n\nDIANA.\nAy, my good lord.\n\nKING.\nWhere did you buy it? Or who gave it you?\n\nDIANA.\nIt was not given me, nor I did not buy it.\n\nKING.\nWho lent it you?\n\nDIANA.\nIt was not lent me neither.\n\nKING.\nWhere did you find it then?\n\nDIANA.\nI found it not.\n\nKING.\nIf it were yours by none of all these ways,\nHow could you give it him?\n\nDIANA.\nI never gave it him.\n\nLAFEW.\nThis woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.\n\nKING.\nThis ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.\n\nDIANA.\nIt might be yours or hers for ought I know.\n\nKING.\nTake her away, I do not like her now.\nTo prison with her. And away with him.\nUnless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,\nThou diest within this hour.\n\nDIANA.\nI’ll never tell you.\n\nKING.\nTake her away.\n\nDIANA.\nI’ll put in bail, my liege.\n\nKING.\nI think thee now some common customer.\n\nDIANA.\nBy Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.\n\nKING.\nWherefore hast thou accus’d him all this while?\n\nDIANA.\nBecause he’s guilty, and he is not guilty.\nHe knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t:\nI’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.\nGreat King, I am no strumpet, by my life;\nI am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.\n\n[Pointing to Lafew.]\n\nKING.\nShe does abuse our ears; to prison with her.\n\nDIANA.\nGood mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;\n\n[Exit Widow.]\n\nThe jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,\nAnd he shall surety me. But for this lord\nWho hath abus’d me as he knows himself,\nThough yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him.\nHe knows himself my bed he hath defil’d;\nAnd at that time he got his wife with child.\nDead though she be, she feels her young one kick;\nSo there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick,\nAnd now behold the meaning.\n\nEnter Widow with Helena.\n\nKING.\nIs there no exorcist\nBeguiles the truer office of mine eyes?\nIs’t real that I see?\n\nHELENA.\nNo, my good lord;\n’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,\nThe name, and not the thing.\n\nBERTRAM.\nBoth, both. O, pardon!\n\nHELENA.\nO, my good lord, when I was like this maid;\nI found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,\nAnd, look you, here’s your letter. This it says,\n‘When from my finger you can get this ring,\nAnd is by me with child, &c.’ This is done;\nWill you be mine now you are doubly won?\n\nBERTRAM.\nIf she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,\nI’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\n\nHELENA.\nIf it appear not plain, and prove untrue,\nDeadly divorce step between me and you!\nO my dear mother, do I see you living?\n\nLAFEW.\nMine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon.\n[to Parolles] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.\nSo, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee.\nLet thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.\n\nKING.\nLet us from point to point this story know,\nTo make the even truth in pleasure flow.\n[To Diana.] If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,\nChoose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower;\nFor I can guess that by thy honest aid,\nThou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.\nOf that and all the progress more and less,\nResolvedly more leisure shall express.\nAll yet seems well, and if it end so meet,\nThe bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.\n\n[Flourish.]",
