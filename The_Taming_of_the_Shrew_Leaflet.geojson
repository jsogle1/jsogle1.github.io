Therefore, paucas pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!\n\nHOSTESS.\nYou will not pay for the glasses you have burst?\n\nSLY.\nNo, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed and warm thee.\n\nHOSTESS.\nI know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.\n\n[Exit]\n\nSLY.\nThird, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law. I’ll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly.\n\n[Lies down on the ground, and falls asleep.]\n\nHorns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with Huntsmen and Servants.\n\nLORD.\nHuntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;\nBrach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss’d,\nAnd couple Clowder with the deep-mouth’d brach.\nSaw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good\nAt the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?\nI would not lose the dog for twenty pound.\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nWhy, Bellman is as good as he, my lord;\nHe cried upon it at the merest loss,\nAnd twice today pick’d out the dullest scent;\nTrust me, I take him for the better dog.\n\nLORD.\nThou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,\nI would esteem him worth a dozen such.\nBut sup them well, and look unto them all;\nTomorrow I intend to hunt again.\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nI will, my lord.\n\nLORD.\n[Sees Sly.] What’s here? One dead, or drunk?\nSee, doth he breathe?\n\nSECOND HUNTSMAN.\nHe breathes, my lord. Were he not warm’d with ale,\nThis were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.\n\nLORD.\nO monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!\nGrim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!\nSirs, I will practise on this drunken man.\nWhat think you, if he were convey’d to bed,\nWrapp’d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,\nA most delicious banquet by his bed,\nAnd brave attendants near him when he wakes,\nWould not the beggar then forget himself?\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nBelieve me, lord, I think he cannot choose.\n\nSECOND HUNTSMAN.\nIt would seem strange unto him when he wak’d.\n\nLORD.\nEven as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.\nThen take him up, and manage well the jest.\nCarry him gently to my fairest chamber,\nAnd hang it round with all my wanton pictures;\nBalm his foul head in warm distilled waters,\nAnd burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.\nProcure me music ready when he wakes,\nTo make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;\nAnd if he chance to speak, be ready straight,\nAnd with a low submissive reverence\nSay ‘What is it your honour will command?’\nLet one attend him with a silver basin\nFull of rose-water and bestrew’d with flowers;\nAnother bear the ewer, the third a diaper,\nAnd say ‘Will’t please your lordship cool your hands?’\nSomeone be ready with a costly suit,\nAnd ask him what apparel he will wear;\nAnother tell him of his hounds and horse,\nAnd that his lady mourns at his disease.\nPersuade him that he hath been lunatic;\nAnd, when he says he is—say that he dreams,\nFor he is nothing but a mighty lord.\nThis do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;\nIt will be pastime passing excellent,\nIf it be husbanded with modesty.\n\nFIRST HUNTSMAN.\nMy lord, I warrant you we will play our part,\nAs he shall think by our true diligence,\nHe is no less than what we say he is.\n\nLORD.\nTake him up gently, and to bed with him,\nAnd each one to his office when he wakes.\n\n[Sly is borne out.

This fellow I remember\nSince once he play’d a farmer’s eldest son;\n’Twas where you woo’d the gentlewoman so well.\nI have forgot your name; but, sure, that part\nWas aptly fitted and naturally perform’d.\n\nPLAYER.\nI think ’twas Soto that your honour means.\n\nLORD.\n’Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.\nWell, you are come to me in happy time,\nThe rather for I have some sport in hand\nWherein your cunning can assist me much.\nThere is a lord will hear you play tonight;\nBut I am doubtful of your modesties,\nLest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,—\nFor yet his honour never heard a play,—\nYou break into some merry passion\nAnd so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,\nIf you should smile, he grows impatient.\n\nPLAYER.\nFear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,\nWere he the veriest antick in the world.\n\nLORD.\nGo, sirrah, take them to the buttery,\nAnd give them friendly welcome everyone:\nLet them want nothing that my house affords.\n\n[Exit one with the Players.]\n\nSirrah, go you to Barthol’mew my page,\nAnd see him dress’d in all suits like a lady;\nThat done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,\nAnd call him ‘madam,’ do him obeisance.\nTell him from me—as he will win my love,—\nHe bear himself with honourable action,\nSuch as he hath observ’d in noble ladies\nUnto their lords, by them accomplished;\nSuch duty to the drunkard let him do,\nWith soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,\nAnd say ‘What is’t your honour will command,\nWherein your lady and your humble wife\nMay show her duty and make known her love?’\nAnd then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,\nAnd with declining head into his bosom,\nBid him shed tears, as being overjoy’d\nTo see her noble lord restor’d to health,\nWho for this seven years hath esteemed him\nNo better than a poor and loathsome beggar.\nAnd if the boy have not a woman’s gift\nTo rain a shower of commanded tears,\nAn onion will do well for such a shift,\nWhich, in a napkin being close convey’d,\nShall in despite enforce a watery eye.\nSee this dispatch’d with all the haste thou canst;\nAnon I’ll give thee more instructions.\n\n[Exit Servant.]\n\nI know the boy will well usurp the grace,\nVoice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman;\nI long to hear him call the drunkard husband;\nAnd how my men will stay themselves from laughter\nWhen they do homage to this simple peasant.\nI’ll in to counsel them; haply my presence\nMay well abate the over-merry spleen,\nWhich otherwise would grow into extremes.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

A bedchamber in the Lord’s house.\nSly is discovered in a rich nightgown, with Attendants: some with apparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and Lord, dressed like a servant.\n\nSLY.\nFor God’s sake! a pot of small ale.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nWill’t please your lordship drink a cup of sack?\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWill’t please your honour taste of these conserves?\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nWhat raiment will your honour wear today?\n\nSLY.\nI am Christophero Sly; call not me honour nor lordship. I ne’er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef. Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet: nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather.\n\nLORD.\nHeaven cease this idle humour in your honour!\nO, that a mighty man of such descent,\nOf such possessions, and so high esteem,\nShould be infused with so foul a spirit!\n\nSLY.\nWhat! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton-heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. Here’s—\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nO! this it is that makes your lady mourn.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nO! this is it that makes your servants droop.\n\nLORD.\nHence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,\nAs beaten hence by your strange lunacy.\nO noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,\nCall home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,\nAnd banish hence these abject lowly dreams.\nLook how thy servants do attend on thee,\nEach in his office ready at thy beck:\nWilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,\n\n[Music.]\n\nAnd twenty caged nightingales do sing:\nOr wilt thou sleep? We’ll have thee to a couch\nSofter and sweeter than the lustful bed\nOn purpose trimm’d up for Semiramis.\nSay thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground:\nOr wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp’d,\nTheir harness studded all with gold and pearl.\nDost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar\nAbove the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?\nThy hounds shall make the welkin answer them\nAnd fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nSay thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift\nAs breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nDost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight\nAdonis painted by a running brook,\nAnd Cytherea all in sedges hid,\nWhich seem to move and wanton with her breath\nEven as the waving sedges play with wind.\n\nLORD.\nWe’ll show thee Io as she was a maid\nAnd how she was beguiled and surpris’d,\nAs lively painted as the deed was done.\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nOr Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,\nScratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds\nAnd at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,\nSo workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.\n\nLORD.\nThou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:\nThou hast a lady far more beautiful\nThan any woman in this waning age.\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nAnd, till the tears that she hath shed for thee\nLike envious floods o’er-run her lovely face,\nShe was the fairest creature in the world;\nAnd yet she is inferior to none.\n\nSLY.\nAm I a lord? and have I such a lady?\nOr do I dream? Or have I dream’d till now?\nI do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;\nI smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:\nUpon my life, I am a lord indeed;\nAnd not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.\nWell, bring our lady hither to our sight;\nAnd once again, a pot o’ the smallest ale.\n\nSECOND SERVANT.\nWill’t please your mightiness to wash your hands?\n\n[Servants present a ewer, basin and napkin.]\n\nO, how we joy to see your wit restor’d!\nO, that once more you knew but what you are!\nThese fifteen years you have been in a dream,\nOr, when you wak’d, so wak’d as if you slept.\n\nSLY.\nThese fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.\nBut did I never speak of all that time?\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nO! yes, my lord, but very idle words;\nFor though you lay here in this goodly chamber,\nYet would you say ye were beaten out of door,\nAnd rail upon the hostess of the house,\nAnd say you would present her at the leet,\nBecause she brought stone jugs and no seal’d quarts.\nSometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.\n\nSLY.\nAy, the woman’s maid of the house.\n\nTHIRD SERVANT.\nWhy, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,\nNor no such men as you have reckon’d up,\nAs Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,\nAnd Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;\nAnd twenty more such names and men as these,\nWhich never were, nor no man ever saw.\n\nSLY.\nNow, Lord be thanked for my good amends!\n\nALL.\nAmen.\n\nEnter the Page, as a lady, with Attendants.\n\nSLY.\nI thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.\n\nPAGE.\nHow fares my noble lord?\n\nSLY.\nMarry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.\nWhere is my wife?\n\nPAGE.\nHere, noble lord: what is thy will with her?\n\nSLY.\nAre you my wife, and will not call me husband?\nMy men should call me lord: I am your goodman.\n\nPAGE.\nMy husband and my lord, my lord and husband;\nI am your wife in all obedience.\n\nSLY.\nI know it well.

Servants, leave me and her alone.\nMadam, undress you, and come now to bed.\n\nPAGE.\nThrice noble lord, let me entreat of you\nTo pardon me yet for a night or two;\nOr, if not so, until the sun be set:\nFor your physicians have expressly charg’d,\nIn peril to incur your former malady,\nThat I should yet absent me from your bed:\nI hope this reason stands for my excuse.\n\nSLY.\nAy, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER.\nYour honour’s players, hearing your amendment,\nAre come to play a pleasant comedy;\nFor so your doctors hold it very meet,\nSeeing too much sadness hath congeal’d your blood,\nAnd melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:\nTherefore they thought it good you hear a play,\nAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment,\nWhich bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.\n\nSLY.\nMarry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?\n\nPAGE.\nNo, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.\n\nSLY.\nWhat! household stuff?\n\nPAGE.\nIt is a kind of history.\n\nSLY.\nWell, we’ll see’t. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let the world slip: we shall ne’er be younger.",

Enter Lucentio and Tranio.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, since for the great desire I had\nTo see fair Padua, nursery of arts,\nI am arriv’d for fruitful Lombardy,\nThe pleasant garden of great Italy,\nAnd by my father’s love and leave am arm’d\nWith his good will and thy good company,\nMy trusty servant well approv’d in all,\nHere let us breathe, and haply institute\nA course of learning and ingenious studies.\nPisa, renowned for grave citizens,\nGave me my being and my father first,\nA merchant of great traffic through the world,\nVincentio, come of the Bentivolii.\nVincentio’s son, brought up in Florence,\nIt shall become to serve all hopes conceiv’d,\nTo deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:\nAnd therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,\nVirtue and that part of philosophy\nWill I apply that treats of happiness\nBy virtue specially to be achiev’d.\nTell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left\nAnd am to Padua come as he that leaves\nA shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,\nAnd with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.\n\nTRANIO.\nMi perdonato, gentle master mine;\nI am in all affected as yourself;\nGlad that you thus continue your resolve\nTo suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.\nOnly, good master, while we do admire\nThis virtue and this moral discipline,\nLet’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;\nOr so devote to Aristotle’s checks\nAs Ovid be an outcast quite abjur’d.\nBalk logic with acquaintance that you have,\nAnd practise rhetoric in your common talk;\nMusic and poesy use to quicken you;\nThe mathematics and the metaphysics,\nFall to them as you find your stomach serves you:\nNo profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en;\nIn brief, sir, study what you most affect.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nGramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.\nIf, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,\nWe could at once put us in readiness,\nAnd take a lodging fit to entertain\nSuch friends as time in Padua shall beget.\nBut stay awhile; what company is this?\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, some show to welcome us to town.\n\n[Lucentio and Tranio stand aside.]\n\nEnter Baptista, Katherina, Bianca, Gremio and Hortensio.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nGentlemen, importune me no farther,\nFor how I firmly am resolv’d you know;\nThat is, not to bestow my youngest daughter\nBefore I have a husband for the elder.\nIf either of you both love Katherina,\nBecause I know you well and love you well,\nLeave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.\n\nGREMIO.\nTo cart her rather: she’s too rough for me.\nThere, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?\n\nKATHERINA.\n[To Baptista] I pray you, sir, is it your will\nTo make a stale of me amongst these mates?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nMates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,\nUnless you were of gentler, milder mould.\n\nKATHERINA.\nI’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;\nI wis it is not half way to her heart;\nBut if it were, doubt not her care should be\nTo comb your noddle with a three-legg’d stool,\nAnd paint your face, and use you like a fool.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nFrom all such devils, good Lord deliver us!\n\nGREMIO.\nAnd me, too, good Lord!\n\nTRANIO.\nHusht, master! Here’s some good pastime toward:\nThat wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nBut in the other’s silence do I see\nMaid’s mild behaviour and sobriety.\nPeace, Tranio!\n\nTRANIO.\nWell said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nGentlemen, that I may soon make good\nWhat I have said,—Bianca, get you in:\nAnd let it not displease thee, good Bianca,\nFor I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl.\n\nKATHERINA.\nA pretty peat! it is best put finger in the eye, and she knew why.\n\nBIANCA.\nSister, content you in my discontent.\nSir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:\nMy books and instruments shall be my company,\nOn them to look, and practise by myself.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nHark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSignior Baptista, will you be so strange?\nSorry am I that our good will effects\nBianca’s grief.\n\nGREMIO.\nWhy will you mew her up,\nSignior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,\nAnd make her bear the penance of her tongue?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nGentlemen, content ye; I am resolv’d.\nGo in, Bianca.\n\n[Exit Bianca.]\n\nAnd for I know she taketh most delight\nIn music, instruments, and poetry,\nSchoolmasters will I keep within my house\nFit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,\nOr, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,\nPrefer them hither; for to cunning men\nI will be very kind, and liberal\nTo mine own children in good bringing up;\nAnd so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;\nFor I have more to commune with Bianca.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nKATHERINA.\nWhy, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!\n\n[Exit.]\n\nGREMIO.\nYou may go to the devil’s dam: your gifts are so good here’s none will hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out; our cake’s dough on both sides. Farewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSo will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,—that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love,—to labour and effect one thing specially.\n\nGREMIO.\nWhat’s that, I pray?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nMarry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.\n\nGREMIO.\nA husband! a devil.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nI say, a husband.\n\nGREMIO.\nI say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nTush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.\n\nGREMIO.\nI cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipp’d at the high cross every morning.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nFaith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained, till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a husband, we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to’t afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?\n\nGREMIO.\nI am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her. Come on.\n\n[Exeunt Gremio and Hortensio.]\n\nTRANIO.\nI pray, sir, tell me, is it possible\nThat love should of a sudden take such hold?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nO Tranio! till I found it to be true,\nI never thought it possible or likely;\nBut see, while idly I stood looking on,\nI found the effect of love in idleness;\nAnd now in plainness do confess to thee,\nThat art to me as secret and as dear\nAs Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,\nTranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,\nIf I achieve not this young modest girl.\nCounsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:\nAssist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, it is no time to chide you now;\nAffection is not rated from the heart:\nIf love have touch’d you, nought remains but so:\nRedime te captum quam queas minimo.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nGramercies, lad; go forward; this contents;\nThe rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, you look’d so longly on the maid.\nPerhaps you mark’d not what’s the pith of all.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nO, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,\nSuch as the daughter of Agenor had,\nThat made great Jove to humble him to her hand,\nWhen with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strand.\n\nTRANIO.\nSaw you no more? mark’d you not how her sister\nBegan to scold and raise up such a storm\nThat mortal ears might hardly endure the din?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, I saw her coral lips to move,\nAnd with her breath she did perfume the air;\nSacred and sweet was all I saw in her.\n\nTRANIO.\nNay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance.\nI pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,\nBend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:\nHer elder sister is so curst and shrewd,\nThat till the father rid his hands of her,\nMaster, your love must live a maid at home;\nAnd therefore has he closely mew’d her up,\nBecause she will not be annoy’d with suitors.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAh, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!\nBut art thou not advis’d he took some care\nTo get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?\n\nTRANIO.\nAy, marry, am I, sir, and now ’tis plotted.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI have it, Tranio.\n\nTRANIO.\nMaster, for my hand,\nBoth our inventions meet and jump in one.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTell me thine first.\n\nTRANIO.\nYou will be schoolmaster,\nAnd undertake the teaching of the maid:\nThat’s your device.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nIt is: may it be done?\n\nTRANIO.\nNot possible; for who shall bear your part\nAnd be in Padua here Vincentio’s son;\nKeep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;\nVisit his countrymen, and banquet them?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nBasta, content thee, for I have it full.\nWe have not yet been seen in any house,\nNor can we be distinguish’d by our faces\nFor man or master: then it follows thus:\nThou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,\nKeep house and port and servants, as I should;\nI will some other be; some Florentine,\nSome Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.\n’Tis hatch’d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once\nUncase thee; take my colour’d hat and cloak.\nWhen Biondello comes, he waits on thee;\nBut I will charm him first to keep his tongue.\n\n[They exchange habits]\n\nTRANIO.\nSo had you need.\nIn brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,\nAnd I am tied to be obedient;\nFor so your father charg’d me at our parting,\n‘Be serviceable to my son,’ quoth he,\nAlthough I think ’twas in another sense:\nI am content to be Lucentio,\nBecause so well I love Lucentio.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;\nAnd let me be a slave, to achieve that maid\nWhose sudden sight hath thrall’d my wounded eye.\n\nEnter Biondello.\n\nHere comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWhere have I been? Nay, how now! where are you?\nMaster, has my fellow Tranio stol’n your clothes?\nOr you stol’n his? or both? Pray, what’s the news?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nSirrah, come hither: ’tis no time to jest,\nAnd therefore frame your manners to the time.\nYour fellow Tranio here, to save my life,\nPuts my apparel and my count’nance on,\nAnd I for my escape have put on his;\nFor in a quarrel since I came ashore\nI kill’d a man, and fear I was descried.\nWait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,\nWhile I make way from hence to save my life.\nYou understand me?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nI, sir! Ne’er a whit.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAnd not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:\nTranio is changed to Lucentio.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nThe better for him: would I were so too!\n\nTRANIO.\nSo could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,\nThat Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.\nBut, sirrah, not for my sake but your master’s, I advise\nYou use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:\nWhen I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;\nBut in all places else your master, Lucentio.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTranio, let’s go.\nOne thing more rests, that thyself execute,\nTo make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why,\nSufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n[The Presenters above speak.]\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nMy lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.\n\nSLY.\nYes, by Saint Anne, I do. A good matter, surely: comes there any more of it?\n\nPAGE.\nMy lord, ’tis but begun.\n\nSLY.\n’Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady: would ’twere done!\n\n[They sit and mark.]",

    "content":"SCENE II. Padua. Before Hortensio’s house.\nEnter Petruchio and his man Grumio.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nVerona, for a while I take my leave,\nTo see my friends in Padua; but of all\nMy best beloved and approved friend,\nHortensio; and I trow this is his house.\nHere, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.\n\nGRUMIO.\nKnock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your worship?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nVillain, I say, knock me here soundly.\n\nGRUMIO.\nKnock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nVillain, I say, knock me at this gate;\nAnd rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.\n\nGRUMIO.\nMy master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,\nAnd then I know after who comes by the worst.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWill it not be?\nFaith, sirrah, and you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it;\nI’ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.\n\n[He wrings Grumio by the ears.]\n\nGRUMIO.\nHelp, masters, help! my master is mad.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNow, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!\n\nEnter Hortensio.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nHow now! what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSignior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?\nCon tutto il cuore ben trovato, may I say.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nAlla nostra casa ben venuto; molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.\nRise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.\n\nGRUMIO.\nNay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had well knock’d at first, then had not Grumio come by the worst.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA senseless villain! Good Hortensio,\nI bade the rascal knock upon your gate,\nAnd could not get him for my heart to do it.\n\nGRUMIO.\nKnock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: ‘Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly’? And come you now with ‘knocking at the gate’?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPetruchio, patience; I am Grumio’s pledge;\nWhy, this’s a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,\nYour ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.\nAnd tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale\nBlows you to Padua here from old Verona?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSuch wind as scatters young men through the world\nTo seek their fortunes farther than at home,\nWhere small experience grows. But in a few,\nSignior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:\nAntonio, my father, is deceas’d,\nAnd I have thrust myself into this maze,\nHaply to wive and thrive as best I may;\nCrowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,\nAnd so am come abroad to see the world.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPetruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee\nAnd wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour’d wife?\nThou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel;\nAnd yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,\nAnd very rich: but th’art too much my friend,\nAnd I’ll not wish thee to her.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSignior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we\nFew words suffice; and therefore, if thou know\nOne rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife,\nAs wealth is burden of my wooing dance,\nBe she as foul as was Florentius’ love,\nAs old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd\nAs Socrates’ Xanthippe or a worse,\nShe moves me not, or not removes, at least,\nAffection’s edge in me, were she as rough\nAs are the swelling Adriatic seas:\nI come to wive it wealthily in Padua;\nIf wealthily, then happily in Padua.\n\nGRUMIO.\nNay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPetruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in,\nI will continue that I broach’d in jest.\nI can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife\nWith wealth enough, and young and beauteous;\nBrought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:\nHer only fault,—and that is faults enough,—\nIs, that she is intolerable curst,\nAnd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,\nThat, were my state far worser than it is,\nI would not wed her for a mine of gold.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nHortensio, peace! thou know’st not gold’s effect:\nTell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough;\nFor I will board her, though she chide as loud\nAs thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nHer father is Baptista Minola,\nAn affable and courteous gentleman;\nHer name is Katherina Minola,\nRenown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI know her father, though I know not her;\nAnd he knew my deceased father well.\nI will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;\nAnd therefore let me be thus bold with you,\nTo give you over at this first encounter,\nUnless you will accompany me thither.\n\nGRUMIO.\nI pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O’ my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so; why, that’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll tell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nTarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,\nFor in Baptista’s keep my treasure is:\nHe hath the jewel of my life in hold,\nHis youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,\nAnd her withholds from me and other more,\nSuitors to her and rivals in my love;\nSupposing it a thing impossible,\nFor those defects I have before rehears’d,\nThat ever Katherina will be woo’d:\nTherefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,\nThat none shall have access unto Bianca\nTill Katherine the curst have got a husband.\n\nGRUMIO.\nKatherine the curst!\nA title for a maid of all titles the worst.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nNow shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,\nAnd offer me disguis’d in sober robes,\nTo old Baptista as a schoolmaster\nWell seen in music, to instruct Bianca;\nThat so I may, by this device at least\nHave leave and leisure to make love to her,\nAnd unsuspected court her by herself.\n\nGRUMIO.\nHere’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!\n\nEnter Gremio and Lucentio disguised, with books under his arm.\n\nMaster, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nPeace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by awhile.\n\nGRUMIO.\nA proper stripling, and an amorous!\n\nGREMIO.\nO! very well; I have perus’d the note.\nHark you, sir; I’ll have them very fairly bound:\nAll books of love, see that at any hand,\nAnd see you read no other lectures to her.\nYou understand me. Over and beside\nSignior Baptista’s liberality,\nI’ll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,\nAnd let me have them very well perfum’d;\nFor she is sweeter than perfume itself\nTo whom they go to. What will you read to her?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nWhate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you,\nAs for my patron, stand you so assur’d,\nAs firmly as yourself were still in place;\nYea, and perhaps with more successful words\nThan you, unless you were a scholar, sir.\n\nGREMIO.\nO! this learning, what a thing it is.\n\nGRUMIO.\nO! this woodcock, what an ass it is.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nPeace, sirrah!\n\nHORTENSIO.\nGrumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio!\n\nGREMIO.\nAnd you are well met, Signior Hortensio.\nTrow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.\nI promis’d to enquire carefully\nAbout a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;\nAnd by good fortune I have lighted well\nOn this young man; for learning and behaviour\nFit for her turn, well read in poetry\nAnd other books, good ones, I warrant ye.\n\nHORTENSIO.\n’Tis well; and I have met a gentleman\nHath promis’d me to help me to another,\nA fine musician to instruct our mistress:\nSo shall I no whit be behind in duty\nTo fair Bianca, so belov’d of me.\n\nGREMIO.\nBelov’d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.\n\nGRUMIO.\n[Aside.] And that his bags shall prove.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nGremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love:\nListen to me, and if you speak me fair,\nI’ll tell you news indifferent good for either.\nHere is a gentleman whom by chance I met,\nUpon agreement from us to his liking,\nWill undertake to woo curst Katherine;\nYea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.\n\nGREMIO.\nSo said, so done, is well.\nHortensio, have you told him all her faults?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI know she is an irksome brawling scold;\nIf that be all, masters, I hear no harm.\n\nGREMIO.\nNo, say’st me so, friend? What countryman?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nBorn in Verona, old Antonio’s son.\nMy father dead, my fortune lives for me;\nAnd I do hope good days and long to see.\n\nGREMIO.\nO sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!\nBut if you have a stomach, to’t a God’s name;\nYou shall have me assisting you in all.\nBut will you woo this wild-cat?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWill I live?\n\nGRUMIO.\nWill he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhy came I hither but to that intent?\nThink you a little din can daunt mine ears?\nHave I not in my time heard lions roar?\nHave I not heard the sea, puff’d up with winds,\nRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?\nHave I not heard great ordnance in the field,\nAnd heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?\nHave I not in a pitched battle heard\nLoud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?\nAnd do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,\nThat gives not half so great a blow to hear\nAs will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?\nTush, tush! fear boys with bugs.\n\nGRUMIO.\n[Aside] For he fears none.\n\nGREMIO.\nHortensio, hark:\nThis gentleman is happily arriv’d,\nMy mind presumes, for his own good and yours.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nI promis’d we would be contributors,\nAnd bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe’er.\n\nGREMIO.\nAnd so we will, provided that he win her.\n\nGRUMIO.\nI would I were as sure of a good dinner.\n\nEnter Tranio brave, and Biondello.\n\nTRANIO.\nGentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,\nTell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way\nTo the house of Signior Baptista Minola?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nHe that has the two fair daughters; is’t he you mean?\n\nTRANIO.\nEven he, Biondello!\n\nGREMIO.\nHark you, sir, you mean not her to—\n\nTRANIO.\nPerhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNot her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.\n\nTRANIO.\nI love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let’s away.\n\nLUCENTIO.\n[Aside] Well begun, Tranio.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSir, a word ere you go.\nAre you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?\n\nTRANIO.\nAnd if I be, sir, is it any offence?\n\nGREMIO.\nNo; if without more words you will get you hence.\n\nTRANIO.\nWhy, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free\nFor me as for you?\n\nGREMIO.\nBut so is not she.\n\nTRANIO.\nFor what reason, I beseech you?\n\nGREMIO.\nFor this reason, if you’ll know,\nThat she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nThat she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.\n\nTRANIO.\nSoftly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,\nDo me this right; hear me with patience.\nBaptista is a noble gentleman,\nTo whom my father is not all unknown;\nAnd were his daughter fairer than she is,\nShe may more suitors have, and me for one.\nFair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers;\nThen well one more may fair Bianca have;\nAnd so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,\nThough Paris came in hope to speed alone.\n\nGREMIO.\nWhat, this gentleman will out-talk us all.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nSir, give him head; I know he’ll prove a jade.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nHortensio, to what end are all these words?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSir, let me be so bold as ask you,\nDid you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?\n\nTRANIO.\nNo, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,\nThe one as famous for a scolding tongue\nAs is the other for beauteous modesty.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSir, sir, the first’s for me; let her go by.\n\nGREMIO.\nYea, leave that labour to great Hercules,\nAnd let it be more than Alcides’ twelve.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSir, understand you this of me, in sooth:\nThe youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,\nHer father keeps from all access of suitors,\nAnd will not promise her to any man\nUntil the elder sister first be wed;\nThe younger then is free, and not before.\n\nTRANIO.\nIf it be so, sir, that you are the man\nMust stead us all, and me amongst the rest;\nAnd if you break the ice, and do this feat,\nAchieve the elder, set the younger free\nFor our access, whose hap shall be to have her\nWill not so graceless be to be ingrate.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSir, you say well, and well you do conceive;\nAnd since you do profess to be a suitor,\nYou must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,\nTo whom we all rest generally beholding.\n\nTRANIO.\nSir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,\nPlease ye we may contrive this afternoon,\nAnd quaff carouses to our mistress’ health;\nAnd do as adversaries do in law,\nStrive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.\n\nGRUMIO, BIONDELLO.\nO excellent motion! Fellows, let’s be gone.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nThe motion’s good indeed, and be it so:—\nPetruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

God save you, gentlemen!\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nAnd you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter\nCall’d Katherina, fair and virtuous?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nI have a daughter, sir, call’d Katherina.\n\nGREMIO.\nYou are too blunt: go to it orderly.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nYou wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.\nI am a gentleman of Verona, sir,\nThat, hearing of her beauty and her wit,\nHer affability and bashful modesty,\nHer wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,\nAm bold to show myself a forward guest\nWithin your house, to make mine eye the witness\nOf that report which I so oft have heard.\nAnd, for an entrance to my entertainment,\nI do present you with a man of mine,\n\n[Presenting Hortensio.]\n\nCunning in music and the mathematics,\nTo instruct her fully in those sciences,\nWhereof I know she is not ignorant.\nAccept of him, or else you do me wrong:\nHis name is Licio, born in Mantua.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nY’are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;\nBut for my daughter Katherine, this I know,\nShe is not for your turn, the more my grief.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI see you do not mean to part with her;\nOr else you like not of my company.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nMistake me not; I speak but as I find.\nWhence are you, sir? What may I call your name?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nPetruchio is my name, Antonio’s son;\nA man well known throughout all Italy.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nI know him well: you are welcome for his sake.\n\nGREMIO.\nSaving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,\nLet us, that are poor petitioners, speak too.\nBackare! you are marvellous forward.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nO, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.\n\nGREMIO.\nI doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar,\n\n[Presenting Lucentio.]\n\nthat has been long studying at Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio; pray accept his service.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nA thousand thanks, Signior Gremio; welcome, good Cambio. [To Tranio.] But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?\n\nTRANIO.\nPardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,\nThat, being a stranger in this city here,\nDo make myself a suitor to your daughter,\nUnto Bianca, fair and virtuous.\nNor is your firm resolve unknown to me,\nIn the preferment of the eldest sister.\nThis liberty is all that I request,\nThat, upon knowledge of my parentage,\nI may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo,\nAnd free access and favour as the rest:\nAnd, toward the education of your daughters,\nI here bestow a simple instrument,\nAnd this small packet of Greek and Latin books:\nIf you accept them, then their worth is great.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nLucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?\n\nTRANIO.\nOf Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nA mighty man of Pisa: by report\nI know him well: you are very welcome, sir.\n[To Hortensio.] Take you the lute,\n[To Lucentio.] and you the set of books;\nYou shall go see your pupils presently.\nHolla, within!\n\nEnter a Servant.\n\nSirrah, lead these gentlemen\nTo my daughters, and tell them both\nThese are their tutors: bid them use them well.\n\n[Exeunt Servant with Hortensio, Lucentio and Biondello.]\n\nWe will go walk a little in the orchard,\nAnd then to dinner. You are passing welcome,\nAnd so I pray you all to think yourselves.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSignior Baptista, my business asketh haste,\nAnd every day I cannot come to woo.\nYou knew my father well, and in him me,\nLeft solely heir to all his lands and goods,\nWhich I have bettered rather than decreas’d:\nThen tell me, if I get your daughter’s love,\nWhat dowry shall I have with her to wife?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nAfter my death, the one half of my lands,\nAnd in possession twenty thousand crowns.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nAnd, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of\nHer widowhood, be it that she survive me,\nIn all my lands and leases whatsoever.\nLet specialities be therefore drawn between us,\nThat covenants may be kept on either hand.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nAy, when the special thing is well obtain’d,\nThat is, her love; for that is all in all.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhy, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,\nI am as peremptory as she proud-minded;\nAnd where two raging fires meet together,\nThey do consume the thing that feeds their fury:\nThough little fire grows great with little wind,\nYet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;\nSo I to her, and so she yields to me;\nFor I am rough and woo not like a babe.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWell mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!\nBut be thou arm’d for some unhappy words.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nAy, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,\nThat shake not though they blow perpetually.\n\nRe-enter Hortensio, with his head broke.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nHow now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nFor fear, I promise you, if I look pale.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWhat, will my daughter prove a good musician?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nI think she’ll sooner prove a soldier:\nIron may hold with her, but never lutes.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWhy, then thou canst not break her to the lute?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nWhy, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.\nI did but tell her she mistook her frets,\nAnd bow’d her hand to teach her fingering;\nWhen, with a most impatient devilish spirit,\n‘Frets, call you these?’ quoth she ‘I’ll fume with them’;\nAnd with that word she struck me on the head,\nAnd through the instrument my pate made way;\nAnd there I stood amazed for a while,\nAs on a pillory, looking through the lute;\nWhile she did call me rascal fiddler,\nAnd twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,\nAs had she studied to misuse me so.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNow, by the world, it is a lusty wench!\nI love her ten times more than e’er I did:\nO! how I long to have some chat with her!\n\nBAPTISTA.\n[To Hortensio.] Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;\nProceed in practice with my younger daughter;\nShe’s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.\nSignior Petruchio, will you go with us,\nOr shall I send my daughter Kate to you?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI pray you do.\n\n[Exeunt Baptista, Gremio, Tranio and Hortensio.]\n\nI will attend her here,\nAnd woo her with some spirit when she comes.\nSay that she rail; why, then I’ll tell her plain\nShe sings as sweetly as a nightingale:\nSay that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear\nAs morning roses newly wash’d with dew:\nSay she be mute, and will not speak a word;\nThen I’ll commend her volubility,\nAnd say she uttereth piercing eloquence:\nIf she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks,\nAs though she bid me stay by her a week:\nIf she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day\nWhen I shall ask the banns, and when be married.\nBut here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.\n\nEnter Katherina.\n\nGood morrow, Kate; for that’s your name, I hear.\n\nKATHERINA.\nWell have you heard, but something hard of hearing:\nThey call me Katherine that do talk of me.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nYou lie, in faith, for you are call’d plain Kate,\nAnd bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;\nBut, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,\nKate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,\nFor dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,\nTake this of me, Kate of my consolation;\nHearing thy mildness prais’d in every town,\nThy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,—\nYet not so deeply as to thee belongs,—\nMyself am mov’d to woo thee for my wife.\n\nKATHERINA.\nMov’d! in good time: let him that mov’d you hither\nRemove you hence. I knew you at the first,\nYou were a moveable.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhy, what’s a moveable?\n\nKATHERINA.\nA joint-stool.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nThou hast hit it: come, sit on me.\n\nKATHERINA.\nAsses are made to bear, and so are you.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWomen are made to bear, and so are you.\n\nKATHERINA.\nNo such jade as bear you, if me you mean.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nAlas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;\nFor, knowing thee to be but young and light,—\n\nKATHERINA.\nToo light for such a swain as you to catch;\nAnd yet as heavy as my weight should be.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nShould be! should buz!\n\nKATHERINA.\nWell ta’en, and like a buzzard.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nO, slow-wing’d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?\n\nKATHERINA.\nAy, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nCome, come, you wasp; i’ faith, you are too angry.\n\nKATHERINA.\nIf I be waspish, best beware my sting.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nMy remedy is then to pluck it out.\n\nKATHERINA.\nAy, if the fool could find it where it lies.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWho knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?\nIn his tail.\n\nKATHERINA.\nIn his tongue.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhose tongue?\n\nKATHERINA.\nYours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhat! with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,\nGood Kate; I am a gentleman.\n\nKATHERINA.\nThat I’ll try.\n\n[Striking him.]\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.\n\nKATHERINA.\nSo may you lose your arms:\nIf you strike me, you are no gentleman;\nAnd if no gentleman, why then no arms.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA herald, Kate? O! put me in thy books.\n\nKATHERINA.\nWhat is your crest? a coxcomb?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.\n\nKATHERINA.\nNo cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.\n\nKATHERINA.\nIt is my fashion when I see a crab.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhy, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.\n\nKATHERINA.\nThere is, there is.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nThen show it me.\n\nKATHERINA.\nHad I a glass I would.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhat, you mean my face?\n\nKATHERINA.\nWell aim’d of such a young one.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNow, by Saint George, I am too young for you.\n\nKATHERINA.\nYet you are wither’d.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\n’Tis with cares.\n\nKATHERINA.\nI care not.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNay, hear you, Kate: in sooth, you ’scape not so.\n\nKATHERINA.\nI chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNo, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.\n’Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,\nAnd now I find report a very liar;\nFor thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,\nBut slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers.\nThou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,\nNor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,\nNor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;\nBut thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers;\nWith gentle conference, soft and affable.\nWhy does the world report that Kate doth limp?\nO sland’rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig\nIs straight and slender, and as brown in hue\nAs hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.\nO! let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.\n\nKATHERINA.\nGo, fool, and whom thou keep’st command.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nDid ever Dian so become a grove\nAs Kate this chamber with her princely gait?\nO! be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,\nAnd then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!\n\nKATHERINA.\nWhere did you study all this goodly speech?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nIt is extempore, from my mother-wit.\n\nKATHERINA.\nA witty mother! witless else her son.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nAm I not wise?\n\nKATHERINA.\nYes; keep you warm.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nMarry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed;\nAnd therefore, setting all this chat aside,\nThus in plain terms: your father hath consented\nThat you shall be my wife your dowry ’greed on;\nAnd will you, nill you, I will marry you.\nNow, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;\nFor, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,—\nThy beauty that doth make me like thee well,—\nThou must be married to no man but me;\nFor I am he am born to tame you, Kate,\nAnd bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate\nConformable as other household Kates.\n\nRe-enter Baptista, Gremio and Tranio.\n\nHere comes your father. Never make denial;\nI must and will have Katherine to my wife.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nNow, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nHow but well, sir? how but well?\nIt were impossible I should speed amiss.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWhy, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?\n\nKATHERINA.\nCall you me daughter? Now I promise you\nYou have show’d a tender fatherly regard\nTo wish me wed to one half lunatic,\nA mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,\nThat thinks with oaths to face the matter out.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nFather, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world\nThat talk’d of her have talk’d amiss of her:\nIf she be curst, it is for policy,\nFor she’s not froward, but modest as the dove;\nShe is not hot, but temperate as the morn;\nFor patience she will prove a second Grissel,\nAnd Roman Lucrece for her chastity;\nAnd to conclude, we have ’greed so well together\nThat upon Sunday is the wedding-day.\n\nKATHERINA.\nI’ll see thee hang’d on Sunday first.\n\nGREMIO.\nHark, Petruchio; she says she’ll see thee hang’d first.\n\nTRANIO.\nIs this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nBe patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;\nIf she and I be pleas’d, what’s that to you?\n’Tis bargain’d ’twixt us twain, being alone,\nThat she shall still be curst in company.\nI tell you, ’tis incredible to believe\nHow much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate\nShe hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss\nShe vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,\nThat in a twink she won me to her love.\nO! you are novices: ’tis a world to see,\nHow tame, when men and women are alone,\nA meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.\nGive me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,\nTo buy apparel ’gainst the wedding-day.\nProvide the feast, father, and bid the guests;\nI will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nI know not what to say; but give me your hands.\nGod send you joy, Petruchio! ’Tis a match.\n\nGREMIO, TRANIO.\nAmen, say we; we will be witnesses.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nFather, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.\nI will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;\nWe will have rings and things, and fine array;\nAnd kiss me, Kate; we will be married o’ Sunday.\n\n[Exeunt Petruchio and Katherina, severally.]\n\nGREMIO.\nWas ever match clapp’d up so suddenly?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nFaith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part,\nAnd venture madly on a desperate mart.\n\nTRANIO.\n’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;\n’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nThe gain I seek is, quiet in the match.\n\nGREMIO.\nNo doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.\nBut now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:\nNow is the day we long have looked for;\nI am your neighbour, and was suitor first.\n\nTRANIO.\nAnd I am one that love Bianca more\nThan words can witness or your thoughts can guess.\n\nGREMIO.\nYoungling, thou canst not love so dear as I.\n\nTRANIO.\nGreybeard, thy love doth freeze.\n\nGREMIO.\nBut thine doth fry.\nSkipper, stand back; ’tis age that nourisheth.\n\nTRANIO.\nBut youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nContent you, gentlemen; I’ll compound this strife:\n’Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both\nThat can assure my daughter greatest dower\nShall have my Bianca’s love.\nSay, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?\n\nGREMIO.\nFirst, as you know, my house within the city\nIs richly furnished with plate and gold:\nBasins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;\nMy hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;\nIn ivory coffers I have stuff’d my crowns;\nIn cypress chests my arras counterpoints,\nCostly apparel, tents, and canopies,\nFine linen, Turkey cushions boss’d with pearl,\nValance of Venice gold in needlework;\nPewter and brass, and all things that belong\nTo house or housekeeping: then, at my farm\nI have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,\nSix score fat oxen standing in my stalls,\nAnd all things answerable to this portion.\nMyself am struck in years, I must confess;\nAnd if I die tomorrow this is hers,\nIf whilst I live she will be only mine.\n\nTRANIO.\nThat ‘only’ came well in. Sir, list to me:\nI am my father’s heir and only son;\nIf I may have your daughter to my wife,\nI’ll leave her houses three or four as good\nWithin rich Pisa’s walls as anyone\nOld Signior Gremio has in Padua;\nBesides two thousand ducats by the year\nOf fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.\nWhat, have I pinch’d you, Signior Gremio?\n\nGREMIO.\nTwo thousand ducats by the year of land!\nMy land amounts not to so much in all:\nThat she shall have, besides an argosy\nThat now is lying in Marseilles’ road.\nWhat, have I chok’d you with an argosy?\n\nTRANIO.\nGremio, ’tis known my father hath no less\nThan three great argosies, besides two galliasses,\nAnd twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her,\nAnd twice as much, whate’er thou offer’st next.\n\nGREMIO.\nNay, I have offer’d all; I have no more;\nAnd she can have no more than all I have;\nIf you like me, she shall have me and mine.\n\nTRANIO.\nWhy, then the maid is mine from all the world,\nBy your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nI must confess your offer is the best;\nAnd let your father make her the assurance,\nShe is your own; else, you must pardon me;\nIf you should die before him, where’s her dower?\n\nTRANIO.\nThat’s but a cavil; he is old, I young.\n\nGREMIO.\nAnd may not young men die as well as old?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWell, gentlemen,\nI am thus resolv’d. On Sunday next, you know,\nMy daughter Katherine is to be married;\nNow, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca\nBe bride to you, if you make this assurance;\nIf not, to Signior Gremio.\nAnd so I take my leave, and thank you both.\n\nGREMIO.\nAdieu, good neighbour.\n\n[Exit Baptista.]\n\nNow, I fear thee not:\nSirrah young gamester, your father were a fool\nTo give thee all, and in his waning age\nSet foot under thy table. Tut! a toy!\nAn old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nTRANIO.\nA vengeance on your crafty wither’d hide!\nYet I have fac’d it with a card of ten.\n’Tis in my head to do my master good:\nI see no reason but suppos’d Lucentio\nMust get a father, call’d suppos’d Vincentio;\nAnd that’s a wonder: fathers commonly\nDo get their children; but in this case of wooing\nA child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.\n\n[Exit.]",

[To Tranio.]\nSignior Lucentio, this is the ’pointed day\nThat Katherine and Petruchio should be married,\nAnd yet we hear not of our son-in-law.\nWhat will be said? What mockery will it be\nTo want the bridegroom when the priest attends\nTo speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!\nWhat says Lucentio to this shame of ours?\n\nKATHERINA.\nNo shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc’d\nTo give my hand, oppos’d against my heart,\nUnto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen;\nWho woo’d in haste and means to wed at leisure.\nI told you, I, he was a frantic fool,\nHiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;\nAnd to be noted for a merry man,\nHe’ll woo a thousand, ’point the day of marriage,\nMake friends, invite, and proclaim the banns;\nYet never means to wed where he hath woo’d.\nNow must the world point at poor Katherine,\nAnd say ‘Lo! there is mad Petruchio’s wife,\nIf it would please him come and marry her.’\n\nTRANIO.\nPatience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.\nUpon my life, Petruchio means but well,\nWhatever fortune stays him from his word:\nThough he be blunt, I know him passing wise;\nThough he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.\n\nKATHERINA.\nWould Katherine had never seen him though!\n\n[Exit weeping, followed by Bianca and others.]\n\nBAPTISTA.\nGo, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,\nFor such an injury would vex a very saint;\nMuch more a shrew of thy impatient humour.\n\nEnter Biondello.\n\nMaster, master! News! old news, and such news as you never heard of!\n\nBAPTISTA.\nIs it new and old too? How may that be?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWhy, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nIs he come?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWhy, no, sir.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWhat then?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nHe is coming.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWhen will he be here?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWhen he stands where I am and sees you there.\n\nTRANIO.\nBut say, what to thine old news?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWhy, Petruchio is coming, in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turned; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta’en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points: his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten; near-legged before, and with a half-checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep’s leather, which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman’s crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there pieced with pack-thread.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWho comes with him?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nO, sir! his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humour of forty fancies prick’d in’t for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.\n\nTRANIO.\n’Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;\nYet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell’d.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nI am glad he’s come, howsoe’er he comes.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWhy, sir, he comes not.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nDidst thou not say he comes?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nWho? that Petruchio came?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nAy, that Petruchio came.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nNo, sir; I say his horse comes, with him on his back.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nWhy, that’s all one.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nNay, by Saint Jamy,\nI hold you a penny,\nA horse and a man\nIs more than one,\nAnd yet not many.\n\nEnter Petruchio and Grumio.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nCome, where be these gallants?

    "content":"ACT IV\nSCENE I. A hall in Petruchio’s country house.\nEnter Grumio.\n\nGRUMIO.\nFie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray’d? Was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis!\n\nEnter Curtis.\n\nCURTIS.\nWho is that calls so coldly?\n\nGRUMIO.\nA piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis.\n\nCURTIS.\nIs my master and his wife coming, Grumio?\n\nGRUMIO.\nO, ay! Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no water.\n\nCURTIS.\nIs she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?\n\nGRUMIO.\nShe was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou knowest winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tamed my old master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.\n\nCURTIS.\nAway, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.\n\nGRUMIO.\nAm I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot; and so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand,—she being now at hand,— thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?\n\nCURTIS.\nI prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?\n\nGRUMIO.\nA cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.\n\nCURTIS.\nThere’s fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.\n\nGRUMIO.\nWhy, ‘Jack boy! ho, boy!’ and as much news as wilt thou.\n\nCURTIS.\nCome, you are so full of cony-catching.\n\nGRUMIO.\nWhy, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold. Where’s the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, and carpets laid, and everything in order?\n\nCURTIS.\nAll ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.\n\nGRUMIO.\nFirst, know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fallen out.\n\nCURTIS.\nHow?\n\nGRUMIO.\nOut of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a tale.\n\nCURTIS.\nLet’s ha’t, good Grumio.\n\nGRUMIO.\nLend thine ear.\n\nCURTIS.\nHere.\n\nGRUMIO.\n[Striking him.] There.\n\nCURTIS.\nThis ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.\n\nGRUMIO.\nAnd therefore ’tis called a sensible tale; and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,—\n\nCURTIS.\nBoth of one horse?\n\nGRUMIO.\nWhat’s that to thee?\n\nCURTIS.\nWhy, a horse.\n\nGRUMIO.\nTell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled; how he left her with the horse upon her; how he beat me because her horse stumbled; how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me: how he swore; how she prayed, that never prayed before; how I cried; how the horses ran away; how her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper; with many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.\n\nCURTIS.\nBy this reckoning he is more shrew than she.\n\nGRUMIO.\nAy; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest; let their heads be sleekly combed, their blue coats brush’d and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?\n\nCURTIS.\nThey are.\n\nGRUMIO.\nCall them forth.\n\nCURTIS.\nDo you hear? ho! You must meet my master to countenance my mistress.\n\nGRUMIO.\nWhy, she hath a face of her own.\n\nCURTIS.\nWho knows not that?\n\nGRUMIO.\nThou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.\n\nCURTIS.\nI call them forth to credit her.\n\nGRUMIO.\nWhy, she comes to borrow nothing of them.\n\nEnter four or five Servants.\n\nNATHANIEL.\nWelcome home, Grumio!\n\nPHILIP.\nHow now, Grumio!\n\nJOSEPH.\nWhat, Grumio!\n\nNICHOLAS.\nFellow Grumio!\n\nNATHANIEL.\nHow now, old lad!\n\nGRUMIO.\nWelcome, you; how now, you; what, you; fellow, you; and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready, and all things neat?\n\nNATHANIEL.\nAll things is ready. How near is our master?\n\nGRUMIO.\nE’en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not,—\nCock’s passion, silence! I hear my master.\n\nEnter Petruchio and Katherina.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhere be these knaves? What! no man at door\nTo hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?\nWhere is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?—\n\nALL SERVANTS.\nHere, here, sir; here, sir.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nHere, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!\nYou logger-headed and unpolish’d grooms!\nWhat, no attendance? no regard? no duty?\nWhere is the foolish knave I sent before?\n\nGRUMIO.\nHere, sir; as foolish as I was before.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nYou peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!\nDid I not bid thee meet me in the park,\nAnd bring along these rascal knaves with thee?\n\nGRUMIO.\nNathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made,\nAnd Gabriel’s pumps were all unpink’d i’ the heel;\nThere was no link to colour Peter’s hat,\nAnd Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing;\nThere was none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;\nThe rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;\nYet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nGo, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.\n\n[Exeunt some of the Servants.]\n\nWhere is the life that late I led?\nWhere are those—? Sit down, Kate, and welcome.\nFood, food, food, food!\n\nRe-enter Servants with supper.\n\nWhy, when, I say?—Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.—\nOff with my boots, you rogues! you villains! when?\nIt was the friar of orders grey,\nAs he forth walked on his way:\nOut, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:\n\n[Strikes him.]\n\nTake that, and mend the plucking off the other.\nBe merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!\nWhere’s my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence\nAnd bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:\n\n[Exit Servant.]\n\nOne, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.\nWhere are my slippers? Shall I have some water?\nCome, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.—\n\n[Servant lets the ewer fall. Petruchio strikes him.]\n\nYou whoreson villain! will you let it fall?\n\nKATHERINA.\nPatience, I pray you; ’twas a fault unwilling.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear’d knave!\nCome, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.\nWill you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?—\nWhat’s this? Mutton?\n\nFIRST SERVANT.\nAy.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWho brought it?\n\nPETER.\nI.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\n’Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.\nWhat dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?\nHow durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,\nAnd serve it thus to me that love it not?\n\n[Throws the meat, etc., at them.]\n\nThere, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all.\nYou heedless joltheads and unmanner’d slaves!\nWhat! do you grumble? I’ll be with you straight.\n\nKATHERINA.\nI pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;\nThe meat was well, if you were so contented.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away,\nAnd I expressly am forbid to touch it;\nFor it engenders choler, planteth anger;\nAnd better ’twere that both of us did fast,\nSince, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,\nThan feed it with such over-roasted flesh.\nBe patient; tomorrow ’t shall be mended.\nAnd for this night we’ll fast for company:\nCome, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.\n\n[Exeunt Petruchio, Katherina and Curtis.]\n\nNATHANIEL.\nPeter, didst ever see the like?\n\nPETER.\nHe kills her in her own humour.\n\nRe-enter Curtis.\n\nGRUMIO.\nWhere is he?\n\nCURTIS.\nIn her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;\nAnd rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,\nKnows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,\nAnd sits as one new risen from a dream.\nAway, away! for he is coming hither.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\nRe-enter Petruchio.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nThus have I politicly begun my reign,\nAnd ’tis my hope to end successfully.\nMy falcon now is sharp and passing empty.\nAnd till she stoop she must not be full-gorg’d,\nFor then she never looks upon her lure.\nAnother way I have to man my haggard,\nTo make her come, and know her keeper’s call,\nThat is, to watch her, as we watch these kites\nThat bate and beat, and will not be obedient.\nShe eat no meat today, nor none shall eat;\nLast night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not;\nAs with the meat, some undeserved fault\nI’ll find about the making of the bed;\nAnd here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,\nThis way the coverlet, another way the sheets;\nAy, and amid this hurly I intend\nThat all is done in reverend care of her;\nAnd, in conclusion, she shall watch all night:\nAnd if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl,\nAnd with the clamour keep her still awake.\nThis is a way to kill a wife with kindness;\nAnd thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humour.\nHe that knows better how to tame a shrew,\nNow let him speak; ’tis charity to show.\n\n[Exit.]",

Why, ay: come, tailor, let us see’t.\nO mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?\nWhat’s this? A sleeve? ’Tis like a demi-cannon.\nWhat, up and down, carv’d like an apple tart?\nHere’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,\nLike to a censer in a barber’s shop.\nWhy, what i’ devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?\n\nHORTENSIO.\n[Aside] I see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown.\n\nTAILOR.\nYou bid me make it orderly and well,\nAccording to the fashion and the time.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nMarry, and did; but if you be remember’d,\nI did not bid you mar it to the time.\nGo, hop me over every kennel home,\nFor you shall hop without my custom, sir.\nI’ll none of it: hence! make your best of it.\n\nKATHERINA.\nI never saw a better fashion’d gown,\nMore quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;\nBelike you mean to make a puppet of me.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhy, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.\n\nTAILOR.\nShe says your worship means to make a puppet of her.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nO monstrous arrogance!

Thou hast braved many men; brave not me: I will neither be fac’d nor brav’d. I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.\n\nTAILOR.\nWhy, here is the note of the fashion to testify.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nRead it.\n\nGRUMIO.\nThe note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.\n\nTAILOR.\n’Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown.’\n\nGRUMIO.\nMaster, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread; I said, a gown.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nProceed.\n\nTAILOR.\n‘With a small compassed cape.’\n\nGRUMIO.\nI confess the cape.\n\nTAILOR.\n‘With a trunk sleeve.’\n\nGRUMIO.\nI confess two sleeves.\n\nTAILOR.\n‘The sleeves curiously cut.’\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nAy, there’s the villainy.\n\nGRUMIO.\nError i’ the bill, sir; error i’ the bill. I commanded the sleeves should be cut out, and sew’d up again; and that I’ll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.\n\nTAILOR.\nThis is true that I say; and I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it.\n\nGRUMIO.\nI am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nGod-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWell, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.\n\nGRUMIO.\nYou are i’ the right, sir; ’tis for my mistress.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nGo, take it up unto thy master’s use.\n\nGRUMIO.\nVillain, not for thy life!

Sirs, let ’t alone:\nI will not go today; and ere I do,\nIt shall be what o’clock I say it is.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nWhy, so this gallant will command the sun.\n\n[Exeunt.]",

Before Baptista’s house.\nEnter Tranio and the Pedant dressed like Vincentio\n\nTRANIO.\nSir, this is the house; please it you that I call?\n\nPEDANT.\nAy, what else? and, but I be deceived,\nSignior Baptista may remember me,\nNear twenty years ago in Genoa,\nWhere we were lodgers at the Pegasus.\n\nTRANIO.\n’Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,\nWith such austerity as ’longeth to a father.\n\nPEDANT.\nI warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;\n’Twere good he were school’d.\n\nEnter Biondello.\n\nTRANIO.\nFear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,\nNow do your duty throughly, I advise you.\nImagine ’twere the right Vincentio.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nTut! fear not me.\n\nTRANIO.\nBut hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nI told him that your father was at Venice,\nAnd that you look’d for him this day in Padua.\n\nTRANIO.\nTh’art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.\nHere comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.\n\nEnter Baptista and Lucentio.\n\nSignior Baptista, you are happily met.\n[To the Pedant] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;\nI pray you stand good father to me now;\nGive me Bianca for my patrimony.\n\nPEDANT.\nSoft, son!\nSir, by your leave: having come to Padua\nTo gather in some debts, my son Lucentio\nMade me acquainted with a weighty cause\nOf love between your daughter and himself:\nAnd,—for the good report I hear of you,\nAnd for the love he beareth to your daughter,\nAnd she to him,—to stay him not too long,\nI am content, in a good father’s care,\nTo have him match’d; and, if you please to like\nNo worse than I, upon some agreement\nMe shall you find ready and willing\nWith one consent to have her so bestow’d;\nFor curious I cannot be with you,\nSignior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nSir, pardon me in what I have to say.\nYour plainness and your shortness please me well.\nRight true it is your son Lucentio here\nDoth love my daughter, and she loveth him,\nOr both dissemble deeply their affections;\nAnd therefore, if you say no more than this,\nThat like a father you will deal with him,\nAnd pass my daughter a sufficient dower,\nThe match is made, and all is done:\nYour son shall have my daughter with consent.\n\nTRANIO.\nI thank you, sir. Where then do you know best\nWe be affied, and such assurance ta’en\nAs shall with either part’s agreement stand?\n\nBAPTISTA.\nNot in my house, Lucentio, for you know\nPitchers have ears, and I have many servants;\nBesides, old Gremio is hearkening still,\nAnd happily we might be interrupted.\n\nTRANIO.\nThen at my lodging, and it like you:\nThere doth my father lie; and there this night\nWe’ll pass the business privately and well.\nSend for your daughter by your servant here;\nMy boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.\nThe worst is this, that at so slender warning\nYou are like to have a thin and slender pittance.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nIt likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,\nAnd bid Bianca make her ready straight;\nAnd, if you will, tell what hath happened:\nLucentio’s father is arriv’d in Padua,\nAnd how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI pray the gods she may, with all my heart!\n\nTRANIO.\nDally not with the gods, but get thee gone.\nSignior Baptista, shall I lead the way?\nWelcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;\nCome, sir; we will better it in Pisa.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nI follow you.\n\n[Exeunt Tranio, Pedant and Baptista.]\n\nBIONDELLO.\nCambio!\n\nLUCENTIO.\nWhat say’st thou, Biondello?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nYou saw my master wink and laugh upon you?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nBiondello, what of that?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nFaith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI pray thee moralize them.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nThen thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAnd what of him?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nHis daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAnd then?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nThe old priest at Saint Luke’s church is at your command at all hours.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAnd what of all this?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nI cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum; to the church! take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.\nIf this be not that you look for, I have more to say,\nBut bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.\n\n[Going.]\n\nLUCENTIO.\nHear’st thou, Biondello?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nI cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI may, and will, if she be so contented.\nShe will be pleas’d; then wherefore should I doubt?\nHap what hap may, I’ll roundly go about her;\nIt shall go hard if Cambio go without her:\n\n[Exit.]",

Tranio, Biondello and Grumio and Others, attending.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nAt last, though long, our jarring notes agree:\nAnd time it is when raging war is done,\nTo smile at ’scapes and perils overblown.\nMy fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,\nWhile I with self-same kindness welcome thine.\nBrother Petruchio, sister Katherina,\nAnd thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,\nFeast with the best, and welcome to my house:\nMy banquet is to close our stomachs up,\nAfter our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;\nFor now we sit to chat as well as eat.\n\n[They sit at table.]\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!\n\nBAPTISTA.\nPadua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nPadua affords nothing but what is kind.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nFor both our sakes I would that word were true.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNow, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.\n\nWIDOW.\nThen never trust me if I be afeard.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nYou are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:\nI mean Hortensio is afeard of you.\n\nWIDOW.\nHe that is giddy thinks the world turns round.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nRoundly replied.\n\nKATHERINA.\nMistress, how mean you that?\n\nWIDOW.\nThus I conceive by him.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nConceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nMy widow says thus she conceives her tale.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nVery well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.\n\nKATHERINA.\n’He that is giddy thinks the world turns round’:\nI pray you tell me what you meant by that.\n\nWIDOW.\nYour husband, being troubled with a shrew,\nMeasures my husband’s sorrow by his woe;\nAnd now you know my meaning.\n\nKATHERINA.\nA very mean meaning.\n\nWIDOW.\nRight, I mean you.\n\nKATHERINA.\nAnd I am mean, indeed, respecting you.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nTo her, Kate!\n\nHORTENSIO.\nTo her, widow!\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nThat’s my office.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nSpoke like an officer: ha’ to thee, lad.\n\n[Drinks to Hortensio.]\n\nBAPTISTA.\nHow likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?\n\nGREMIO.\nBelieve me, sir, they butt together well.\n\nBIANCA.\nHead and butt! An hasty-witted body\nWould say your head and butt were head and horn.\n\nVINCENTIO.\nAy, mistress bride, hath that awaken’d you?\n\nBIANCA.\nAy, but not frighted me; therefore I’ll sleep again.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNay, that you shall not; since you have begun,\nHave at you for a bitter jest or two.\n\nBIANCA.\nAm I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,\nAnd then pursue me as you draw your bow.\nYou are welcome all.\n\n[Exeunt Bianca, Katherina and Widow.]\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nShe hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio;\nThis bird you aim’d at, though you hit her not:\nTherefore a health to all that shot and miss’d.\n\nTRANIO.\nO, sir! Lucentio slipp’d me like his greyhound,\nWhich runs himself, and catches for his master.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA good swift simile, but something currish.\n\nTRANIO.\n’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:\n’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nO ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nConfess, confess; hath he not hit you here?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA has a little gall’d me, I confess;\nAnd as the jest did glance away from me,\n’Tis ten to one it maim’d you two outright.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nNow, in good sadness, son Petruchio,\nI think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWell, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,\nLet’s each one send unto his wife,\nAnd he whose wife is most obedient,\nTo come at first when he doth send for her,\nShall win the wager which we will propose.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nContent. What’s the wager?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nTwenty crowns.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nTwenty crowns!\nI’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound,\nBut twenty times so much upon my wife.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nA hundred then.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nContent.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nA match! ’tis done.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nWho shall begin?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nThat will I.\nGo, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.\n\nBIONDELLO.\nI go.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nBAPTISTA.\nSon, I’ll be your half, Bianca comes.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI’ll have no halves; I’ll bear it all myself.\n\nRe-enter Biondello.\n\nHow now! what news?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nSir, my mistress sends you word\nThat she is busy and she cannot come.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nHow! She’s busy, and she cannot come!\nIs that an answer?\n\nGREMIO.\nAy, and a kind one too:\nPray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI hope better.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nSirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife\nTo come to me forthwith.\n\n[Exit Biondello.]\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nO, ho! entreat her!\nNay, then she must needs come.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nI am afraid, sir,\nDo what you can, yours will not be entreated.\n\nRe-enter Biondello.\n\nNow, where’s my wife?\n\nBIONDELLO.\nShe says you have some goodly jest in hand:\nShe will not come; she bids you come to her.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWorse and worse; she will not come! O vile,\nIntolerable, not to be endur’d!\nSirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,\nSay I command her come to me.\n\n[Exit Grumio.]\n\nHORTENSIO.\nI know her answer.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhat?\n\nHORTENSIO.\nShe will not.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nThe fouler fortune mine, and there an end.\n\nRe-enter Katherina.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nNow, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!\n\nKATHERINA.\nWhat is your will sir, that you send for me?\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhere is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?\n\nKATHERINA.\nThey sit conferring by the parlour fire.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nGo fetch them hither; if they deny to come,\nSwinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.\nAway, I say, and bring them hither straight.\n\n[Exit Katherina.]\n\nLUCENTIO.\nHere is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.\n\nHORTENSIO.\nAnd so it is. I wonder what it bodes.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nMarry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,\nAn awful rule, and right supremacy;\nAnd, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy.\n\nBAPTISTA.\nNow fair befall thee, good Petruchio!\nThe wager thou hast won; and I will add\nUnto their losses twenty thousand crowns;\nAnother dowry to another daughter,\nFor she is chang’d, as she had never been.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nNay, I will win my wager better yet,\nAnd show more sign of her obedience,\nHer new-built virtue and obedience.\nSee where she comes, and brings your froward wives\nAs prisoners to her womanly persuasion.\n\nRe-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow.\n\nKatherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:\nOff with that bauble, throw it underfoot.\n\n[Katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down.]\n\nWIDOW.\nLord, let me never have a cause to sigh\nTill I be brought to such a silly pass!\n\nBIANCA.\nFie! what a foolish duty call you this?\n\nLUCENTIO.\nI would your duty were as foolish too;\nThe wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,\nHath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!\n\nBIANCA.\nThe more fool you for laying on my duty.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nKatherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women\nWhat duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\n\nWIDOW.\nCome, come, you’re mocking; we will have no telling.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nCome on, I say; and first begin with her.\n\nWIDOW.\nShe shall not.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nI say she shall: and first begin with her.\n\nKATHERINA.\nFie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,\nAnd dart not scornful glances from those eyes\nTo wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:\nIt blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,\nConfounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,\nAnd in no sense is meet or amiable.\nA woman mov’d is like a fountain troubled,\nMuddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;\nAnd while it is so, none so dry or thirsty\nWill deign to sip or touch one drop of it.\nThy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,\nThy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,\nAnd for thy maintenance commits his body\nTo painful labour both by sea and land,\nTo watch the night in storms, the day in cold,\nWhilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;\nAnd craves no other tribute at thy hands\nBut love, fair looks, and true obedience;\nToo little payment for so great a debt.\nSuch duty as the subject owes the prince,\nEven such a woman oweth to her husband;\nAnd when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,\nAnd not obedient to his honest will,\nWhat is she but a foul contending rebel\nAnd graceless traitor to her loving lord?—\nI am asham’d that women are so simple\nTo offer war where they should kneel for peace,\nOr seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,\nWhen they are bound to serve, love, and obey.\nWhy are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,\nUnapt to toil and trouble in the world,\nBut that our soft conditions and our hearts\nShould well agree with our external parts?\nCome, come, you froward and unable worms!\nMy mind hath been as big as one of yours,\nMy heart as great, my reason haply more,\nTo bandy word for word and frown for frown;\nBut now I see our lances are but straws,\nOur strength as weak, our weakness past compare,\nThat seeming to be most which we indeed least are.\nThen vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,\nAnd place your hands below your husband’s foot:\nIn token of which duty, if he please,\nMy hand is ready; may it do him ease.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nWhy, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nWell, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha’t.\n\nVINCENTIO.\n’Tis a good hearing when children are toward.\n\nLUCENTIO.\nBut a harsh hearing when women are froward.\n\nPETRUCHIO.\nCome, Kate, we’ll to bed.\nWe three are married, but you two are sped.\n’Twas I won the wager,\n[To Lucentio.] though you hit the white;\nAnd being a winner, God give you good night!\n\n[Exeunt Petruchio and Katherina.]\n\nHORTENSIO.\nNow go thy ways; thou hast tam’d a curst shrew.\n\nLUCENTIO.\n’Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam’d so.\n\n[Exeunt.]",
