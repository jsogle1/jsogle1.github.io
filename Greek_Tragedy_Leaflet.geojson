    "content":"AGAMEMNON\nCHARACTERS IN THE PLAY\nAGAMEMNON, son of Atreus and King of Argos and Mycenae; Commander-in-Chief of the Greek armies in the War against Troy.\nCLYTEMNESTRA, daughter of Tyndareus, sister of Helen; wife to Agamemnon.\nAIGISTHOS, son of Thyestes, cousin and blood-enemy to Agamemnon, lover to Clytemnestra.\nCASSANDRA, daughter of Priam, King of Troy, a prophetess; now slave to Agamemnon.\nA WATCHMAN.\nA HERALD.\nCHORUS of Argive Elders, faithful to AGAMEMNON.\nCHARACTERS MENTIONED IN THE PLAY\nMENELÂÜS, brother to Agamemnon, husband of Helen, and King of Sparta.\nThe two sons of Atreus are called the Atreidae.\nHELEN, most beautiful of women; daughter of Tyndareus, wife to MENELÂÜS; beloved and carried off by Paris.\nPARIS, son of Priam, King of Troy, lover of Helen.\nAlso called ALEXANDER.\nPRIAM, the aged King of Troy.\nThe Greeks are also referred to as Achaians, Argives, Danaans; Troy is also called Ilion.\nThe play was produced in the archonship of Philocles (458 B.C.). The first prize was won by Aeschylus with the “Agamemnon”, “Libation-Bearers”, “Eumenides”, and the Satyr Play “Proteus”.\nTHE AGAMEMNON\nThe Scene represents a space in front of the Palace of Agamemnon in Argos, with an Altar of Zeus in the centre and many other altars at the sides. On a high terrace of the roof stands a WATCHMAN. It is night.\nWATCHMAN.\nThis waste of year-long vigil I have prayed\nGod for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,\nAs sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae’s hall,\nTill well I know yon midnight festival\nOf swarming stars, and them that lonely go,\nBearers to man of summer and of snow,\nGreat lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.\nAnd still I await the sign, the beacon pyre\nThat bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame\nShouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim\nCleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passioned!\nAnd when I turn me to my bed—my bed\nDew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near\nCometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear\nBreathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain\nTo close may close too well to wake again;\nThink I perchance to sing or troll a tune\nFor medicine against sleep, the music soon\nChanges to sighing for the tale untold\nOf this house, not well mastered as of old.\nHowbeit, may God yet send us rest, and light\nThe flame of good news flashed across the night.\n[He is silent, watching. Suddenly at a distance in the night there is a glimmer of fire, increasing presently to a blaze.]\nHa!\nO kindler of the dark, O daylight birth\nOf dawn and dancing upon Argive earth\nFor this great end! All hail!—What ho, within!\nWhat ho! Bear word to Agamemnon’s queen\nTo rise, like dawn, and lift in answer strong\nTo this glad lamp her women’s triumph-song,\nIf verily, verily, Ilion’s citadel\nIs fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.\nAnd I myself will tread the dance before\nAll others; for my master’s dice I score\nGood, and mine own to-night three sixes plain.\n[Lights begin to show in the Palace.]\nOh, good or ill, my hand shall clasp again\nMy dear lord’s hand, returning! Beyond that\nI speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight\nAcross my tongue. But these stone walls know well,\nIf stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell.\nFor me, to him that knoweth I can yet\nSpeak; if another questions I forget.\n[Exit into the Palace. The women’s “Ololûgê” or triumph-cry, is heard within and then repeated again and again further off in the City. Handmaids and Attendants come from the Palace, bearing torches, with which they kindle incense on the altars. Among them comes CLYTEMNESTRA, who throws herself on her knees at the central Altar in an agony of prayer.]\n[Presently from the further side of the open space appear the CHORUS of ELDERS and move gradually into position in front of the Palace. The day begins to dawn.]\nCHORUS.\nTen years since Ilion’s righteous foes,\nThe Atreidae strong,\nMenelaüs and eke Agamemnon arose,\nTwo thrones, two sceptres, yoked of God;\nAnd a thousand galleys of Argos trod\nThe seas for the righting of wrong;\nAnd wrath of battle about them cried,\nAs vultures cry,\nWhose nest is plundered, and up they fly\nIn anguish lonely, eddying wide,\nGreat wings like oars in the waste of sky,\nTheir task gone from them, no more to keep\nWatch o’er the vulture babes asleep.\nBut One there is who heareth on high\nSome Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo—\nThat keen bird-throated suffering cry\nOf the stranger wronged in God’s own sky;\nAnd sendeth down, for the law transgressed,\nThe Wrath of the Feet that follow.\nSo Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend,\nZeus who Prevaileth, in after quest\nFor One Belovèd by Many Men\nOn Paris sent the Atreidae twain;\nYea, sent him dances before the end\nFor his bridal cheer,\nWrestlings heavy and limbs forespent\nFor Greek and Trojan, the knee earth-bent,\nThe bloody dust and the broken spear.\nHe knoweth, that which is here is here,\nAnd that which Shall Be followeth near;\nHe seeketh God with a great desire,\nHe heaps his gifts, he essays his pyre\nWith torch below and with oil above,\nWith tears, but never the wrath shall move\nOf the Altar cold that rejects his fire.\nWe saw the Avengers go that day,\nAnd they left us here; for our flesh is old\nAnd serveth not; and these staves uphold\nA strength like the strength of a child at play.\nFor the sap that springs in the young man’s hand\nAnd the valour of age, they have left the land.\nAnd the passing old, while the dead leaf blows\nAnd the old staff gropeth his three-foot way,\nWeak as a babe and alone he goes,\nA dream left wandering in the day.\n[Coming near the Central Altar they see CLYTEMNESTRA, who is still rapt in prayer.]\nBut thou, O daughter of Tyndareus,\nQueen Clytemnestra, what need? What news?\nWhat tale or tiding hath stirred thy mood\nTo send forth word upon all our ways\nFor incensed worship? Of every god\nThat guards the city, the deep, the high,\nGods of the mart, gods of the sky,\nThe altars blaze.\nOne here, one there,\nTo the skyey night the firebrands flare,\nDrunk with the soft and guileless spell\nOf balm of kings from the inmost cell.\nTell, O Queen, and reject us not,\nAll that can or that may be told,\nAnd healer be to this aching thought,\nWhich one time hovereth, evil-cold,\nAnd then from the fires thou kindlest\nWill Hope be kindled, and hungry Care\nFall back for a little while, nor tear\nThe heart that beateth below my breast.\n[CLYTEMNESTRA rises silently, as though unconscious of their presence, and goes into the House. The CHORUS take position and begin their first Stasimon, or Standing-song,]\nCHORUS.\n(The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young.)\nIt is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way given,\nTo men more strong,\n(For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven\nA spell, a Strength of Song:)\nHow the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided\nAbove all Greeks that are,\nWith avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided\nBy the Bird of War.\n’Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,\nOne Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,\nBy the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;\nAnd they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,\nYea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew.\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future.)\nAnd the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke\nTwain-tempered, knew\nThose fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,\nReading the omen true.\n“At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,\nYea, and before the wall\nViolent division the fulness of land and town\nShall waste withal;\nIf only God’s eye gloom not against our gates,\nAnd the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail.\nFor Pity lives, and those wingèd Hounds she hates,\nWhich tore in the Trembler’s body the unborn beast.\nAnd Artemis abhorreth the eagles’ feast.”\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her back.)\n“Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover\nOf the dewy breath of the Lion’s child;\nThou the delight, through den and cover,\nOf the young life at the breast of the wild,\nYet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles’ Kill!\nBe the vision accepted, albeit horrible….\nBut I-ê, I-ê! Stay her, O Paian, stay!\nFor lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,\nLong wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,\nOn, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:\nThey kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;\nStrife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,\nAnd beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken—\nIt plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth—\nWrath for a child to be.”\nSo Calchas, reading the wayside eagles’ sign,\nSpake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;\nAnd like his song be thine,\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace. I turn to Zeus, who has shown man how to Learn by Suffering.)\nZeus! Zeus, whate’er He be,\nIf this name He love to hear\nThis He shall be called of me.\nSearching earth and sea and air\nRefuge nowhere can I find\nSave Him only, if my mind\nWill cast off before it die\nThe burden of this vanity.\nOne there was who reigned of old,\nBig with wrath to brave and blast,\nLo, his name is no more told!\nAnd who followed met at last\nHis Third-thrower, and is gone.\nOnly they whose hearts have known\nZeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,\nThey shall win their vision’s end;\nZeus the Guide, who made man turn\nThought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain\nMan by Suffering shall Learn.\nSo the heart of him, again\nAching with remembered pain,\nBleeds and sleepeth not, until\nWisdom comes against his will.\n’Tis the gift of One by strife\nLifted to the throne of life.\n(AGAMEMNON accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the fleet lay at Aulis.)\nSo that day the Elder Lord,\nMarshal of the Achaian ships,\nStrove not with the prophet’s word,\nBowed him to his fate’s eclipse,\nWhen with empty jars and lips\nParched and seas impassable\nFate on that Greek army fell,\nFronting Chalcis as it lay,\nBy Aulis in the swirling bay.\n(Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the death of AGAMEMNON’S daughter. The King’s doubt and grief.)\nAnd winds, winds blew from Strymon River,\nUnharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,\nMan-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,\nAnd the waste of days was made long, more long,\nTill the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;\nThen through the storm rose the War-seer’s song,\nAnd told of medicine that should tame the tempest,\nBut bow the Princes to a direr wrong.\nThen “Artemis” he whispered, he named the name;\nAnd the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,\nAnd smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.\nBut the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:\n“A heavy doom, sure, if God’s will were broken;\nBut to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,\nIs that not heavy? That her blood should flow\nOn her father’s hand, hard beside an altar?\nMy path is sorrow wheresoe’er I go.\nShall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,\nAnd the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow?\nThey cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,\nFor a Virgin’s blood: ’tis a rite of old, men tell.\nAnd they burn with longing.—O God may the end be well!”\n(But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice.)\nTo the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,\nAnd a strange wind within his bosom tossed,\nA wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;\nAnd he rose up, daring to the uttermost.\nFor men are boldened by a Blindness, straying\nToward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,\nYea, and itself is grief;\nSo this man hardened to his own child’s slaying,\nAs help to avenge him for a woman’s laughter\nAnd bring his ships relief!\nHer “Father, Father,” her sad cry that lingered,\nHer virgin heart’s breath they held all as naught,\nThose bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;\nAnd there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought\nHe charged the young men to uplift and bind her,\nAs ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,\nFierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore\nTo the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder\nThe sweet mouth’s utterance, the cries that falter,\n—His curse for evermore!—\nWith violence and a curb’s voiceless wrath.\nHer stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,\nAnd her eye with an arrow of pity found its path\nTo each man’s heart that slew:\nA face in a picture, striving amazedly;\nThe little maid who danced at her father’s board,\nThe innocent voice man’s love came never nigh,\nWho joined to his her little paean-cry\nWhen the third cup was poured….\nWhat came thereafter I saw not neither tell.\nBut the craft of Calchas failed not.—’Tis written, He\nWho Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well.\nAnd that which is to be,\nYe will know at last; why weep before the hour?\nFor come it shall, as out of darkness dawn.\nOnly may good from all this evil flower;\nSo prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower\nGuarding the land alone.\n[As they cease, CLYTEMNESTRA comes from the Palace with Attendants. She has finished her prayer and sacrifice, and is now wrought up to face the meeting with her husband. The Leader approaches her.]\nLEADER.\nBefore thy state, O Queen, I bow mine eyes.\n’Tis written, when the man’s throne empty lies,\nThe woman shall be honoured.—Hast thou heard\nSome tiding sure? Or is it Hope, hath stirred\nTo fire these altars? Dearly though we seek\nTo learn, ’tis thine to speak or not to speak.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nGlad-voiced, the old saw telleth, comes this morn,\nThe Star-child of a dancing midnight born,\nAnd beareth to thine ear a word of joy\nBeyond all hope: the Greek hath taken Troy.\nLEADER.\nHow?\nThy word flies past me, being incredible.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nIlion is ours. No riddling tale I tell.\nLEADER.\nSuch joy comes knocking at the gate of tears.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, ’tis a faithful heart that eye declares.\nLEADER.\nWhat warrant hast thou? Is there proof of this?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThere is; unless a God hath lied there is.\nLEADER.\nSome dream-shape came to thee in speaking guise?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWho deemeth me a dupe of drowsing eyes?\nLEADER.\nSome word within that hovereth without wings?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAm I a child to hearken to such things?\nLEADER.\nTroy fallen?—But how long? When fell she, say?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThe very night that mothered this new day.\nLEADER.\nAnd who of heralds with such fury came?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nA Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame.\nWhence starting, beacon after beacon burst\nIn flaming message hitherward. Ida first\nTold Hermes’ Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign\nWas caught by towering Athos, the divine,\nWith pines immense—yea, fishes of the night\nSwam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,\nWhich swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far\nMakistos’ watchmen marked a glimmering star;\nThey, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,\nSpring up to hurl the fiery message on,\nAnd a far light beyond the Eurîpus tells\nThat word hath reached Messapion’s sentinels.\nThey beaconed back, then onward with a high\nHeap of dead heather flaming to the sky.\nAnd onward still, not failing nor aswoon,\nAcross the Asôpus like a beaming moon\nThe great word leapt, and on Kithairon’s height\nUproused a new relay of racing light.\nHis watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid\nTheir welcome, burning higher than was bid.\nOut over Lake Gorgôpis then it floats,\nTo Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,\nCrying for “Fire, more Fire!” And fire was reared,\nStintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,\nThat waved in flame beyond the promontory\nRock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,\nKindling the night: then one short swoop to catch\nThe Spider’s Crag, our city’s tower of watch;\nWhence hither to the Atreidae’s roof it came,\nA light true-fathered of Idaean flame.\nTorch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold\nThe tale thereof in stations manifold,\nEach one by each made perfect ere it passed,\nAnd Victory in the first as in the last.\nThese be my proofs and tokens that my lord\nFrom Troy hath spoke to me a burning word.\nLEADER.\nWoman, speak on. Hereafter shall my prayer\nBe raised to God; now let me only hear,\nAgain and full, the marvel and the joy.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNow, even now, the Achaian holdeth Troy!\nMethinks there is a crying in her streets\nThat makes no concord. When sweet unguent meets\nWith vinegar in one phial, I warrant none\nShall lay those wranglers lovingly at one.\nSo conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,\nTwo sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear.\nHere women in the dust about their slain,\nHusbands or brethren, and by dead old men\nPale children who shall never more be free,\nFor all they loved on earth cry desolately.\nAnd hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark\nBattle and then long searching through the dark\nHath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast\nAt last on all the plenty Troy possessed,\nNo portion in that feast nor ordinance,\nBut each man clutching at the prize of chance.\nAye, there at last under good roofs they lie\nOf men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,\nNo watches more, no bitter moony dew….\nHow blessèd they will sleep the whole night through!\nOh, if these days they keep them free from sin\nToward Ilion’s conquered shrines and Them within\nWho watch unconquered, maybe not again\nThe smiter shall be smit, the taker ta’en.\nMay God but grant there fall not on that host\nThe greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust\nTo spoil inviolate things! But half the race\nIs run which windeth back to home and peace.\nYea, though of God they pass unchallengèd,\nMethinks the wound of all those desolate dead\nMight waken, groping for its will….\nYe hear\nA woman’s word, belike a woman’s fear.\nMay good but conquer in the last incline\nOf the balance! Of all prayers that prayer is mine.\nLEADER.\nO Woman, like a man faithful and wise\nThou speakest. I accept thy testimonies\nAnd turn to God with praising, for a gain\nIs won this day that pays for all our pain.\n[CLYTEMNESTRA returns to the Palace. The CHORUS take up their position for the Second Stasimon.]\nAN ELDER.\nO Zeus, All-ruler, and Night the Aid,\nGainer of glories, and hast thou thrown\nOver the towers of Ilion\nThy net close-laid,\nThat none so nimble and none so tall\nShall escape withal\nThe snare of the slaver that claspeth all?\nANOTHER.\nAnd Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend\nI also praise, who hath wrought this end.\nLong since on Paris his shaft he drew,\nAnd hath aimèd true,\nNot too soon falling nor yet too far,\nThe fire of the avenging star.\nCHORUS.\n(This is God’s judgement upon Troy. May it not be too fierce! Gold cannot save one who spurneth Justice.)\nThe stroke of Zeus hath found them! Clear this day\nThe tale, and plain to trace.\nHe judged, and Troy hath fallen.—And have men said\nThat God not deigns to mark man’s hardihead,\nTrampling to earth the grace\nOf holy and delicate things?—Sin lies that way.\nFor visibly Pride doth breed its own return\nOn prideful men, who, when their houses swell\nWith happy wealth, breathe ever wrath and blood.\nYet not too fierce let the due vengeance burn;\nOnly as deemeth well\nOne wise of mood.\nNever shall state nor gold\nShelter his heart from aching\nWhoso the Altar of Justice old\nSpurneth to Night unwaking.\n(The Sinner suffers in his longing till at last Temptation overcomes him; as longing for Helen overcame Paris.)\nThe tempting of misery forceth him, the dread\nChild of fore-scheming Woe!\nAnd help is vain; the fell desire within\nIs veilèd not, but shineth bright like Sin:\nAnd as false gold will show\nBlack where the touchstone trieth, so doth fade\nHis honour in God’s ordeal. Like a child,\nForgetting all, he hath chased his wingèd bird,\nAnd planted amid his people a sharp thorn.\nAnd no God hears his prayer, or, have they heard,\nThe man so base-beguiled\nThey cast to scorn.\nParis to Argos came;\nLove of a woman led him;\nSo God’s altar he brought to shame,\nRobbing the hand that fed him.\n(Helen’s flight; the visions seen by the King’s seers; the phantom of Helen and the King’s grief.)\nShe hath left among her people a noise of shield and sword,\nA tramp of men armed where the long ships are moored;\nShe hath ta’en in her goings Desolation as a dower;\nShe hath stept, stept quickly, through the great gated Tower,\nAnd the thing that could not be, it hath been!\nAnd the Seers they saw visions, and they spoke of strange ill:\n“A Palace, a Palace; and a great King thereof:\nA bed, a bed empty, that was once pressed in love:\nAnd thou, thou, what art thou? Let us be, thou so still,\nBeyond wrath, beyond beseeching, to the lips reft of thee!”\nFor she whom he desireth is beyond the deep sea,\nAnd a ghost in his castle shall be queen.\nImages in sweet guise\nCarven shall move him never,\nWhere is Love amid empty eyes?\nGone, gone for ever!\n(His dreams and his suffering; but the War that he made caused greater and wider suffering.)\nBut a shape that is a dream, ’mid the phantoms of the night,\nCometh near, full of tears, bringing vain vain delight:\nFor in vain when, desiring, he can feel the joy’s breath\n—Nevermore! Nevermore!—from his arms it vanisheth,\nOn wings down the pathways of sleep.\nIn the mid castle hall, on the hearthstone of the Kings,\nThese griefs there be, and griefs passing these,\nBut in each man’s dwelling of the host that sailed the seas,\nA sad woman waits; she has thoughts of many things,\nAnd patience in her heart lieth deep.\nKnoweth she them she sent,\nKnoweth she? Lo, returning,\nComes in stead of the man that went\nArmour and dust of burning.\n(The return of the funeral urns; the murmurs of the People.)\nAnd the gold-changer, Ares, who changeth quick for dead,\nWho poiseth his scale in the striving of the spears,\nBack from Troy sendeth dust, heavy dust, wet with tears,\nSendeth ashes with men’s names in his urns neatly spread.\nAnd they weep over the men, and they praise them one by one,\nHow this was a wise fighter, and this nobly-slain—\n“Fighting to win back another’s wife!”\nTill a murmur is begun,\nAnd there steals an angry pain\nAgainst Kings too forward in the strife.\nThere by Ilion’s gate\nMany a soldier sleepeth,\nYoung men beautiful; fast in hate\nTroy her conqueror keepeth.\n(For the Shedder of Blood is in great peril, and not unmarked by God. May I never be a Sacker of Cities!)\nBut the rumour of the People, it is heavy, it is chill;\nAnd tho’ no curse be spoken, like a curse doth it brood;\nAnd my heart waits some tiding which the dark holdeth still,\nFor of God not unmarked is the shedder of much blood.\nAnd who conquers beyond right … Lo, the life of man decays;\nThere be Watchers dim his light in the wasting of the years;\nHe falls, he is forgotten, and hope dies.\nThere is peril in the praise\nOver-praised that he hears;\nFor the thunder it is hurled from God’s eyes.\nGlory that breedeth strife,\nPride of the Sacker of Cities;\nYea, and the conquered captive’s life,\nSpare me, O God of Pities!\nDIVERS ELDERS.\n—The fire of good tidings it hath sped the city through,\nBut who knows if a god mocketh? Or who knows if all be true?\n’Twere the fashion of a child,\nOr a brain dream-beguiled,\nTo be kindled by the first\nTorch’s message as it burst,\nAnd thereafter, as it dies, to die too.\n—’Tis like a woman’s sceptre, to ordain\nWelcome to joy before the end is plain!\n—Too lightly opened are a woman’s ears;\nHer fence downtrod by many trespassers,\nAnd quickly crossed; but quickly lost\nThe burden of a woman’s hopes or fears.\n[Here a break occurs in the action, like the descent of the curtain in a modern theatre. A space of some days is assumed to have passed and we find the Elders again assembled.]\nLEADER.\nSoon surely shall we read the message right;\nWere fire and beacon-call and lamps of light\nTrue speakers, or but happy lights, that seem\nAnd are not, like sweet voices in a dream.\nI see a Herald yonder by the shore,\nShadowed with olive sprays. And from his sore\nRent raiment cries a witness from afar,\nDry Dust, born brother to the Mire of war,\nThat mute he comes not, neither through the smoke\nOf mountain forests shall his tale be spoke;\nBut either shouting for a joyful day,\nOr else…. But other thoughts I cast away.\nAs good hath dawned, may good shine on, we pray!\n—And whoso for this City prayeth aught\nElse, let him reap the harvest of his thought!\n[Enter the HERALD, running. His garments are torn and war-stained. He falls upon his knees and kisses the Earth, and salutes each Altar in turn.]\nHERALD.\nLand of my fathers! Argos! Am I here …\nHome, home at this tenth shining of the year,\nAnd all Hope’s anchors broken save this one!\nFor scarcely dared I dream, here in mine own\nArgos at last to fold me to my rest….\nBut now—All Hail, O Earth! O Sunlight blest!\nAnd Zeus Most High!\n[Checking himself as he sees the altar of Apollo.]\nAnd thou, O Pythian Lord;\nNo more on us be thy swift arrows poured!\nBeside Scamander well we learned how true\nThy hate is. Oh, as thou art Healer too,\nHeal us! As thou art Saviour of the Lost,\nSave also us, Apollo, being so tossed\nWith tempest! … All ye Daemons of the Pale!\nAnd Hermes! Hermes, mine own guardian, hail!\nHerald beloved, to whom all heralds bow….\nYe Blessèd Dead that sent us, receive now\nIn love your children whom the spear hath spared.\nO House of Kings, O roof-tree thrice-endeared,\nO solemn thrones! O gods that face the sun!\nNow, now, if ever in the days foregone,\nAfter these many years, with eyes that burn,\nGive hail and glory to your King’s return!\nFor Agamemnon cometh! A great light\nCometh to men and gods out of the night.\nGrand greeting give him—aye, it need be grand—\nWho, God’s avenging mattock in his hand,\nHath wrecked Troy’s towers and digged her soil beneath,\nTill her gods’ houses, they are things of death;\nHer altars waste, and blasted every seed\nWhence life might rise! So perfect is his deed,\nSo dire the yoke on Ilion he hath cast,\nThe first Atreides, King of Kings at last,\nAnd happy among men! To whom we give\nHonour most high above all things that live.\nFor Paris nor his guilty land can score\nThe deed they wrought above the pain they bore.\n“Spoiler and thief,” he heard God’s judgement pass;\nWhereby he lost his plunder, and like grass\nMowed down his father’s house and all his land;\nAnd Troy pays twofold for the sin she planned.\nLEADER.\nBe glad, thou Herald of the Greek from Troy!\nHERALD.\nSo glad, I am ready, if God will, to die!\nLEADER.\nDid love of this land work thee such distress?\nHERALD.\nThe tears stand in mine eyes for happiness.\nLEADER.\nSweet sorrow was it, then, that on you fell.\nHERALD.\nHow sweet? I cannot read thy parable.\nLEADER.\nTo pine again for them that loved you true.\nHERALD.\nDid ye then pine for us, as we for you?\nLEADER.\nThe whole land’s heart was dark, and groaned for thee.\nHERALD.\nDark? For what cause? Why should such darkness be?\nLEADER.\nSilence in wrong is our best medicine here.\nHERALD.\nYour kings were gone. What others need you fear?\nLEADER.\n’Tis past! Like thee now, I could gladly die.\nHERALD.\nEven so! ’Tis past, and all is victory.\nAnd, for our life in those long years, there were\nDoubtless some grievous days, and some were fair.\nWho but a god goes woundless all his way?….\nOh, could I tell the sick toil of the day,\nThe evil nights, scant decks ill-blanketed;\nThe rage and cursing when our daily bread\nCame not! And then on land ’twas worse than all.\nOur quarters close beneath the enemy’s wall;\nAnd rain—and from the ground the river dew—\nWet, always wet! Into our clothes it grew,\nPlague-like, and bred foul beasts in every hair.\nWould I could tell how ghastly midwinter\nStole down from Ida till the birds dropped dead!\nOr the still heat, when on his noonday bed\nThe breathless blue sea sank without a wave!….\nWhy think of it? They are past and in the grave,\nAll those long troubles. For I think the slain\nCare little if they sleep or rise again;\nAnd we, the living, wherefore should we ache\nWith counting all our lost ones, till we wake\nThe old malignant fortunes? If Good-bye\nComes from their side, Why, let them go, say I.\nSurely for us, who live, good doth prevail\nUnchallenged, with no wavering of the scale;\nWherefore we vaunt unto these shining skies,\nAs wide o’er sea and land our glory flies:\n“By men of Argolis who conquered Troy,\nThese spoils, a memory and an ancient joy,\nAre nailed in the gods’ houses throughout Greece.”\nWhich whoso readeth shall with praise increase\nOur land, our kings, and God’s grace manifold\nWhich made these marvels be.—My tale is told.\nLEADER.\nIndeed thou conquerest me. Men say, the light\nIn old men’s eyes yet serves to learn aright.\nBut Clytemnestra and the House should hear\nThese tidings first, though I their health may share.\n[During the last words CLYTEMNESTRA has entered from the Palace.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nLong since I lifted up my voice in joy,\nWhen the first messenger from flaming Troy\nSpake through the dark of sack and overthrow.\nAnd mockers chid me: “Because beacons show\nOn the hills, must Troy be fallen? Quickly born\nAre women’s hopes!” Aye, many did me scorn;\nYet gave I sacrifice; and by my word\nThrough all the city our woman’s cry was heard,\nLifted in blessing round the seats of God,\nAnd slumbrous incense o’er the altars glowed\nIn fragrance.\nAnd for thee, what need to tell\nThy further tale? My lord himself shall well\nInstruct me. Yet, to give my lord and king\nAll reverent greeting at his homecoming—\nWhat dearer dawn on woman’s eyes can flame\nThan this, which casteth wide her gate to acclaim\nThe husband whom God leadeth safe from war?—\nGo, bear my lord this prayer: That fast and far\nHe haste him to this town which loves his name;\nAnd in his castle may he find the same\nWife that he left, a watchdog of the hall,\nTrue to one voice and fierce to others all;\nA body and soul unchanged, no seal of his\nBroke in the waiting years.—No thought of ease\nNor joy from other men hath touched my soul,\nNor shall touch, until bronze be dyed like wool.\nA boast so faithful and so plain, I wot,\nSpoke by a royal Queen doth shame her not.\n[Exit CLYTEMNESTRA.]\nLEADER.\nLet thine ear mark her message. ’Tis of fair\nSeeming, and craves a clear interpreter….\nBut, Herald, I would ask thee; tell me true\nOf Menelaüs. Shall he come with you,\nOur land’s belovèd crown, untouched of ill?\nHERALD.\nI know not how to speak false words of weal\nFor friends to reap thereof a harvest true.\nLEADER.\nCanst speak of truth with comfort joined? Those two\nOnce parted, ’tis a gulf not lightly crossed.\nHERALD.\nYour king is vanished from the Achaian host,\nHe and his ship! Such comfort have I brought.\nLEADER.\nSailed he alone from Troy? Or was he caught\nBy storms in the midst of you, and swept away?\nHERALD.\nThou hast hit the truth; good marksman, as men say!\nAnd long to suffer is but brief to tell.\nLEADER.\nHow ran the sailors’ talk? Did there prevail\nOne rumour, showing him alive or dead?\nHERALD.\nNone knoweth, none hath tiding, save the head\nOf Helios, ward and watcher of the world.\nLEADER.\nThen tell us of the storm. How, when God hurled\nHis anger, did it rise? How did it die?\nHERALD.\nIt likes me not, a day of presage high\nWith dolorous tongue to stain. Those twain, I vow,\nStand best apart. When one with shuddering brow,\nFrom armies lost, back beareth to his home\nWord that the terror of her prayers is come;\nOne wound in her great heart, and many a fate\nFor many a home of men cast out to sate\nThe two-fold scourge that worketh Ares’ lust,\nSpear crossed with spear, dust wed with bloody dust;\nWho walketh laden with such weight of wrong,\nWhy, let him, if he will, uplift the song\nThat is Hell’s triumph. But to come as I\nAm now come, laden with deliverance high,\nHome to a land of peace and laughing eyes,\nAnd mar all with that fury of the skies\nWhich made our Greeks curse God—how should this be?\nTwo enemies most ancient, Fire and Sea,\nA sudden friendship swore, and proved their plight\nBy war on us poor sailors through that night\nOf misery, when the horror of the wave\nTowered over us, and winds from Strymon drave\nHull against hull, till good ships, by the horn\nOf the mad whirlwind gored and overborne,\nOne here, one there, ’mid rain and blinding spray,\nLike sheep by a devil herded, passed away.\nAnd when the blessèd Sun upraised his head,\nWe saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead,\nDead men, dead ships, and spars disasterful.\nHowbeit for us, our one unwounded hull\nOut of that wrath was stolen or begged free\nBy some good spirit—sure no man was he!—\nWho guided clear our helm; and on till now\nHath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow.\nNo surge to mar our mooring, and no floor\nOf rock to tear us when we made for shore.\nTill, fled from that sea-hell, with the clear sun\nAbove us and all trust in fortune gone,\nWe drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts\nOf that lost army, broken and scourged with knouts\nOf evil. And, methinks, if there is breath\nIn them, they talk of us as gone to death—\nHow else?—and so say we of them! For thee,\nSince Menelaüs thy first care must be,\nIf by some word of Zeus, who wills not yet\nTo leave the old house for ever desolate,\nSome ray of sunlight on a far-off sea\nLights him, yet green and living … we may see\nHis ship some day in the harbour!—’Twas the word\nOf truth ye asked me for, and truth ye have heard!\n[Exit HERALD. The CHORUS take position for the Third Stasimon.]\nCHORUS.\n(Surely there was mystic meaning in the name HELENA, meaning which was fulfilled when she fled to Troy.)\nWho was He who found for thee\nThat name, truthful utterly—\nWas it One beyond our vision\nMoving sure in pre-decision\nOf man’s doom his mystic lips?—\nCalling thee, the Battle-wed,\nThee, the Strife-encompassèd,\nHELEN? Yea, in fate’s derision,\nHell in cities, Hell in ships,\nHell in hearts of men they knew her,\nWhen the dim and delicate fold\nOf her curtains backward rolled,\nAnd to sea, to sea, she threw her\nIn the West Wind’s giant hold;\nAnd with spear and sword behind her\nCame the hunters in a flood,\nDown the oarblade’s viewless trail\nTracking, till in Simoïs’ vale\nThrough the leaves they crept to find her,\nA Wrath, a seed of blood.\n(The Trojans welcomed her with triumph and praised Alexander till at last their song changed and they saw another meaning in Alexander’s name also.)\nSo the Name to Ilion came\nOn God’s thought-fulfilling flame,\nShe a vengeance and a token\nOf the unfaith to bread broken,\nOf the hearth of God betrayed,\nAgainst them whose voices swelled\nGlorying in the prize they held\nAnd the Spoiler’s vaunt outspoken\nAnd the song his brethren made\n’Mid the bridal torches burning;\nTill, behold, the ancient City\nOf King Priam turned, and turning\nTook a new song for her learning,\nA song changed and full of pity,\nWith the cry of a lost nation;\nAnd she changed the bridegroom’s name:\nCalled him Paris Ghastly-wed;\nFor her sons were with the dead,\nAnd her life one lamentation,\n’Mid blood and burning flame.\n(Like a lion’s whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great beast of prey,)\nLo, once there was a herdsman reared\nIn his own house, so stories tell,\nA lion’s whelp, a milk-fed thing\nAnd soft in life’s first opening\nAmong the sucklings of the herd;\nThe happy children loved him well,\nAnd old men smiled, and oft, they say,\nIn men’s arms, like a babe, he lay,\nBright-eyed, and toward the hand that teased him\nEagerly fawning for food or play.\nThen on a day outflashed the sudden\nRage of the lion brood of yore;\nHe paid his debt to them that fed\nWith wrack of herds and carnage red,\nYea, wrought him a great feast unbidden,\nTill all the house-ways ran with gore;\nA sight the thralls fled weeping from,\nA great red slayer, beard a-foam,\nHigh-priest of some blood-cursèd altar\nGod had uplifted against that home.\n(So was it with Helen in Troy.)\nAnd how shall I call the thing that came\nAt the first hour to Ilion city?\nCall it a dream of peace untold,\nA secret joy in a mist of gold,\nA woman’s eye that was soft, like flame,\nA flower which ate a man’s heart with pity.\nBut she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending,\nAnd a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending,\nWhen to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o’er the deep,\nWith the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind,\nA death-bride, whom brides long shall weep.\n(Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God; not so; Good Fortune may be innocent, and then there is no vengeance.)\nA grey word liveth, from the morn\nOf old time among mortals spoken,\nThat man’s Wealth waxen full shall fall\nNot childless, but get sons withal;\nAnd ever of great bliss is born\nA tear unstanched and a heart broken.\nBut I hold my thought alone and by others unbeguiled;\n’Tis the deed that is unholy shall have issue, child on child,\nSin on sin, like his begetters; and they shall be as they were.\nBut the man who walketh straight, and the house thereof, tho’ Fate\nExalt him, the children shall be fair.\n(It is Sin, it is Pride and Ruthlessness, that beget children like themselves till Justice is fulfilled upon them.)\nBut Old Sin loves, when comes the hour again,\nTo bring forth New,\nWhich laugheth lusty amid the tears of men;\nYea, and Unruth, his comrade, wherewith none\nMay plead nor strive, which dareth on and on,\nKnowing not fear nor any holy thing;\nTwo fires of darkness in a house, born true,\nLike to their ancient spring.\nBut Justice shineth in a house low-wrought\nWith smoke-stained wall,\nAnd honoureth him who filleth his own lot;\nBut the unclean hand upon the golden stair\nWith eyes averse she flieth, seeking where\nThings innocent are; and, recking not the power\nOf wealth by man misgloried, guideth all\nTo her own destined hour.\n[Here amid a great procession enter AGAMEMNON on a Chariot. Behind him on another Chariot is CASSANDRA. The CHORUS approach and make obeisance. Some of AGAMEMNON’S men have on their shields a White Horse, some a Lion. Their arms are rich and partly barbaric.]\nLEADER.\nAll hail, O King! Hail, Atreus’ Son!\nSacker of Cities! Ilion’s bane!\nWith what high word shall I greet thee again,\nHow give thee worship, and neither outrun\nThe point of pleasure, nor stint too soon?\nFor many will cling. To fair seeming\nThe faster because they have sinned erewhile;\nAnd a man may sigh with never a sting\nOf grief in his heart, and a man may smile\nWith eyes unlit and a lip that strains.\nBut the wise Shepherd knoweth his sheep,\nAnd his eyes pierce deep\nThe faith like water that fawns and feigns.\nBut I hide nothing, O King. That day\nWhen in quest of Helen our battle array\nHurled forth, thy name upon my heart’s scroll\nWas deep in letters of discord writ;\nAnd the ship of thy soul,\nIll-helmed and blindly steered was it,\nPursuing ever, through men that die,\nOne wild heart that was fain to fly.\nBut on this new day,\nFrom the deep of my thought and in love, I say\n“Sweet is a grief well ended;”\nAnd in time’s flow Thou wilt learn and know\nThe true from the false,\nOf them that were left to guard the walls\nOf thine empty Hall unfriended.\n[During the above CLYTEMNESTRA has appeared on the Palace steps, with a train of Attendants, to receive her Husband.]\nAGAMEMNON.\nTo Argos and the gods of Argolis\nAll hail, who share with me the glory of this\nHome-coming and the vengeance I did wreak\nOn Priam’s City! Yea, though none should speak,\nThe great gods heard our cause, and in one mood\nUprising, in the urn of bitter blood,\nThat men should shriek and die and towers should burn,\nCast their great vote; while over Mercy’s urn\nHope waved her empty hands and nothing fell.\nEven now in smoke that City tells her tale;\nThe wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died\nThe reek of the old fatness of her pride\nFrom hot and writhing ashes rolls afar.\nFor which let thanks, wide as our glories are,\nBe uplifted; seeing the Beast of Argos hath\nRound Ilion’s towers piled high his fence of wrath\nAnd, for one woman ravished, wrecked by force\nA City. Lo, the leap of the wild Horse\nin darkness when the Pleiades were dead;\nA mailed multitude, a Lion unfed,\nWhich leapt the tower and lapt the blood of Kings!\nLo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings.\nBut for thy words: I marked them, and I mind\nTheir meaning, and my voice shall be behind\nThine. For not many men, the proverb saith,\nCan love a friend whom fortune prospereth\nUnenvying; and about the envious brain\nCold poison clings, and doubles all the pain\nLife brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,\nAnd feels another’s gladness like a curse.\nWell can I speak. I know the mirrored glass\nCalled friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass\nAnd feign them a King’s friends. I have known but one—\nOdysseus, him we trapped against his own\nWill!—who once harnessed bore his yoke right well …\nBe he alive or dead of whom I tell\nThe tale. And for the rest, touching our state\nAnd gods, we will assemble in debate\nA concourse of all Argos, taking sure\nCounsel, that what is well now may endure\nWell, and if aught needs healing medicine, still\nBy cutting and by fire, with all good will,\nI will essay to avert the after-wrack\nSuch sickness breeds.\nAye, Heaven hath led me back;\nAnd on this hearth where still my fire doth burn\nI will go pay to heaven my due return,\nWhich guides me here, which saved me far away.\nO Victory, now mine own, be mine alway!\n[CLYTEMNESTRA, at the head of her retinue, steps forward. She controls her suspense with difficulty but gradually gains courage as she proceeds.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nYe Elders, Council of the Argive name\nHere present, I will no more hold it shame\nTo lay my passion bare before men’s eyes.\nThere comes a time to a woman when fear dies\nFor ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,\nSave me, the weight of years intolerable\nI lived while this man lay at Ilion.\nThat any woman thus should sit alone\nIn a half-empty house, with no man near,\nMakes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear\nAlway some voice of wrath; now messengers\nOf evil; now not so; then others worse,\nCrying calamity against mine and me.\nOh, had he half the wounds that variously\nCame rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,\nAll holes from heel to crown! And if he met\nAs many deaths as I met tales thereon,\nIs he some monstrous thing, some Gêryon\nThree-souled, that will not die, till o’er his head,\nThree robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?\nAye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose\nOf death had got me; but they cut me loose.\nIt was those voices alway in mine ear.\nFor that, too, young Orestes is not here\nBeside me, as were meet, seeing he above\nAll else doth hold the surety of our love;\nLet not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:\nOur loving spear-friend took him, Strophius\nThe Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy\nTwo-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,\nAnd ours here, if the rebel multitude\nShould cast the Council down. It is men’s mood\nAlway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,\nAnd sure no guile was in him.\nBut for me,\nThe old stormy rivers of my grief are dead\nNow at the spring; not one tear left unshed.\nMine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly\nWeeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee\nFor ever answerless. And did I dream,\nA gnat’s thin whirr would start me, like a scream\nOf battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,\nCrowding, too many for the time I slept.\nFrom all which stress delivered and free-souled,\nI greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,\nO forestay sure that fails not in the squall,\nO strong-based pillar of a towering hall;\nO single son to a father age-ridden;\nO land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;\nSunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;\nSpring of quick water in a desert dead ….\nHow sweet to be set free from any chain!\nThese be my words to greet him home again.\nNo god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou\nHave suffered in time past enough! And now\nDismount, O head with love and glory crowned,\nFrom this high car; yet plant not on bare ground\nThy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy.\nHo, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,\nA floor of crimson broideries to spread\nFor the King’s path. Let all the ground be red\nWhere those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,\nHome light him to the hearth he looks not for!\nWhat followeth next, our sleepless care shall see\nOrdered as God’s good pleasure may decree.\n[The attendants spread tapestries of crimson and gold from the Chariot to the Door of the Palace. AGAMEMNON does not move.]\nAGAMEMNON.\nDaughter of Leda, watcher of my fold,\nIn sooth thy welcome, grave and amply told,\nFitteth mine absent years. Though it had been\nSeemlier, methinks, some other, not my Queen,\nHad spoke these honours. For the rest, I say,\nSeek not to make me soft in woman’s way;\nCry not thy praise to me wide-mouthed, nor fling\nThy body down, as to some barbarous king.\nNor yet with broidered hangings strew my path,\nTo awake the unseen ire. ’Tis God that hath\nSuch worship; and for mortal man to press\nRude feet upon this broidered loveliness …\nI vow there is danger in it. Let my road\nBe honoured, surely; but as man, not god.\nRugs for the feet and yonder broidered pall …\nThe names ring diverse!… Aye, and not to fall\nSuddenly blind is of all gifts the best\nGod giveth, for I reckon no man blest\nEre to the utmost goal his race be run.\nSo be it; and if, as this day I have done,\nI shall do always, then I fear no ill.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nTell me but this, nowise against thy will …\nAGAMEMNON.\nMy will, be sure, shall falter not nor fade.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWas this a vow in some great peril made?\nAGAMEMNON.\nEnough! I have spoke my purpose, fixed and plain.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWere Priam the conqueror … Think, would he refrain?\nAGAMEMNON.\nOh, stores of broideries would be trampled then!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nLord, care not for the cavillings of men!\nAGAMEMNON.\nThe murmur of a people hath strange weight.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWho feareth envy, feareth to be great.\nAGAMEMNON.\n’Tis graceless when a woman strives to lead.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWhen a great conqueror yields, ’tis grace indeed,\nAGAMEMNON.\nSo in this war thou must my conqueror be?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nYield! With good will to yield is victory!\nAGAMEMNON.\nWell, if I needs must … Be it as thou hast said!\nQuick! Loose me these bound slaves on which I tread,\nAnd while I walk yon wonders of the sea\nGod grant no eye of wrath be cast on me\nFrom far!\n[The Attendants untie his shoes.]\nFor even now it likes me not\nTo waste mine house, thus marring underfoot\nThe pride thereof, and wondrous broideries\nBought in far seas with silver. But of these\nEnough.—And mark, I charge thee, this princess\nOf Ilion; tend her with all gentleness.\nGod’s eye doth see, and loveth from afar,\nThe merciful conqueror. For no slave of war\nIs slave by his own will. She is the prize\nAnd chosen flower of Ilion’s treasuries,\nSet by the soldiers’ gift to follow me.\nNow therefore, seeing I am constrained by thee\nAnd do thy will, I walk in conqueror’s guise\nBeneath my Gate, trampling sea-crimson dyes.\n[As he dismounts and sets foot on the Tapestries CLYTEMNESTRA’S women utter again their Cry of Triumph. The people bow or kneel as he passes.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThere is the sea—its caverns who shall drain?—\nBreeding of many a purple-fish the stain\nSurpassing silver, ever fresh renewed,\nFor robes of kings. And we, by right indued,\nPossess our fill thereof. Thy house, O King,\nKnoweth no stint, nor lack of anything.\nWhat trampling of rich raiment, had the cry\nSo sounded in the domes of prophesy,\nWould I have vowed these years, as price to pay\nFor this dear life in peril far away!\nWhere the root is, the leafage cometh soon\nTo clothe an house, and spread its leafy boon\nAgainst the burning star; and, thou being come,\nThou, on the midmost hearthstone of thy home,\nOh, warmth in winter leapeth to thy sign.\nAnd when God’s summer melteth into wine\nThe green grape, on that house shall coolness fall\nWhere the true man, the master, walks his hall.\nZeus, Zeus! True Master, let my prayers be true!\nAnd, oh, forget not that thou art willed to do!\n[She follows AGAMEMNON into the Palace. The retinues of both King and Queen go in after them. CASSANDRA remains.]\nCHORUS.\nWhat is this that evermore, [Strophe 1.\nA cold terror at the door\nOf this bosom presage-haunted,\nPale as death hovereth?\nWhile a song unhired, unwanted,\nBy some inward prophet chanted,\nSpeaks the secret at its core;\nAnd to cast it from my blood\nLike a dream not understood\nNo sweet-spoken Courage now\nSitteth at my heart’s dear prow.\nYet I know that manifold\nDays, like sand, have waxen old\nSince the day those shoreward-thrown\nCables flapped and line on line\nStanding forth for Ilion\nThe long galleys took the brine\n[Antistrophe 1.\nAnd in harbour—mine own eye\nHath beheld—again they lie;\nYet that lyreless music hidden\nWhispers still words of ill,\n’Tis the Soul of me unbidden,\nLike some Fury sorrow-ridden,\nWeeping over things that die.\nNeither waketh in my sense\nEver Hope’s dear confidence;\nFor this flesh that groans within,\nAnd these bones that know of Sin,\nThis tossed heart upon the spate\nOf a whirpool that is Fate,\nSurely these lie not.

Why must I come with thee….\nTo die, only to die?\nLEADER.\nThou art borne on the breath of God, thou spirit wild,\nFor thine own weird to wail,\nLike to that wingèd voice, that heart so sore\nWhich, crying alway, hungereth to cry more,\n“Itylus, Itylus,” till it sing her child\nBack to the nightingale.\nCASSANDRA.\nOh, happy Singing Bird, so sweet, so clear!\nSoft wings for her God made,\nAnd an easy passing, without pain or tear …\nFor me ’twill be torn flesh and rending blade.\nSECOND ELDER.\nWhence is it sprung, whence wafted on God’s breath,\nThis anguish reasonless?\nThis throbbing of terror shaped to melody,\nMoaning of evil blent with music high?\nWho hath marked out for thee that mystic path\nThrough thy woe’s wilderness?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas for the kiss, the kiss of Paris, his people’s bane!\nAlas for Scamander Water, the water my fathers drank!\nLong, long ago, I played about thy bank,\nAnd was cherished and grew strong;\nNow by a River of Wailing, by shores of Pain,\nSoon shall I make my song.\nLEADER.\nHow sayst thou? All too clear,\nThis ill word thou hast laid upon thy mouth!\nA babe could read thee plain.\nIt stabs within me like a serpent’s tooth,\nThe bitter thrilling music of her pain:\nI marvel as I hear.\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas for the toil, the toil of a City, worn unto death!\nAlas for my father’s worship before the citadel,\nThe flocks that bled and the tumult of their breath!\nBut no help from them came\nTo save Troy Towers from falling as they fell!…\nAnd I on the earth shall writhe, my heart aflame.\nSECOND ELDER.\nDark upon dark, new ominous words of ill!\nSure there hath swept on thee some Evil Thing,\nCrushing, which makes thee bleed\nAnd in the torment of thy vision sing\nThese plaining death-fraught oracles … Yet still, still,\nTheir end I cannot read!\nCASSANDRA. [By an effort she regains mastery of herself, and speaks directly to the Leader.]\n’Fore God, mine oracle shall no more hide\nWith veils his visage, like a new-wed bride!\nA shining wind out of this dark shall blow,\nPiercing the dawn, growing as great waves grow,\nTo burst in the heart of sunrise … stronger far\nThan this poor pain of mine. I will not mar\nWith mists my wisdom.\nBe near me as I go,\nTracking the evil things of long ago,\nAnd bear me witness. For this roof, there clings\nMusic about it, like a choir which sings\nOne-voiced, but not well-sounding, for not good\nThe words are. Drunken, drunken, and with blood,\nTo make them dare the more, a revelling rout\nIs in the rooms, which no man shall cast out,\nOf sister Furies. And they weave to song,\nHaunting the House, its first blind deed of wrong,\nSpurning in turn that King’s bed desecrate,\nDefiled, which paid a brother’s sin with hate….\nHath it missed or struck, mine arrow? Am I a poor\nDreamer, that begs and babbles at the door?\nGive first thine oath in witness, that I know\nOf this great dome the sins wrought long ago.\nELDER.\nAnd how should oath of mine, though bravely sworn,\nAppease thee? Yet I marvel that one born\nFar over seas, of alien speech, should fall\nSo apt, as though she had lived here and seen all.\nCASSANDRA.\nThe Seer Apollo made me too to see.\nELDER (in a low voice).\nWas the God’s heart pierced with desire for thee?\nCASSANDRA.\nTime was, I held it shame hereof to speak.\nELDER.\nAh, shame is for the mighty, not the weak.\nCASSANDRA.\nWe wrestled, and his breath to me was sweet.\nELDER.\nYe came to the getting of children, as is meet?\nCASSANDRA.\nI swore to Loxias, and I swore a lie.\nELDER.\nAlready thine the gift of prophecy?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlready I showed my people all their path.\nELDER.\nAnd Loxias did not smite thee in his wrath?\nCASSANDRA.\nAfter that sin … no man believed me more.\nELDER.\nNay, then, to us thy wisdom seemeth sure.\nCASSANDRA.\nOh, oh! Agony, agony!\nAgain the awful pains of prophecy\nAre on me, maddening as they fall….\nYe see them there … beating against the wall?\nSo young … like shapes that gather in a dream …\nSlain by a hand they loved. Children they seem,\nMurdered … and in their hands they bear baked meat:\nI think it is themselves. Yea, flesh; I see it;\nAnd inward parts…. Oh, what a horrible load\nTo carry! And their father drank their blood.\nFrom these, I warn ye, vengeance broodeth still,\nA lion’s rage, which goes not forth to kill\nBut lurketh in his lair, watching the high\nHall of my war-gone master … Master? Aye;\nMine, mine! The yoke is nailed about my neck….\nOh, lord of ships and trampler on the wreck\nOf Ilion, knows he not this she-wolf’s tongue,\nWhich licks and fawns, and laughs with ear up-sprung,\nTo bite in the end like secret death?—And can\nThe woman? Slay a strong and armèd man? …\nWhat fangèd reptile like to her doth creep?\nSome serpent amphisbene, some Skylla, deep\nHoused in the rock, where sailors shriek and die,\nMother of Hell blood-raging, which doth cry\nOn her own flesh war, war without alloy …\nGod! And she shouted in his face her joy,\nLike men in battle when the foe doth break.\nAnd feigns thanksgiving for his safety’s sake!\nWhat if no man believe me? ’Tis all one.\nThe thing which must be shall be; aye, and soon\nThou too shalt sorrow for these things, and here\nStanding confess me all too true a seer.\nLEADER.\nThe Thyestean feast of children slain\nI understood, and tremble. Aye, my brain\nReels at these visions, beyond guesswork true.\nBut after, though I heard, I had lost the clue.\nCASSANDRA.\nMan, thou shalt look on Agamemnon dead.\nLEADER.\nPeace, Mouth of Evil! Be those words unsaid!\nCASSANDRA.\nNo god of peace hath watch upon that hour.\nLEADER.\nIf it must come. Forefend it, Heavenly Power!\nCASSANDRA.\nThey do not think of prayer; they think of death.\nLEADER.\nThey? Say, what man this foul deed compasseth?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas, thou art indeed fallen far astray!\nLEADER.\nHow could such deed be done? I see no way.\nCASSANDRA.\nYet know I not the Greek tongue all too well?\nLEADER.\nGreek are the Delphic dooms, but hard to spell.\nCASSANDRA.\nAh! Ah! There!\nWhat a strange fire! It moves … It comes at me.\nO Wolf Apollo, mercy! O agony! …\nWhy lies she with a wolf, this lioness lone,\nTwo-handed, when the royal lion is gone?\nGod, she will kill me! Like to them that brew\nPoison, I see her mingle for me too\nA separate vial in her wrath, and swear,\nWhetting her blade for him, that I must share\nHis death … because, because he hath dragged me here!\nOh, why these mockers at my throat? This gear\nOf wreathèd bands, this staff of prophecy?\nI mean to kill you first, before I die.\nBegone!\n[She tears off her prophetic habiliments; and presently throws them on the ground, and stamps on them.]\nDown to perdition! … Lie ye so?\nSo I requite you! Now make rich in woe\nSome other Bird of Evil, me no more!\n[Coming to herself.]\nAh, see! It is Apollo’s self, hath tore\nHis crown from me! Who watched me long ago\nIn this same prophet’s robe, by friend, by foe,\nAll with one voice, all blinded, mocked to scorn:\n“A thing of dreams,” “a beggar-maid outworn,”\nPoor, starving and reviled, I endured all;\nAnd now the Seer, who called me till my call\nWas perfect, leads me to this last dismay….\n’Tis not the altar-stone where men did slay\nMy father; ’tis a block, a block with gore\nYet hot, that waits me, of one slain before.\nYet not of God unheeded shall we lie.\nThere cometh after, one who lifteth high\nThe downfallen; a branch where blossometh\nA sire’s avenging and a mother’s death.\nExiled and wandering, from this land outcast,\nOne day He shall return, and set the last\nCrown on these sins that have his house downtrod.\nFor, lo, there is a great oath sworn of God,\nHis father’s upturned face shall guide him home.\nWhy should I grieve? Why pity these men’s doom?\nI who have seen the City of Ilion\nPass as she passed; and they who cast her down\nHave thus their end, as God gives judgement sure….\nI go to drink my cup. I will endure\nTo die. O Gates, Death-Gates, all hail to you!\nOnly, pray God the blow be stricken true!\nPray God, unagonized, with blood that flows\nQuick unto friendly death, these eyes may close!\nLEADER.\nO full of sorrows, full of wisdom great,\nWoman, thy speech is a long anguish; yet,\nKnowing thy doom, why walkst thou with clear eyes,\nLike some god-blinded beast, to sacrifice?\nCASSANDRA.\nThere is no escape, friends; only vain delay.\nLEADER.\nIs not the later still the sweeter day?\nCASSANDRA.\nThe day is come. Small profit now to fly.\nLEADER.\nThrough all thy griefs, Woman, thy heart is high.\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas! None that is happy hears that praise.\nLEADER.\nAre not the brave dead blest in after days?\nCASSANDRA.\nO Father! O my brethren brave, I come!\n[She moves towards the House, but recoils shuddering.]\nLEADER.\nWhat frights thee? What is that thou startest from?\nCASSANDRA.\nAh, faugh! Faugh!\nLEADER.\nWhat turns thee in that blind\nHorror? Unless some loathing of the mind …\nCASSANDRA.\nDeath drifting from the doors, and blood like rain!\nLEADER.\n’Tis but the dumb beasts at the altar slain.\nCASSANDRA.\nAnd vapours from a charnel-house … See there!\nLEADER.\n’Tis Tyrian incense clouding in the air.\nCASSANDRA (recovering herself again).\nSo be it!—I will go, in yonder room\nTo weep mine own and Agamemnon’s doom.\nMay death be all! Strangers, I am no bird\nThat pipeth trembling at a thicket stirred\nBy the empty wind. Bear witness on that day\nWhen woman for this woman’s life shall pay,\nAnd man for man ill-mated low shall lie:\nI ask this boon, as being about to die.\nLEADER.\nAlas, I pity thee thy mystic fate!\nCASSANDRA.\nOne word, one dirge-song would I utter yet\nO’er mine own corpse. To this last shining Sun\nI pray that, when the Avenger’s work is done,\nHis enemies may remember this thing too,\nThis little thing, the woman slave they slew!\nO world of men, farewell! A painted show\nIs all thy glory; and when life is low\nThe touch of a wet sponge out-blotteth all.\nOh, sadder this than any proud man’s fall!\n[She goes into the House.]\nCHORUS.\nGreat Fortune is an hungry thing,\nAnd filleth no heart anywhere,\nThough men with fingers menacing\nPoint at the great house, none will dare,\nWhen Fortune knocks, to bar the door\nProclaiming: “Come thou here no more!”\nLo, to this man the Gods have given\nGreat Ilion in the dust to tread\nAnd home return, emblazed of heaven;\nIf it is writ, he too shall go\nThrough blood for blood spilt long ago;\nIf he too, dying for the dead,\nShould crown the deaths of alien years,\nWhat mortal afar off, who hears,\nShall boast him Fortune’s Child, and led\nAbove the eternal tide of tears?\n[A sudden Cry from within.]\nVOICE.\nHo! Treason in the house! I am wounded: slain.\nLEADER.\nHush! In the castle! ’Twas a cry\nOf some man wounded mortally.\nVOICE.\nAh God, another! I am stricken again.\nLEADER.\nI think the deed is done. It was the King\nWho groaned…. Stand close, and think if anything….\n[The Old Men gather together under the shock, and debate confusedly.]\nELDER B.\nI give you straight my judgement. Summon all\nThe citizens to rescue. Sound a call!\nELDER C.\nNo, no! Burst in at once without a word!\nIn, and convict them by their dripping sword!\nELDER D.\nYes; that or something like it. Quick, I say,\nBe doing! ’Tis a time for no delay.\nELDER E.\nWe have time to think. This opening … They have planned\nSome scheme to make enslavement of the land.\nELDER F.\nYes, while we linger here! They take no thought\nOf lingering, and their sword-arm sleepeth not!\nELDER G.\nI have no counsel. I can speak not. Oh,\nLet him give counsel who can strike a blow!\nELDER H.\nI say as this man says. I have no trust\nIn words to raise a dead man from the dust.\nELDER I.\nHow mean you? Drag out our poor lives, and stand\nCowering to these defilers of the land?\nELDER J.\nNay, ’tis too much! Better to strive and die!\nDeath is an easier doom than slavery.\nELDER K.\nWe heard a sound of groaning, nothing plain,\nHow know we—are we seers?—that one is slain?\nELDER L.\nOh, let us find the truth out, ere we grow\nThus passionate! To surmise is not to know.\nLEADER.\nBreak in, then! ’Tis the counsel ye all bring,\nAnd learn for sure, how is it with the King.\n[They cluster up towards the Palace Door, as though to force an entrance, when the great Door swings open, revealing CLYTEMNESTRA, who stands, axe in hand, over the dead bodies of AGAMEMNON and CASSANDRA. The body of AGAMEMNON is wrapped in a rich crimson web. There is blood on CLYTEMNESTRA’S brow, and she speaks in wild triumph.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nOh, lies enough and more have I this day\nSpoken, which now I shame not to unsay.\nHow should a woman work, to the utter end,\nHate on a damnèd hater, feigned a friend;\nHow pile perdition round him, hunter-wise,\nToo high for overleaping, save by lies?\nTo me this hour was dreamed of long ago;\nA thing of ancient hate. ’Twas very slow\nIn coming, but it came. And here I stand\nEven where I struck, with all the deed I planned\nDone! ’Twas so wrought—what boots it to deny?—\nThe man could neither guard himself nor fly.\nAn endless web, as by some fisher strung,\nA deadly plenteousness of robe, I flung\nAll round him, and struck twice; and with two cries\nHis limbs turned water and broke; and as he lies\nI cast my third stroke in, a prayer well-sped\nTo Zeus of Hell, who guardeth safe his dead!\nSo there he gasped his life out as he lay;\nAnd, gasping, the blood spouted … Like dark spray\nThat splashed, it came, a salt and deathly dew;\nSweet, sweet as God’s dear rain-drops ever blew\nO’er a parched field, the day the buds are born! …\nWhich things being so, ye Councillors high-born,\nDepart in joy, if joy ye will. For me,\nI glory. Oh, if such a thing might be\nAs o’er the dead thank-offering to outpour,\nOn this dead it were just, aye, just and more,\nWho filled the cup of the House with treacheries\nCurse-fraught, and here hath drunk it to the lees!\nLEADER.\nWe are astonied at thy speech. To fling,\nWild mouth! such vaunt over thy murdered King!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWouldst fright me, like a witless woman? Lo,\nThis bosom shakes not. And, though well ye know,\nI tell you … Curse me as ye will, or bless,\n’Tis all one … This is Agamemnon; this,\nMy husband, dead by my right hand, a blow\nStruck by a righteous craftsman. Aye, ’tis so.\nCHORUS.\nWoman, what evil tree,\nWhat poison grown of the ground\nOr draught of the drifting sea\nWay to thy lips hath found,\nMaking thee clothe thy heart\nIn rage, yea, in curses burning\nWhen thine own people pray?\nThou hast hewn, thou hast cast away;\nAnd a thing cast away thou art,\nA thing of hate and a spurning!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, now, for me, thou hast thy words of fate;\nExile from Argos and the people’s hate\nFor ever! Against him no word was cried,\nWhen, recking not, as ’twere a beast that died,\nWith flocks abounding o’er his wide domain,\nHe slew his child, my love, my flower of pain, …\nGreat God, as magic for the winds of Thrace!\nWhy was not he man-hunted from his place,\nTo purge the blood that stained him? … When the deed\nIs mine, oh, then thou art a judge indeed!\nBut threat thy fill. I am ready, and I stand\nContent; if thy hand beateth down my hand,\nThou rulest. If aught else be God’s decree,\nThy lesson shall be learned, though late it be.\nCHORUS.\nThy thought, it is very proud;\nThy breath is the scorner’s breath;\nIs not the madness loud\nIn thy heart, being drunk with death?\nYea, and above thy brow\nA star of the wet blood burneth!\nOh, doom shall have yet her day,\nThe last friend cast away,\nWhen lie doth answer lie\nAnd a stab for a stab returneth!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd heark what Oath-gods gather to my side!\nBy my dead child’s Revenge, now satisfied,\nBy Mortal Blindness, by all Powers of Hell\nWhich Hate, to whom in sacrifice he fell,\nMy Hope shall walk not in the house of Fear,\nWhile on my hearth one fire yet burneth clear,\nOne lover, one Aigisthos, as of old!\nWhat should I fear, when fallen here I hold\nThis foe, this scorner of his wife, this toy\nAnd fool of each Chryseis under Troy;\nAnd there withal his soothsayer and slave,\nHis chanting bed-fellow, his leman brave,\nWho rubbed the galleys’ benches at his side.\nBut, oh, they had their guerdon as they died!\nFor he lies thus, and she, the wild swan’s way,\nHath trod her last long weeping roundelay,\nAnd lies, his lover, ravisht o’er the main\nFor his bed’s comfort and my deep disdain.\nCHORUS. (Some Elders.)\nWould God that suddenly\nWith no great agony,\nNo long sick-watch to keep,\nMy hour would come to me,\nMy hour, and presently\nBring the eternal, the\nUnwaking Sleep,\nNow that my Shepherd, he\nWhose love watched over me,\nLies in the deep!\nANOTHER.\nFor woman’s sake he endured and battled well,\nAnd by a woman’s hand he fell.\nOTHERS.\nWhat hast thou done, O Helen blind of brain,\nO face that slew the souls on Ilion’s plain,\nOne face, one face, and many a thousand slain?\nThe hate of old that on this castle lay,\nBuilded in lust, a husband’s evil day,\nHath bloomed for thee a perfect flower again\nAnd unforgotten, an old and burning stain\nNever to pass away.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNay, pray not for the hour of death, being tried\nToo sore beneath these blows\nNeither on Helen turn thy wrath aside,\nThe Slayer of Men, the face which hath destroyed\nIts thousand Danaan souls, and wrought a wide\nWound that no leech can close.\nCHORUS.\n—Daemon, whose heel is set\nOn the House and the twofold kin\nOf the high Tantalidae,\nA power, heavy as fate,\nThou wieldest through woman’s sin,\nPiercing the heart of me!\n—Like a raven swoln with hate\nHe hath set on the dead his claw,\nHe croaketh a song to sate\nHis fury, and calls it Law!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAh, call upon Him! Yea, call—\nAnd thy thought hath found its path—\nThe Daemon who haunts this hall,\nThe thrice-engorged Wrath;\nFrom him is the ache of the flesh\nFor blood born and increased;\nEre the old sore hath ceased\nIt oozeth afresh.\nCHORUS.\n—Indeed He is very great,\nAnd heavy his anger, He,\nThe Daemon who guides the fate\nOf the old Tantalidae:\nAlas, alas, an evil tale ye tell\nOf desolate angers and insatiable!\n—Ah me,\nAnd yet ’tis all as Zeus hath willed,\nDoer of all and Cause of all;\nBy His Word every chance doth fall,\nNo end without Him is fulfilled;\nWhat of these things\nBut cometh by high Heaven’s counsellings?\n[A band of Mourners has gathered within the House.]\nMOURNERS.\nAh, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!\nHow shall I weep, what word shall I say?\nCaught in the web of this spider thing,\nIn foul death gasping thy life away!\nWoe’s me, woe’s me, for this slavish lying,\nThe doom of craft and the lonely dying,\nThe iron two-edged and the hands that slay!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd criest thou still this deed hath been\nMy work?

It cannot be,\nYet from the deeps of ancient sin\nThe Avenger may have wrought with thee.\n—On the red Slayer crasheth, groping wild\nFor blood, more blood, to build his peace again,\nAnd wash like water the old frozen stain\nOf the torn child.\nMOURNERS.\nAh, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!\nHow shall I weep, what word shall I say?\nCaught in the web of this spider thing,\nIn foul death gasping thy life away.\nWoe’s me, woe’s me, for this slavish lying,\nThe doom of craft and the lonely dying,\nThe iron two-edged and the hands that slay!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd what of the doom of craft that first\nHe planted, making the House accurst?\nWhat of the blossom, from this root riven,\nIphigenîa, the unforgiven?\nEven as the wrong was, so is the pain:\nHe shall not laugh in the House of the slain,\nWhen the count is scored;\nHe hath but spoilèd and paid again\nThe due of the sword.\nCHORUS.\nI am lost; my mind dull-eyed\nKnows not nor feels\nWhither to fly nor hide\nWhile the House reels.\nThe noise of rain that falls\nOn the roof affrighteth me,\nWashing away the walls;\nRain that falls bloodily.\nDoth ever the sound abate?\nLo, the next Hour of Fate\nWhetting her vengeance due\nOn new whet-stones, for new\nWorkings of hate.\nMOURNERS.\nWould thou hadst covered me, Earth, O Earth,\nOr e’er I had looked on my lord thus low,\nIn the pallèd marble of silvern girth!\nWhat hands may shroud him, what tears may flow?\nNot thine, O Woman who dared to slay him,\nThou durst not weep to him now, nor pray him,\nNor pay to his soul the deep unworth\nOf gift or prayer to forget thy blow.\n—Oh, who with heart sincere\nShall bring praise or grief\nTo lay on the sepulchre\nOf the great chief?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nHis burial is not thine to array.\nBy me he fell, by me he died,\nI watch him to the grave, not cried\nBy mourners of his housefolk; nay,\nHis own child for a day like this\nWaits, as is seemly, and shall run\nBy the white waves of Acheron\nTo fold him in her arms and kiss!\nCHORUS.\nLo, she who was erst reviled\nRevileth; and who shall say?\nSpoil taken from them that spoiled,\nLife-blood from them that slay!\nSurely while God ensueth\nHis laws, while Time doth run\n’Tis written: On him that doeth\nIt shall be done.\nThis is God’s law and grace,\nWho then shall hunt the race\nOf curses from out this hall?\nThe House is sealed withal\nTo dreadfulness.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, thou hast found the Law, and stept\nIn Truth’s way.—Yet even now I call\nThe Living Wrath which haunts this hall\nTo truce and compact. I accept\nAll the affliction he doth heap\nUpon me, and I charge him go\nFar off with his self-murdering woe\nTo strange men’s houses. I will keep\nSome little dower, and leave behind\nAll else, contented utterly.\nI have swept the madness from the sky\nWherein these brethren slew their kind.\n[As she ceases, exhausted and with the fire gone out of her, AIGISTHOS, with Attendants, bursts triumphantly in.]\nAIGISTHOS.\nO shining day, O dawn of righteousness\nFulfilled! Now, now indeed will I confess\nThat divine watchers o’er man’s death and birth\nLook down on all the anguish of the earth,\nNow that I see him lying, as I love\nTo see him, in this net the Furies wove,\nTo atone the old craft of his father’s hand.\nFor Atreus, this man’s father, in this land\nReigning, and by Thyestes in his throne\nChallenged—he was his brother and mine own\nFather From home and city cast him out;\nAnd he, after long exile, turned about\nAnd threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won\nPromise of so much mercy, that his own\nLife-blood should reek not in his father’s hall.\nThen did that godless brother, Atreus, call,\nTo greet my sire—More eagerness, O God,\nWas there than love!—a feast of brotherhood.\nAnd, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat\nBefore him his dead children. The white feet\nAnd finger-fringèd hands apart he set,\nVeiled from all seeing, and made separate\nThe tables. And he straightway, knowing naught,\nTook of those bodies, eating that which wrought\nNo health for all his race. And when he knew\nThe unnatural deed, back from the board he threw,\nSpewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake\nThe table, to make strong the curse he spake:\n“Thus perish all of Pleisthenês begot!”\nFor that lies this man here; and all the plot\nIs mine, most righteously. For me, the third,\nWhen butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared\nAnd cast me with my broken sire that day,\nA little thing in swaddling clothes, away\nTo exile; where I grew, and at the last\nJustice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast\nIn a far land, mine arm hath reached this king;\nMy brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling;\nAnd all is well. I have seen mine enemy\nDead in the snare, and care not if I die!\nLEADER.\nAigisthos, to insult over the dead\nI like not. All the counsel, thou hast said,\nWas thine alone; and thine the will that spilled\nThis piteous blood. As justice is fulfilled,\nThou shalt not ’scape—so my heart presageth—-The\nday of cursing and the hurlèd death.\nAIGISTHOS.\nHow, thou poor oarsman of the nether row,\nWhen the main deck is master? Sayst thou so?…\nTo such old heads the lesson may prove hard,\nI fear me, when Obedience is the word.\nBut hunger, and bonds, and cold, help men to find\nTheir wits.—They are wondrous healers of the mind!\nHast eyes and seest not this?—Against a spike\nKick not, for fear it pain thee if thou strike.\nLEADER (turning from him to CLYTEMNESTRA).\nWoman! A soldier fresh from war! To keep\nWatch o’er his house and shame him in his sleep…\nTo plot this craft against a lord of spears…\n[CLYTEMNESTRA, as though in a dream, pays no heed. AIGISTHOS interupts.]\nAIGISTHOS.\nThese be the words, old man, that lead to tears!\nThou hast an opposite to Orpheus’ tongue,\nWho chained all things with his enchanting song,\nFor thy mad noise will put the chains on thee.\nEnough! Once mastered thou shalt tamer be.\nLEADER.\nThou master? Is old Argos so accurst?\nThou plotter afar off, who never durst\nRaise thine own hand to affront and strike him down…\nAIGISTHOS.\nTo entice him was the wife’s work. I was known\nBy all men here, his old confessed blood-foe.\nHowbeit, with his possessions I will know\nHow to be King. And who obeys not me\nShall be yoked hard, no easy trace-horse he,\nCorn-flushed. Hunger, and hunger’s prison mate,\nThe clammy murk, shall see his rage abate.\nLEADER.\nThou craven soul! Why not in open strife\nSlay him? Why lay the blood-sin on his wife,\nStaining the Gods of Argos, making ill\nThe soil thereof?…But young Orestes still\nLiveth. Oh, Fate will guide him home again,\nAvenging, conquering, home to kill these twain!\nAIGISTHOS.\n’Fore God, if ’tis your pleasure thus to speak and do, ye soon shall hear!\nHo there, my trusty pikes, advance!

Stand and be ready, sword from sheath!\nAIGISTHOS.\nBy Heaven, I also, sword in hand, am ready, and refuse not death!\nLEADER.\nCome, find it! We accept thy word. Thou offerest what we hunger for.\n[Some of the Elders draw swords with the Leader; others have collapsed with weakness. Men from AGAMEMNON’S retinue have gathered and prepare for battle, when, before they can come to blows, CLYTEMNESTRA breaks from her exhausted silence.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNay, peace, O best-belovèd! Peace! And let us work no evil more.\nSurely the reaping of the past is a full harvest, and not good,\nAnd wounds enough are everywhere.—Let us not stain ourselves with blood.\nYe reverend Elders, go your ways, to his own dwelling every one,\nEre things be wrought for which men suffer.—What we did must needs be done.\nAnd if of all these strifes we now may have no more, oh, I will kneel\nAnd praise God, bruisèd though we be beneath the Daemon’s heavy heel.\nThis is the word a woman speaks, to hear if any man will deign.\nAIGISTHOS.\nAnd who are these to burst in flower of folly thus of tongue and brain,\nAnd utter words of empty sound and perilous, tempting Fortune’s frown,\nAnd leave wise counsel all forgot, and gird at him who wears the crown?\nLEADER.\nTo cringe before a caitiff’s crown, it squareth not with Argive ways.\nAIGISTHOS.

    "content":"THE LIBATION-BEARERS\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nORESTES\nCHORUS OF CAPTIVE WOMEN\nELECTRA\nA NURSE\nCLYTEMNESTRA\nAEGISTHUS\nAN ATTENDANT\nPYLADES\nThe Scene is the Tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae; afterwards, the Palace of Atreus, hard by the Tomb.\nOrestes\nLord of the shades and patron of the realm\nThat erst my father swayed, list now my prayer,\nHermes, and save me with thine aiding arm,\nMe who from banishment returning stand\nOn this my country; lo, my foot is set\nOn this grave-mound, and herald-like, as thou,\nOnce and again, I bid my father hear.\nAnd these twin locks, from mine head shorn, I bring,\nAnd one to Inachus the river-god,\nMy young life’s nurturer, I dedicate,\nAnd one in sign of mourning unfulfilled\nI lay, though late, on this my father’s grave.\nFor O my father, not beside thy corse\nStood I to wail thy death, nor was my hand\nStretched out to bear thee forth to burial.\nWhat sight is yonder? what this woman-throng\nHitherward coming, by their sable garb\nMade manifest as mourners? What hath chanced?\nDoth some new sorrow hap within the home?\nOr rightly may I deem that they draw near\nBearing libations, such as soothe the ire\nOf dead men angered, to my father’s grave?\nNay, such they are indeed; for I descry\nElectra mine own sister pacing hither,\nIn moody grief conspicuous. Grant, O Zeus,\nGrant me my father’s murder to avenge—\nBe thou my willing champion!\nPylades,\nPass we aside, till rightly I discern\nWherefore these women throng in suppliance.\n[Exeunt Pylades and Orestes; enter the Chorus bearing vessels for libation; Electra follows them; they pace slowly towards the tomb of Agamemnon.\nCHORUS\nForth from the royal halls by high command\nI bear libations for the dead.\nRings on my smitten breast my smiting hand,\nAnd all my cheek is rent and red,\nFresh-furrowed by my nails, and all my soul\nThis many a day doth feed on cries of dole.\nAnd trailing tatters of my vest,\nIn looped and windowed raggedness forlorn,\nHang rent around my breast,\nEven as I, by blows of Fate most stern\nSaddened and torn.\nOracular thro’ visions, ghastly clear,\nBearing a blast of wrath from realms below,\nAnd stiffening each rising hair with dread,\nCame out of dream-land Fear,\nAnd, loud and awful, bade\nThe shriek ring out at midnight’s witching hour,\nAnd brooded, stern with woe,\nAbove the inner house, the woman’s bower.\nAnd seers inspired did read the dream on oath,\nChanting aloud In realms below\nThe dead are wroth;\nAgainst their slayers yet their ire doth glow.\nTherefore to bear this gift of graceless worth—\nO Earth, my nursing mother!—\nThe woman god-accurs’d doth send me forth\nLest one crime bring another.\nIll is the very word to speak, for none\nCan ransom or atone\nFor blood once shed and darkening the plain.\nO hearth of woe and bane,\nO state that low doth lie!\nSunless, accursed of men, the shadows brood\nAbove the home of murdered majesty.\nRumour of might, unquestioned, unsubdued,\nPervading ears and soul of lesser men,\nIs silent now and dead.\nYet rules a viler dread;\nFor bliss and power, however won,\nAs gods, and more than gods, dazzle our mortal ken.\nJustice doth mark, with scales that swiftly sway,\nSome that are yet in light;\nOthers in interspace of day and night,\nTill Fate arouse them, stay;\nAnd some are lapped in night, where all things are undone.\nOn the life-giving lap of Earth\nBlood hath flowed forth;\nAnd now, the seed of vengeance, clots the plain—\nUnmelting, uneffaced the stain.\nAnd Atè tarries long, but at the last\nThe sinner’s heart is cast\nInto pervading, waxing pangs of pain.\nLo, when man’s force doth ope\nThe virgin doors, there is nor cure nor hope\nFor what is lost,—even so, I deem,\nThough in one channel ran Earth’s every stream,\nLaving the hand defiled from murder’s stain,\nIt were vain.\nAnd upon me—ah me!—the gods have laid\nThe woe that wrapped round Troy,\nWhat time they led down from home and kin\nUnto a slave’s employ—\nThe doom to bow the head\nAnd watch our master’s will\nWork deeds of good and ill—\nTo see the headlong sway of force and sin,\nAnd hold restrained the spirit’s bitter hate,\nWailing the monarch’s fruitless fate,\nHiding my face within my robe, and fain\nOf tears, and chilled with frost of hidden pain.\nELECTRA\nHand maidens, orderers of the palace-halls,\nSince at my side ye come, a suppliant train,\nCompanions of this offering, counsel me\nAs best befits the time: for I, who pour\nUpon the grave these streams funereal,\nWith what fair word can I invoke my sire?\nShall I aver, Behold, I bear these gifts\nFrom well-beloved wife unto her well-beloved lord,\nWhen ’tis from her, my mother, that they come?\nI dare not say it: of all words I fail\nWherewith to consecrate unto my sire\nThese sacrificial honours on his grave.\nOr shall I speak this word, as mortals use—\nGive back, to those who send these coronals\nFull recompense—of ills for acts malign?\nOr shall I pour this draught for Earth to drink,\nSans word or reverence, as my sire was slain,\nAnd homeward pass with unreverted eyes,\nCasting the bowl away, as one who flings\nThe household cleansings to the common road?\nBe art and part, O friends, in this my doubt,\nEven as ye are in that one common hate\nWhereby we live attended: fear ye not\nThe wrath of any man, nor hide your word\nWithin your breast: the day of death and doom\nAwaits alike the freeman and the slave.\nSpeak, then, if aught thou know’st to aid us more.\nCHORUS\nThou biddest; I will speak my soul’s thought out,\nRevering as a shrine thy father’s grave.\nELECTRA\nSay then thy say, as thou his tomb reverest.\nCHORUS\nSpeak solemn words to them that love, and pour.\nELECTRA\nAnd of his kin whom dare I name as kind?\nCHORUS\nThyself; and next, whoe’er Aegisthus scorns.\nELECTRA\nThen ’tis myself and thou, my prayer must name.\nCHORUS\nWhoe’er they be, ’tis thine to know and name them.\nELECTRA\nIs there no other we may claim as ours?\nCHORUS\nThink of Orestes, though far-off he be.\nELECTRA\nRight well in this too hast thou schooled my thought.\nCHORUS\nMindfully, next, on those who shed the blood—\nELECTRA\nPray on them what? expound, instruct my doubt.\nCHORUS\nThis; Upon them some god or mortal come——\nELECTRA\nAs judge or as avenger? speak thy thought.\nCHORUS\nPray in set terms, Who shall the slayer slay.\nELECTRA\nBeseemeth it to ask such boon of heaven?\nCHORUS\nHow not, to wreak a wrong upon a foe?\nELECTRA\nO mighty Hermes, warder of the shades,\nHerald of upper and of under world,\nProclaim and usher down my prayer’s appeal\nUnto the gods below, that they with eyes\nWatchful behold these halls, my sire’s of old—\nAnd unto Earth, the mother of all things,\nAnd foster-nurse, and womb that takes their seed.\nLo, I that pour these draughts for men now dead,\nCall on my father, who yet holds in ruth\nMe and mine own Orestes, Father, speak—\nHow shall thy children rule thine halls again?\nHomeless we are and sold; and she who sold\nIs she who bore us; and the price she took\nIs he who joined with her to work thy death,\nAegisthus, her new lord. Behold me here\nBrought down to slave’s estate, and far away\nWanders Orestes, banished from the wealth\nThat once was thine, the profit of thy care,\nWhereon these revel in a shameful joy.\nFather, my prayer is said; ’tis thine to hear—\nGrant that some fair fate bring Orestes home,\nAnd unto me grant these—a purer soul\nThan is my mother’s, a more stainless hand.\nThese be my prayers for us; for thee, O sire,\nI cry that one may come to smite thy foes,\nAnd that the slayers may in turn be slain.\nCursed is their prayer, and thus I bar its path,\nPraying mine own, a counter-curse on them.\nAnd thou, send up to us the righteous boon\nFor which we pray: thine aids be heaven and earth,\nAnd justice guide the right to victory,\n[To the Chorus.\nThus have I prayed, and thus I shed these streams,\nAnd follow ye the wont, and as with flowers\nCrown ye with many a tear and cry the dirge,\nYour lips ring out above the dead man’s grave.\n[She pours the libations.\nCHORUS\nWoe, woe, woe!\nLet the teardrop fall, plashing on the ground\nWhere our lord lies low:\nFall and cleanse away the cursed libation’s stain,\nShed on this grave-mound,\nFenced wherein together, gifts of good or bane\nFrom the dead are found.\nLord of Argos, hearken!\nThough around thee darken\nMist of death and hell, arise and hear!\nHearken and awaken to our cry of woe!\nWho with might of spear\nShall our home deliver?\nWho like Ares bend until it quiver,\nBend the northern bow?\nWho with hand upon the hilt himself will thrust with glaive,\nThrust and slay and save?\nELECTRA\nLo! the earth drinks them, to my sire they pass—\nLearn ye with me of this thing new and strange.\nCHORUS\nSpeak thou; my breast doth palpitate with fear.\nELECTRA\nI see upon the tomb a curl new shorn.\nCHORUS\nShorn from what man or what deep-girded maid?\nELECTRA\nThat may he guess who will; the sign is plain.\nCHORUS\nLet me learn this of thee; let youth prompt age.\nELECTRA\nNone is there here but I, to clip such gift.\nCHORUS\nFor they who thus should mourn him hate him sore.\nELECTRA\nAnd lo! in truth the hair exceeding like—\nCHORUS\nLike to what locks and whose? instruct me that.\nELECTRA\nLike unto those my father’s children wear.\nCHORUS\nThen is this lock Orestes’ secret gift?\nELECTRA\nMost like it is unto the curls he wore,\nCHORUS\nYet how dared he to come unto his home?\nELECTRA\nHe hath but sent it, clipt to mourn his sire.\nCHORUS\nIt is a sorrow grievous as his death,\nThat he should live yet never dare return.\nELECTRA\nYea, and my heart o’erflows with gall of grief,\nAnd I am pierced as with a cleaving dart;\nLike to the first drops after drought, my tears\nFall down at will, a bitter bursting tide,\nAs on this lock I gaze; I cannot deem\nThat any Argive save Orestes’ self\nWas ever lord thereof; nor, well I wot,\nHath she, the murd’ress, shorn and laid this lock\nTo mourn him whom she slew—my mother she,\nBearing no mother’s heart, but to her race\nA loathing spirit, loathed itself of heaven!\nYet to affirm, as utterly made sure,\nThat this adornment cometh of the hand\nOf mine Orestes, brother of my soul,\nI may not venture, yet hope flatters fair!\nAh well-a-day, that this dumb hair had voice\nTo glad mine ears, as might a messenger,\nBidding me sway no more ’twixt fear and hope,\nClearly commanding, Cast me hence away,\nClipped was I from some head thou lovest not;\nOr, I am kin to thee, and here, as thou,\nI come to weep and deck our father’s grave.\nAid me, ye gods! for well indeed ye know\nHow in the gale and counter-gale of doubt,\nLike to the seaman’s bark, we whirl and stray.\nBut, if God will our life, how strong shall spring,\nFrom seed how small, the new tree of our home!—\nLo ye, a second sign—these footsteps, look,—\nLike to my own, a corresponsive print;\nAnd look, another footmark,—this his own,\nAnd that the foot of one who walked with him.\nMark, how the heel and tendons’ print combine,\nMeasured exact, with mine coincident!\nAlas! for doubt and anguish rack my mind.\nORESTES (approaching suddenly)\nPray thou, in gratitude for prayers fulfilled, Fair fall the rest of what I ask of heaven.\nELECTRA\nWherefore? what win I from the gods by prayer?\nORESTES\nThis, that thine eyes behold thy heart’s desire.\nELECTRA\nOn whom of mortals know’st thou that I call?\nORESTES\nI know thy yearning for Orestes deep.\nELECTRA\nSay then, wherein event hath crowned my prayer?\nORESTES\nI, I am he; seek not one more akin.\nELECTRA\nSome fraud, O stranger, weavest thou for me?\nORESTES\nAgainst myself I weave it, if I weave.\nELECTRA\nAh, thou hast mind to mock me in my woe!\nORESTES\n’Tis at mine own I mock then, mocking thine.\nELECTRA\nSpeak I with thee then as Orestes’ self?\nORESTES\nMy very face thou see’st and know’st me not,\nAnd yet but now, when thou didst see the lock\nShorn for my father’s grave, and when thy quest\nWas eager on the footprints I had made,\nEven I, thy brother, shaped and sized as thou,\nFluttered thy spirit, as at sight of me!\nLay now this ringlet whence ’twas shorn, and judge,\nAnd look upon this robe, thine own hands’ work,\nThe shuttle-prints, the creature wrought thereon—\nRefrain thyself, nor prudence lose in joy,\nFor well I wot, our kin are less than kind.\nELECTRA\nO thou that art unto our father’s home\nLove, grief and hope, for thee the tears ran down,\nFor thee, the son, the saviour that should be;\nTrust thou thine arm and win thy father’s halls!\nO aspect sweet of fourfold love to me,\nWhom upon thee the heart’s constraint bids call\nAs on my father, and the claim of love\nFrom me unto my mother turns to thee,\nFor she is very hate; to thee too turns\nWhat of my heart went out to her who died\nA ruthless death upon the altar-stone;\nAnd for myself I love thee—thee that wast\nA brother leal, sole stay of love to me.\nNow by thy side be strength and right, and Zeus\nSaviour almighty, stand to aid the twain!\nORESTES\nZeus, Zeus! look down on our estate and us,\nThe orphaned brood of him, our eagle-sire,\nWhom to his death a fearful serpent brought\nEnwinding him in coils; and we, bereft\nAnd foodless, sink with famine, all too weak\nTo bear unto the eyrie, as he bore,\nSuch quarry as he slew. Lo! I and she,\nElectra, stand before thee, fatherless,\nAnd each alike cast out and homeless made.\nELECTRA\nAnd if thou leave to death the brood of him\nWhose altar blazed for thee, whose reverence\nWas thine, all thine,—whence, in the after years,\nShall any hand like his adorn thy shrine\nWith sacrifice of flesh? the eaglets slain,\nThou wouldst not have a messenger to bear\nThine omens, once so clear, to mortal men;\nSo, if this kingly stock be withered all,\nNone on high festivals will fend thy shrine\nStoop thou to raise us! strong the race shall show,\nThough puny now it seem, and fallen low.\nCHORUS\nO children, saviours of your father’s home,\nBeware ye of your words, lest one should hear\nAnd bear them, for the tongue hath lust to tell,\nUnto our masters—whom God grant to me\nIn pitchy reek of fun’ral flame to see!\nORESTES\nNay, mighty is Apollo’s oracle\nAnd shall not fail me, whom it bade to pass\nThro’ all this peril; clear the voice rang out\nWith many warnings, sternly threatening\nTo my hot heart the wintry chill of pain,\nUnless upon the slayers of my sire\nI pressed for vengeance: this the god’s command—\nThat I, in ire for home and wealth despoiled,\nShould with a craft like theirs the slayers slay:\nElse with my very life I should atone\nThis deed undone, in many a ghastly wise\nFor he proclaimed unto the ears of men\nThat offerings, poured to angry power of death,\nExude again, unless their will be done,\nAs grim disease on those that poured them forth—\nAs leprous ulcers mounting on the flesh\nAnd with fell fangs corroding what of old\nWore natural form; and on the brow arise\nWhite poisoned hairs, the crown of this disease.\nHe spake moreover of assailing fiends\nEmpowered to quit on me my father’s blood,\nWreaking their wrath on me, what time in night\nBeneath shut lids the spirit’s eye sees clear.\nThe dart that flies in darkness, sped from hell\nBy spirits of the murdered dead who call\nUnto their kin for vengeance, formless fear,\nThe night-tide’s visitant, and madness’ curse\nShould drive and rack me; and my tortured frame\nShould be chased forth from man’s community\nAs with the brazen scorpions of the scourge.\nFor me and such as me no lustral bowl\nShould stand, no spilth of wine be poured to God\nFor me, and wrath unseen of my dead sire\nShould drive me from the shrine; no man should dare\nTo take me to his hearth, nor dwell with me:\nSlow, friendless, cursed of all should be mine end,\nAnd pitiless horror wind me for the grave,\nThis spake the god—this dare I disobey?\nYea, though I dared, the deed must yet be done;\nFor to that end diverse desires combine,—\nThe god’s behest, deep grief for him who died,\nAnd last, the grievous blank of wealth despoiled—\nAll these weigh on me, urge that Argive men,\nMinions of valour, who with soul of fire\nDid make of fencèd Troy a ruinous heap,\nBe not left slaves to two and each a woman!\nFor he, the man, wears woman’s heart; if not\nSoon shall he know, confronted by a man.\n[Orestes, Electra, and the Chorus gather round the tomb of Agamemnon for the invocation which follows.\nCHORUS\nMighty Fates, on you we call!\nBid the will of Zeus ordain\nPower to those, to whom again\nJustice turns with hand and aid!\nGrievous was the prayer one made—\nGrievous let the answer fall!\nWhere the mighty doom is set,\nJustice claims aloud her debt\nWho in blood hath dipped the steel,\nDeep in blood her meed shall feel!\nList an immemorial word—\nWhosoe’er shall take the sword\nShall perish by the sword.\nORESTES\nFather, unblest in death, O father mine!\nWhat breath of word or deed\nCan I waft on thee from this far confine\nUnto thy lowly bed,—\nWaft upon thee, in midst of darkness lying,\nHope’s counter-gleam of fire?\nYet the loud dirge of praise brings grace undying\nUnto each parted sire.\nCHORUS\nO child, the spirit of the dead,\nAltho’ upon his flesh have fed\nThe grim teeth of the flame,\nIs quelled not; after many days\nThe sting of wrath his soul shall raise,\nA vengeance to reclaim!\nTo the dead rings loud our cry—\nPlain the living’s treachery—\nSwelling, shrilling, urged on high,\nThe vengeful dirge, for parents slain,\nShall strive and shall attain.\nELECTRA\nHear me too, even me, O father, hear!\nNot by one child alone these groans, these tears are shed\nUpon thy sepulchre.\nEach, each, where thou art lowly laid,\nStands, a suppliant, homeless made:\nAh, and all is full of ill,\nComfort is there none to say!\nStrive and wrestle as we may,\nStill stands doom invincible.\nCHORUS\nNay, if so he will, the god\nStill our tears to joy can turn\nHe can bid a triumph-ode\nDrown the dirge beside this urn;\nHe to kingly halls can greet\nThe child restored, the homeward-guided feet.\nORESTES\nAh my father! hadst thou lain\nUnder Ilion’s wall,\nBy some Lycian spearman slain,\nThou hadst left in this thine hall\nHonour; thou hadst wrought for us\nFame and life most glorious.\nOver-seas if thou had’st died,\nHeavily had stood thy tomb,\nHeaped on high; but, quenched in pride,\nGrief were light unto thy home.\nCHORUS\nLoved and honoured hadst thou lain\nBy the dead that nobly fell,\nIn the under-world again,\nWhere are throned the kings of hell,\nFull of sway adorable\nThou hadst stood at their right hand—\nThou that wert, in mortal land,\nBy Fate’s ordinance and law,\nKing of kings who bear the crown\nAnd the staff, to which in awe\nMortal men bow down.\nELECTRA\nNay O father, I were fain\nOther fate had fallen on thee.\nIll it were if thou hadst lain\nOne among the common slain,\nFallen by Scamander’s side—\nThose who slew thee there should be!\nThen, untouched by slavery,\nWe had heard as from afar\nDeaths of those who should have died\n’Mid the chance of war.\nCHORUS\nO child, forbear! things all too high thou sayest.\nEasy, but vain, thy cry!\nA boon above all gold is that thou prayest,\nAn unreached destiny,\nAs of the blessèd land that far aloof\nBeyond the north wind lies;\nYet doth your double prayer ring loud reproof;\nA double scourge of sighs\nAwakes the dead; th’ avengers rise, though late;\nBlood stains the guilty pride\nOf the accursed who rule on earth, and Fate\nStands on the children’s side.\nELECTRA\nThat hath sped thro’ mine ear, like a shaft from a bow!\nZeus, Zeus! it is thou who dost send from below\nA doom on the desperate doer—ere long\nOn a mother a father shall visit his wrong.\nCHORUS\nBe it mine to upraise thro’ the reek of the pyre\nThe chant of delight, while the funeral fire\nDevoureth the corpse of a man that is slain\nAnd a woman laid low!\nFor who bids me conceal it! out-rending control,\nBlows ever stern blast of hate thro’ my soul,\nAnd before me a vision of wrath and of bane\nFlits and waves to and fro.\nORESTES\nZeus, thou alone to us art parent now.\nSmite with a rending blow\nUpon their heads, and bid the land be well:\nSet right where wrong hath stood; and thou give ear,\nO Earth, unto my prayer—\nYea, hear O mother Earth, and monarchy of hell!\nCHORUS\nNay, the law is sternly set—\nBlood-drops shed upon the ground\nPlead for other bloodshed yet;\nLoud the call of death doth sound,\nCalling guilt of olden time,\nA Fury, crowning crime with crime.\nELECTRA\nWhere, where are ye, avenging powers,\nPuissant Furies of the slain?\nBehold the relics of the race\nOf Atreus, thrust from pride of place!\nO Zeus, what home henceforth is ours,\nWhat refuge to attain?\nCHORUS\nLo, at your wail my heart throbs, wildly stirred;\nNow am I lorn with sadness,\nDarkened in all my soul, to hear your sorrow’s word.\nAnon to hope, the seat of strength, I rise,—\nShe, thrusting grief away, lifts up mine eyes\nTo the new dawn of gladness.\nORESTES\nSkills it to tell of aught save wrong on wrong,\nWrought by our mother’s deed?\nThough now she fawn for pardon, sternly strong\nStandeth our wrath, and will nor hear nor heed;\nHer children’s soul is wolfish, born from hers,\nAnd softens not by prayers.\nCHORUS\nI dealt upon my breast the blow\nThat Asian mourning women know;\nWails from my breast the fun’ral cry,\nThe Cissian weeping melody;\nStretched rendingly forth, to tatter and tear,\nMy clenched hands wander, here and there,\nFrom head to breast; distraught with blows\nThrob dizzily my brows.\nELECTRA\nAweless in hate, O mother, sternly brave!\nAs in a foeman’s grave\nThou laid’st in earth a king, but to the bier\nNo citizen drew near,—\nThy husband, thine, yet for his obsequies,\nThou bad’st no wail arise!\nORESTES\nAlas the shameful burial thou dost speak!\nYet I the vengeance of his shame will wreak—\nThat do the gods command!\nThat shall achieve mine hand!\nGrant me to thrust her life away, and I\nWill dare to die!\nCHORUS\nList thou the deed!

I now stand here,\nMade glad, made sad with blood, exulting, wailing—\nHear, O thou woven web that slew my sire!\nI grieve for deed and death and all my home—\nVictor, pollution’s damnèd stain for prize.\nCHORUS\nAlas, that none of mortal men\nCan pass his life untouched by pain!\nBehold, one woe is here—\nAnother loometh near.\nORESTES\nHark ye and learn—for what the end shall be\nFor me I know not: breaking from the curb\nMy spirit whirls me off, a conquered prey,\nBorne as a charioteer by steeds distraught\nFar from the course, and madness in my breast\nBurneth to chant its song, and leap, and rave—\nHark ye and learn, friends, ere my reason goes!\nI say that rightfully I slew my mother,\nA thing God-scorned, that foully slew my sire\nAnd chiefest wizard of the spell that bound me\nUnto this deed I name the Pythian seer\nApollo, who foretold that if I slew,\nThe guilt of murder done should pass from me;\nBut if I spared, the fate that should be mine\nI dare not blazon forth—the bow of speech\nCan reach not to the mark, that doom to tell.\nAnd now behold me, how with branch and crown\nI pass, a suppliant made meet to go\nUnto Earth’s midmost shrine, the holy ground\nOf Loxias, and that renownèd light\nOf ever-burning fire, to ’scape the doom\nOf kindred murder: to no other shrine\n(So Loxias bade) may I for refuge turn.\nBear witness, Argives, in the after time,\nHow came on me this dread fatality.\nLiving, I pass a banished wanderer hence,\nTo leave in death the memory of this cry.\nCHORUS\nNay, but the deed is well; link not thy lips\nTo speech ill-starred, nor vent ill-boding words—\nWho hast to Argos her full freedom given,\nLopping two serpents’ heads with timely blow.\nORESTES\nLook, look, alas!\nHandmaidens, see—what Gorgon shapes throng up;\nDusky their robes and all their hair enwound—\nSnakes coiled with snakes—off, off, I must away!\nCHORUS\nMost loyal of all sons unto thy sire,\nWhat visions thus distract thee? Hold, abide;\nGreat was thy victory, and shalt thou fear?\nORESTES\nThese are no dreams, void shapes of haunting ill,\nBut clear to sight my mother’s hell-hounds come!\nCHORUS\nNay, the fresh bloodshed still imbrues thine hands,\nAnd thence distraction sinks into thy soul.\nORESTES\nO king Apollo—see, they swarm and throng—\nBlack blood of hatred dripping from their eyes!\nCHORUS\nOne remedy thou hast; go, touch the shrine\nOf Loxias, and rid thee of these woes.\nORESTES\nYe can behold them not, but I behold them.\nUp and away! I dare abide no more.\n[Exit\nCHORUS\nFarewell then as thou mayst,—the god thy friend\nGuard thee and aid with chances favouring.\nBehold, the storm of woe divine\nThat the raves and beats on Atreus’ line\nIts great third blast hath blown.\nFirst was Thyestes’ loathly woe—\nThe rueful feast of long ago,\nOn children’s flesh, unknown.\nAnd next the kingly chief’s despite,\nWhen he who led the Greeks to fight\nWas in the bath hewn down.\nAnd now the offspring of the race\nStands in the third, the saviour’s place,\nTo save—or to consume?\nO whither, ere it be fulfilled,\nEre its fierce blast be hushed and stilled,\nShall blow the wind of doom?\n[Exeunt.]",

She, in after time,\nGave o’er the throne, as birthgift to a god,\nPhoebus, who in his own bears Phoebe’s name.\nHe from the lake and ridge of Delos’ isle\nSteered to the port of Pallas’ Attic shores,\nThe home of ships; and thence he passed and came\nUnto this land and to Parnassus’ shrine.\nAnd at his side, with awe revering him,\nThere went the children of Hephaestus’ seed,\nThe hewers of the sacred way, who tame\nThe stubborn tract that erst was wilderness.\nAnd all this folk, and Delphos, chieftain-king\nOf this their land, with honour gave him home;\nAnd in his breast Zeus set a prophet’s soul,\nAnd gave to him this throne, whereon he sits,\nFourth prophet of the shrine, and, Loxias hight,\nGives voice to that which Zeus his sire decrees.\nSuch gods I name in my preluding prayer,\nAnd after them, I call with honour due\nOn Pallas, wardress of the fane, and Nymphs\nWho dwell around the rock Corycian,\nWhere in the hollow cave, the wild birds’ haunt,\nWander the feet of lesser gods; and there,\nRight well I know it, Bromian Bacchus dwells,\nSince he in godship led his Maenad host,\nDevising death for Pentheus, whom they rent\nPiecemeal, as hare among the hounds. And last,\nI call on Pleistus’ springs, Poseidon’s might,\nAnd Zeus most high, the great Accomplisher.\nThen as a seeress to the sacred chair\nI pass and sit; and may the powers divine\nMake this mine entrance fruitful in response\nBeyond each former advent, triply blest.\nAnd if there stand without, from Hellas bound,\nMen seeking oracles, let each pass in\nIn order of the lot, as use allows;\nFor the god guides whate’er my tongue proclaims.\n[She goes into the interior of the temple; after a short interval, she returns in great fear.\nThings fell to speak of, fell for eyes to see,\nHave sped me forth again from Loxias’ shrine,\nWith strength unstrung, moving erect no more,\nBut aiding with my hands my failing feet,\nUnnerved by fear. A beldame’s force is naught—\nIs as a child’s, when age and fear combine.\nFor as I pace towards the inmost fane\nBay-filleted by many a suppliant’s hand,\nLo, at the central altar I descry\nOne crouching as for refuge—yea, a man\nAbhorredd of heaven; and from his hands, wherein\nA sword new-drawn he holds, blood reeked and fell:\nA wand he bears, the olive’s topmost bough,\nTwined as of purpose with a deep close tuft\nOf whitest wool. This, that I plainly saw,\nPlainly I tell. But lo, in front of him,\nCrouched on the altar-steps, a grisly band\nOf women slumbers—not like women they,\nBut Gorgons rather; nay, that word is weak,\nNor may I match the Gorgons’ shape with theirs!\nSuch have I seen in painted semblance erst—\nWinged Harpies, snatching food from Phineus’ board,—\nBut these are wingless, black, and all their shape\nThe eye’s abomination to behold.\nFell is the breath—let none draw nigh to it—\nWherewith they snort in slumber; from their eyes\nExude the damnèd drops of poisonous ire:\nAnd such their garb as none should dare to bring\nTo statues of the gods or homes of men.\nI wot not of the tribe wherefrom can come\nSo fell a legion, nor in what land Earth\nCould rear, unharmed, such creatures, nor avow\nThat she had travailed and brought forth death.\nBut, for the rest, be all these things a care\nUnto the mighty Loxias, the lord\nOf this our shrine: healer and prophet he,\nDiscerner he of portents, and the cleanser\nOf other homes—behold, his own to cleanse!\n[Exit.\n[The scene opens, disclosing the interior of the temple: Orestes clings to the central altar; the Furies lie slumbering at a little distance; Apollo and Hermes appear from the innermost shrine.\nAPOLLO\nLo, I desert thee never: to the end,\nHard at thy side as now, or sundered far,\nI am thy guard, and to thine enemies\nImplacably oppose me: look on them,\nThese greedy fiends, beneath my craft subdued!\nSee, they are fallen on sleep, these beldames old,\nUnto whose grim and wizened maidenhood\nNor god nor man nor beast can e’er draw near.\nYea, evil were they born, for evil’s doom,\nEvil the dark abyss of Tartarus\nWherein they dwell, and they themselves the hate\nOf men on earth, and of Olympian gods.\nBut thou, flee far and with unfaltering speed;\nFor they shall hunt thee through the mainland wide\nWhere’er throughout the tract of travelled earth\nThy foot may roam, and o’er and o’er the seas\nAnd island homes of men. Faint not nor fail,\nToo soon and timidly within thy breast\nShepherding thoughts forlorn of this thy toil;\nBut unto Pallas’ city go, and there\nCrouch at her shrine, and in thine arms enfold\nHer ancient image: there we well shall find\nMeet judges for this cause and suasive pleas,\nSkilled to contrive for thee deliverance\nFrom all this woe. Be such my pledge to thee,\nFor by my hest thou didst thy mother slay.\nORESTES\nO king Apollo, since right well thou know’st\nWhat justice bids, have heed, fulfil the same,—\nThy strength is all-sufficient to achieve.\nAPOLLO\nHave thou too heed, nor let thy fear prevail\nAbove thy will. And do thou guard him, Hermes,\nWhose blood is brother unto mine, whose sire\nThe same high God. Men call thee guide and guard,\nGuide therefore thou and guard my suppliant;\nFor Zeus himself reveres the outlaw’s right,\nBoon of fair escort, upon man conferred.\n[Exeunt Apollo, Hermes, and Orestes. The Ghost of Clytemnestra near\nGHOST OF CLYTEMNESTRA\nSleep on! awake! what skills your sleep to me—\nMe, among all the dead by you dishonoured—\nMe from whom never, in the world of death,\nDieth this curse, ’Tis she who smote and slew,\nAnd shamed and scorned I roam? Awake, and hear\nMy plaint of dead men’s hate intolerable.\nMe, sternly slain by them that should have loved,\nMe doth no god arouse him to avenge,\nHewn down in blood by matricidal hands.\nMark ye these wounds from which the heart’s blood ran,\nAnd by whose hand, bethink ye! for the sense\nWhen shut in sleep hath then the spirit-sight,\nBut in the day the inward eye is blind.\nList, ye who drank so oft with lapping tongue\nThe wineless draught by me outpoured to soothe\nYour vengeful ire! how oft on kindled shrine\nI laid the feast of darkness, at the hour\nAbhorred of every god but you alone!\nLo, all my service trampled down and scorned!\nAnd he hath baulked your chase, as stag the hounds;\nYea, lightly bounding from the circling toils,\nHath wried his face in scorn, and flieth far.\nAwake and hear—for mine own soul I cry—\nAwake, ye powers of hell! the wandering ghost\nThat once was Clytemnestra calls—Arise!\n[The Furies mutter grimly, as in a dream.\nMutter and murmur! He hath flown afar— My kin have gods to guard them, I have none!\n[The Furies mutter as before.\nO drowsed in sleep too deep to heed my pain!\nOrestes flies, who me, his mother, slew.\n[The Furies give a confused cry.\nYelping, and drowsed again? Up and be doing\nThat which alone is yours, the deed of hell!\n[The Furies give another cry.\nLo, sleep and toil, the sworn confederates,\nHave quelled your dragon-anger, once so fell!\nTHE FURIES (muttering more fiercely and loudly)\nSeize, seize, seize, seize—mark, yonder!\nGHOST\nIn dreams ye chase a prey, and like some hound,\nThat even in sleep doth ply his woodland toil,\nYe bell and bay. What do ye, sleeping here?\nBe not o’ercome with toil, nor sleep-subdued,\nBe heedless of my wrong. Up! thrill your heart\nWith the just chidings of my tongue,—such words\nAre as a spur to purpose firmly held.\nBlow forth on him the breath of wrath and blood,\nScorch him with reek of fire that burns in you,\nWaste him with new pursuit—swift, hound him down!\n[Ghost sinks.\nFIRST FURY (awaking)\nUp! rouse another as I rouse thee; up!\nSleep’st thou? Rise up, and spurning sleep away,\nSee we if false to us this prelude rang.\nCHORUS OF FURIES\nAlack, alack, O sisters, we have toiled,\nO much and vainly have we toiled and borne!\nVainly! and all we wrought the gods have foiled,\nAnd turnèd us to scorn!\nHe hath slipped from the net, whom we chased: he\nhath ’scaped us who should be our prey—\nO’ermastered by slumber we sank, and our quarry hath stolen away!\nThou, child of the high God Zeus, Apollo, hast robbed us and wronged;\nThou, a youth, hast down-trodden the right that is godship more ancient belonged;\nThou hast cherished thy suppliant man; the slayer the God-forsaken,\nThe bane of a parent, by craft from out of our grasp thou hast taken:\nA god, thou hast stolen from us the avengers a matricide son—\nAnd who shall consider thy deed and say, It is rightfully done?\nThe sound of chiding scorn\nCame from the land of dream;\nDeep to mine inmost heart I felt it thrill and burn,\nThrust as a strong-grasped goad, to urge\nOnward the chariot’s team.\nThrilled, chilled with bitter inward pain\nI stand as one beneath the doomsman’s scourge.\nShame on the younger gods who tread down right,\nSitting on thrones of might!\nWoe on the altar of earth’s central fane!\nClotted on step and shrine,\nBehold, the guilt of blood, the ghastly stain!\nWoe upon thee, Apollo! uncontrolled,\nUnbidden, hast thou, prophet-god, imbrued\nThe pure prophetic shrine with wrongful blood!\nFor thou too heinous a respect didst hold\nOf man, too little heed of powers divine!\nAnd us the Fates, the ancients of the earth,\nDidst deem as nothing worth.\nScornful to me thou art, yet shalt not fend\nMy wrath from him; though unto hell he flee,\nThere too are we!\nAnd he the blood defiled, should feel and rue,\nThough I were not, fiend-wrath that shall not end,\nDescending on his head who foully slew.\n[Re-enter Apollo from the inner shrine.\nAPOLLO\nOut! I command you. Out from this my home—\nHaste, tarry not! Out from the mystic shrine,\nLest thy lot be to take into thy breast\nThe winged bright dart that from my golden string\nSpeeds hissing as a snake,—lest, pierced and thrilled\nWith agony, thou shouldst spew forth again\nBlack frothy heart’s-blood, drawn from mortal men,\nBelching the gory clots sucked forth from wounds.\nThese be no halls where such as you can prowl—\nGo where men lay on men the doom of blood,\nHeads lopped from necks, eyes from their spheres plucked out,\nHacked flesh, the flower of youthful seed crushed out,\nFeet hewn away, and hands, and death beneath\nThe smiting stone, low moans and piteous\nOf men impaled—Hark, hear ye for what feast\nYe hanker ever, and the loathing gods\nDo spit upon your craving? Lo, your shape\nIs all too fitted to your greed; the cave\nWhere lurks some lion, lapping gore, were home\nMore meet for you. Avaunt from sacred shrines,\nNor bring pollution by your touch on all\nThat nears you. Hence! and roam unshepherded—\nNo god there is to tend such herd as you.\nCHORUS\nO king Apollo, in our turn hear us.\nThou hast’not only part in these ill things,\nBut art chief cause and doer of the same.\nAPOLLO\nHow? stretch thy speech to tell this, and have done.\nCHORUS\nThine oracle bade this man slay his mother.\nAPOLLO\nI bade him quit his sire’s death,—wherefore not?\nCHORUS\nThen didst thou aid and guard red-handed crime.\nAPOLLO\nYea, and I bade him to this temple flee.\nCHORUS\nAnd yet forsooth dost chide us following him!\nAPOLLO\nAy—not for you it is, to near this fane.\nCHORUS\nYet is such office ours, imposed by fate.\nAPOLLO\nWhat office? vaunt the thing ye deem so fair.\nCHORUS\nFrom home to home we chase the matricide.\nAPOLLO\nWhat? to avenge a wife who slays her lord?\nCHORUS\nThat is not blood outpoured by kindred hands.\nAPOLLO\nHow darkly ye dishonour and annul\nThe troth to which the high accomplishers,\nHera and Zeus, do honour. Yea, and thus\nIs Aphrodite to dishonour cast,\nThe queen of rapture unto mortal men.\nKnow, that above the marriage-bed ordained\nFor man and woman standeth Right as guard,\nEnhancing sanctity of troth-plight sworn;\nTherefore, if thou art placable to those\nWho have their consort slain, nor will’st to turn\nOn them the eye of wrath, unjust art thou\nIn hounding to his doom the man who slew\nHis mother. Lo, I know thee full of wrath\nAgainst one deed, but all too placable\nUnto the other, minishing the crime.\nBut in this cause shall Pallas guard the right.\nCHORUS\nDeem not my quest shall ever quit that man.\nAPOLLO\nFollow then, make thee double toil in vain!\nCHORUS\nThink not by speech mine office to curtail.\nAPOLLO\nNone hast thou, that I would accept of thee!\nCHORUS\nYea, high thine honour by the throne of Zeus:\nBut I, drawn on by scent of mother’s blood,\nSeek vengeance on this man and hound him down.\nAPOLLO\nBut I will stand beside him; ’tis for me\nTo guard my suppliant: gods and men alike\nDo dread the curse of such an one betrayed,\nAnd in me Fear and Will say Leave him not.\n[Exeunt omnes]",

    "content":"The scene changes to Athens. In the foreground, the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis; her statue stands in the centre; Orestes is seen clinging to it.\nORESTES\nLook on me, queen Athena; lo, I come\nBy Loxias’ behest; thou of thy grace\nReceive me, driven of avenging powers—\nNot now a red-hand slayer unannealed,\nBut with guilt fading, half-effaced, outworn\nOn many homes and paths of mortal men.\nFor to the limit of each land, each sea,\nI roamed, obedient to Apollo’s hest,\nAnd come at last, O Goddess, to thy fane,\nAnd clinging to thine image, bide my doom.\n[Enter the Chorus of Furies, questing like hounds\nCHORUS\nHo! clear is here the trace of him we seek:\nFollow the track of blood, the silent sign!\nLike to some hound that hunts a wounded fawn,\nWe snuff along the scent of dripping gore,\nAnd inwardly we pant, for many a day\nToiling in chase that shall fordo the man;\nFor o’er and o’er the wide land have I ranged,\nAnd o’er the wide sea, flying without wings,\nSwift as a sail I pressed upon his track,\nWho now hard by is crouching, well I wot,\nFor scent of mortal blood allures me here.\nFollow, seek him—round and round\nScent and snuff and scan the ground,\nLest unharmed he slip away,\nHe who did his mother slay!\nHist—he is there! See him his arms entwine\nAround the image of the maid divine—\nThus aided, for the deed he wrought\nUnto the judgment wills he to be brought.\nIt may not be! a mother’s blood, poured forth\nUpon the stainèd earth,\nNone gathers up: it lies—bear witness, Hell!—\nFor aye indelible!\nAnd thou who sheddest it shalt give thine own\nThat shedding to atone!\nYea, from thy living limbs I suck it out,\nRed, clotted, gout by gout,—\nA draught abhorred of men and gods; but I\nWill drain it, suck thee dry;\nYea, I will waste thee living, nerve and vein;\nYea, for thy mother slain,\nWill drag thee downward, there where thou shalt dree\nThe weird of agony!\nAnd thou and whatsoe’er of men hath sinned—\nHath wronged or God, or friend,\nOr parent,—learn ye how to all and each\nThe arm of doom can reach!\nSternly requiteth, in the world beneath,\nThe judgment-seat of Death;\nYea, Death, beholding every man’s endeavour\nRecordeth it for ever.\nORESTES\nI, schooled in many miseries, have learnt\nHow many refuges of cleansing shrines\nThere be; I know when law alloweth speech\nAnd when imposeth silence. Lo, I stand\nFixed now to speak, for he whose word is wise\nCommands the same. Look, how the stain of blood\nIs dull upon mine hand and wastes away,\nAnd laved and lost therewith is the deep curse\nOf matricide; for while the guilt was new,\n’Twas banished from me at Apollo’s hearth,\nAtoned and purified by death of swine.\nLong were my word if I should sum the tale,\nHow oft since then among my fellow-men\nI stood and brought no curse. Time cleanses all—\nTime, the coeval of all things that are.\nNow from pure lips, in words of omen fair,\nI call Athena, lady of this land,\nTo come, my champion: so, in aftertime,\nShe shall not fail of love and service leal,\nNot won by war, from me and from my land,\nAnd all the folk of Argos, vowed to her.\nNow, be she far away in Libyan land\nWhere flows from Triton’s lake her natal wave,—\nStand she with planted feet, or in some hour\nOf rest conceal them, champion of her friends\nWhere’er she be,—or whether o’er the plain\nPhlegraean she look forth, as warrior bold—\nI cry to her to come, where’er she be,\n(And she, as goddess, from afar can hear,)\nAnd aid and free me, set among my foes.\nCHORUS\nThee not Apollo nor Athena’s strength\nCan save from perishing, a castaway\nAmid the Lost, where no delight shall meet\nThy soul—a bloodless prey of nether powers,\nA shadow among shadows. Answerest thou\nNothing? dost cast away my words with scorn,\nThou, prey prepared and dedicate to me?\nNot as a victim slain upon the shrine,\nBut living shalt thou see thy flesh my food.\nHear now the binding chant that makes thee mine.\nWeave the weird dance,—behold the hour\nTo utter forth the chant of hell,\nOur sway among mankind to tell,\nThe guidance of our power.\nOf Justice are we ministers,\nAnd whosoe’er of men may stand\nLifting a pure unsullied hand,\nThat man no doom of ours incurs,\nAnd walks thro’ all his mortal path\nUntouched by woe, unharmed by wrath.\nBut if, as yonder man, he hath\nBlood on the hands he strives to hide,\nWe stand avengers at his side,\nDecreeing, Thou hast wronged the dead:\nWe are doom’s witnesses to thee.\nThe price of blood, his hands have shed,\nWe wring from him; in life, in death,\nHard at his side are we!\nNight, Mother Night, who brought me forth, a torment\nTo living men and dead,\nHear me, O hear! by Leto’s stripling son\nI am dishonourèd:\nHe hath ta’en from me him who cowers in refuge,\nTo me made consecrate,—\nA rightful victim, him who slew his mother.\nGiven o’er to me and fate.\nHear the hymn of hell,\nO’er the victim sounding,—\nChant of frenzy, chant of ill,\nSense and will confounding!\nRound the soul entwining\nWithout lute or lyre—\nSoul in madness pining,\nWasting as with fire!\nFate, all-pervading Fate, this service spun, commanding\nThat I should bide therein:\nWhosoe’er of mortals, made perverse and lawless,\nIs stained with blood of kin,\nBy his side are we, and hunt him ever onward,\nTill to the Silent Land,\nThe realm of death, he cometh; neither yonder\nIn freedom shall he stand.\nHear the hymn of hell,\nO’er the victim sounding,—\nChant of frenzy, chant of ill,\nSense and will confounding!\nRound the soul entwining\nWithout lute or lyre—\nSoul in madness pining,\nWasting as with fire!\nWhen from womb of Night we sprang, on us this labour\nWas laid and shall abide.\nGods immortal are ye, yet beware ye touch not\nThat which is our pride!\nNone may come beside us gathered round the blood feast—\nFor us no garments white\nGleam on a festal day; for us a darker fate is,\nAnother darker rite.\nThat is mine hour when falls an ancient line—\nWhen in the household’s heart\nThe god of blood doth slay by kindred hands,—\nThen do we bear our part:\nOn him who slays we sweep with chasing cry:\nThough he be triply strong,\nWe wear and waste him; blood atones for blood,\nNew pain for ancient wrong.\nI hold this task—’tis mine, and not another’s.\nThe very gods on high,\nThough they can silence and annul the prayers\nOf those who on us cry,\nThey may not strive with us who stand apart,\nA race by Zeus abhorred,\nBlood-boltered, held unworthy of the council\nAnd converse of Heaven’s lord.\nTherefore the more I leap upon my prey;\nUpon their head I bound;\nMy foot is hard; as one that trips a runner\nI cast them to the ground;\nYea, to the depth of doom intolerable;\nAnd they who erst were great,\nAnd upon earth held high their pride and glory,\nAre brought to low estate.\nIn underworld they waste and are diminished,\nThe while around them fleet\nDark wavings of my robes, and, subtly woven,\nThe paces of my feet.\nWho falls infatuate, he sees not, neither knows he\nThat we are at his side;\nSo closely round about him, darkly flitting,\nThe cloud of guilt doth glide.\nHeavily ’tis uttered, how around his hearthstone\nThe mirk of hell doth rise.\nStern and fixed the law is; we have hands t’achieve it,\nCunning to devise.\nQueens are we and mindful of our solemn vengeance.\nNot by tear or prayer\nShall a man avert it. In unhonoured darkness,\nFar from gods, we fare,\nLit unto our task with torch of sunless regions,\nAnd o’er a deadly way—\nDeadly to the living as to those who see not\nLife and light of day—\nHunt we and press onward. Who of mortals hearing\nDoth not quake for awe,\nHearing all that Fate thro’ hand of God hath given us\nFor ordinance and law?\nYea, this right to us, in dark abysm and backward\nOf ages it befel:\nNone shall wrong mine office, tho’ in nether regions\nAnd sunless dark I dwell.\n[Enter Athena from above.\nATHENA\nFar off I heard the clamour of your cry,\nAs by Scamander’s side I set my foot\nAsserting right upon the land given o’er\nTo me by those who o’er Achaia’s host\nHeld sway and leadership: no scanty part\nOf all they won by spear and sword, to me\nThey gave it, land and all that grew theron,\nAs chosen heirloom for my Theseus’ clan.\nThence summoned, sped I with a tireless foot,—\nHummed on the wind, instead of wings, the fold\nOf this mine aegis, by my feet propelled,\nAs, linked to mettled horses, speeds a car.\nAnd now, beholding here Earth’s nether brood,\nI fear it nought, yet are mine eyes amazed\nWith wonder. Who are ye? of all I ask,\nAnd of this stranger to my statue clinging.\nBut ye—your shape is like no human form,\nLike to no goddess whom the gods behold,\nLike to no shape which mortal women wear.\nYet to stand by and chide a monstrous form\nIs all unjust—from such words Right revolts.\nCHORUS\nO child of Zeus, one word shall tell thee all.\nWe are the children of eternal Night,\nAnd Furies in the underworld are called.\nATHENA\nI know your lineage now and eke your name.\nCHORUS\nYea, and eftsoons indeed my rights shalt know.\nATHENA\nFain would I learn them; speak them clearly forth.\nCHORUS\nWe chase from home the murderers of men.\nATHENA\nAnd where at last can he that slew make pause?\nCHORUS\nWhere this is law—All joy abandon here.\nATHENA\nSay, do ye bay this man to such a flight?\nCHORUS\nYea, for of choice he did his mother slay.\nATHENA\nUrged by no fear of other wrath and doom?\nCHORUS\nWhat spur can rightly goad to matricide?\nATHENA\nTwo stand to plead—one only have I heard.\nCHORUS\nHe will not swear nor challenge us to oath.\nATHENA\nThe form of justice, not its deed, thou willest.\nCHORUS\nProve thou that word; thou art not scant of skill.\nATHENA\nI say that oaths shall not enforce the wrong.\nCHORUS\nThen test the cause, judge and award the right.\nATHENA\nWill ye to me then this decision trust?\nCHORUS\nYea, reverencing true child of worthy sire.\nATHENA (to Orestes)\nO man unknown, make thou thy plea in turn.\nSpeak forth thy land, thy lineage, and thy woes;\nThen, if thou canst, avert this bitter blame—\nIf, as I deem, in confidence of right\nThou sittest hard beside my holy place,\nClasping this statue, as Ixion sat,\nA sacred suppliant for Zeus to cleanse,—\nTo all this answer me in words made plain.\nORESTES\nO queen Athena, first from thy last words\nWill I a great solicitude remove.\nNot one blood-guilty am I; no foul stain\nClings to thine image from my clinging hand;\nWhereof one potent proof I have to tell.\nLo, the law stands—The slayer shall not plead,\nTill by the hand of him who cleanses blood\nA suckling creature’s blood besprinkle him.\nLong since have I this expiation done,—\nIn many a home, slain beasts and running streams\nHave cleansed me.

    "content":"THE PERSIANS\nARGUMENT\nXerxes, son of Darius and of his wife Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, went forth against Hellas, to take vengeance upon those who had defeated his father at Marathon. But ill fortune befell the king and his army both by land and sea; neither did it avail him that he cast a bridge over the Hellespont and made a canal across the promontory of Mount Athos, and brought myriads of men, by land and sea, to subdue the Greeks. For in the strait between Athens and the island of Salamis the Persian ships were shattered and sunk or put to flight by those of Athens and Lacedaemon and Aegina and Corinth, and Xerxes went homewards on the way by which he had come, leaving his general Mardonius with three hundred thousand men to strive with the Greeks by land: but in the next year they were destroyed near Plataea in Boeotia, by the Lacedaemonians and Athenians and Tegeans. Such was the end of the army which Xerxes left behind him. But the king himself had reached the bridge over the Hellespont, and late and hardly and in sorry plight and with few companions came home unto the Palace of Susa.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nCHORUS OF PERSIAN ELDERS.\nATOSSA, WIDOW OF DARIUS AND MOTHER OF XERXES.\nA MESSENGER.\nTHE GHOST OF DARIUS.\nXERXES.\nThe Scene is laid at the Palace of Susa.\nCHORUS.\nAway unto the Grecian land\nHath passed the Persian armament:\nWe, by the monarch’s high command,\nWe are the warders true who stand,\nChosen, for honour and descent,\nTo watch the wealth of him who went—\nGuards of the gold, and faithful styled\nBy Xerxes, great Darius’ child!\nBut the king went nor comes again—\nAnd for that host, we saw depart\nArrayed in gold, my boding heart\nAches with a pulse of anxious pain,\nPresageful for its youthful king!\nNo scout, no steed, no battle-car\nComes speeding hitherward, to bring\nNews to our city from afar!\nErewhile they went, away, away,\nFrom Susa, from Ecbatana,\nFrom Kissa’s timeworn fortress grey,\nPassing to ravage and to war—\nSome upon steeds, on galleys some,\nSome in close files, they passed from home,\nAll upon warlike errand bent—\nAmistres, Artaphernes went,\nAstaspes, Megabazes high,\nLords of the Persian chivalry,\nMarshals who serve the great king’s word\nChieftains of all the mighty horde!\nHorsemen and bowmen streamed away,\nGrim in their aspect, fixed to slay,\nAnd resolute to face the fray!\nWith troops of horse, careering fast,\nMasistes, Artembáres passed:\nImaeus too, the bowman brave,\nSosthánes, Pharandákes, drave—\nAnd others the all-nursing wave\nOf Nilus to the battle gave;\nCame Susiskánes, warrior wild,\nAnd Pegastágon, Egypt’s child:\nThee, brave Arsámes! from afar\nDid holy Memphis launch to war;\nAnd Ariomardus, high in fame,\nFrom Thebes the immemorial came,\nAnd oarsmen skilled from Nilus’ fen,\nA countless crowd of warlike men:\nAnd next, the dainty Lydians went—\nSoft rulers of a continent—\nMitragathes and Arcteus bold\nIn twin command their ranks controlled,\nAnd Sardis town, that teems with gold,\nSent forth its squadrons to the war—\nHorse upon horse, and car on car,\nDouble and triple teams, they rolled,\nIn onset awful to behold.\nFrom Tmolus’ sacred hill there came\nThe native hordes to join the fray,\nAnd upon Hellas’ neck to lay\nThe yoke of slavery and shame;\nMardon and Tharubis were there,\nBright anvils for the foemen’s spear!\nThe Mysian dart-men sped to war,\nAnd the long crowd that onward rolled\nFrom Babylon enriched with gold—\nCaptains of ships and archers skilled\nTo speed the shaft, and those who wield\nThe scimitar;—the eastern band\nWho, by the great king’s high command,\nSwept to subdue the western land!\nGone are they, gone—ah, welladay!\nThe flower and pride of our array;\nAnd all the Eastland, from whose breast\nCame forth her bravest and her best,\nCraves longingly with boding dread—\nParents for sons, and brides new-wed\nFor absent lords, and, day by day,\nShudder with dread at their delay!\nEre now they have passed o’er the sea, the manifold host of the king—\nThey have gone forth to sack and to burn; ashore on the Westland they spring!\nWith cordage and rope they have bridged the sea-way of Helle, to pass\nO’er the strait that is named by thy name, O daughter of Athamas!\nThey have anchored their ships in the current, they have bridled the neck of the sea—\nThe Shepherd and Lord of the East hath bidden a roadway to be!\nFrom the land to the land they pass over, a herd at the high king’s best;\nSome by the way of the waves, and some o’er the planking have pressed.\nFor the king is a lord and a god: he was born of the golden seed\nThat erst upon Danae fell—his captains are strong at the need!\nAnd dark is the glare of his eyes, as eyes of a serpent blood-fed,\nAnd with manifold troops in his train and with manifold ships hath he sped—\nYea, sped with his Syrian cars: he leads on the lords of the bow\nTo meet with the men of the West, the spear-armed force of the foe!\nCan any make head and resist him, when he comes with the roll of a wave?\nNo barrier nor phalanx of might, no chief, be he ever so brave!\nFor stern is the onset of Persia, and gallant her children in fight.\nBut the guile of the god is deceitful, and who shall elude him by flight?\nAnd who is the lord of the leap, that can spring and alight and evade?\nFor Até deludes and allures, till round him the meshes are laid,\nAnd no man his doom can escape! it was writ in the rule of high Heaven,\nThat in tramp of the steeds and in crash of the charge the war-cry of Persia be given:\nThey have learned to behold the forbidden, the sacred enclosure of sea,\nWhere the waters are wide and in stress of the wind the billows roll hoary to lee!\nAnd their trust is in cable and cordage, too weak in the power of the blast,\nAnd frail are the links of the bridge whereby unto Hellas they passed.\nTherefore my gloom-wrapped heart is rent with sorrow\nFor what may hap to-morrow!\nAlack, for all the Persian armament—\nAlack, lest there be sent\nDread news of desolation, Susa’s land\nBereft, forlorn, unmanned—\nLest the grey Kissian fortress echo back\nThe wail, Alack, Alack!\nThe sound of women’s shriek, who wail and mourn,\nWith fine-spun raiment torn!\nThe charioteers went forth nor come again,\nAnd all the marching men\nEven as a swarm of bees have flown afar,\nDrawn by the king to war—\nCrossing the sea-bridge, linked from side to side,\nThat doth the waves divide:\nAnd the soft bridal couch of bygone years\nIs now bedewed with tears,\nEach princess, clad in garments delicate,\nWails for her widowed fate—\nAlas my gallant bridegroom, lost and gone,\nAnd I am left alone!\nBut now, ye warders of the state,\nHere, in this hall of old renown,\nBehoves that we deliberate\nIn counsel deep and wise debate,\nFor need is surely shown!\nHow fareth he, Darius’ child,\nThe Persian king, from Perseus styled?\nComes triumph to the eastern bow,\nOr hath the lance-point conquered now?\nEnter ATOSSA.\nSee, yonder comes the mother-queen,\nLight of our eyes, in godlike sheen,\nThe royal mother of the king!—\nFall we before her! well it were\nThat, all as one, we sue to her,\nAnd round her footsteps cling!\nQueen, among deep-girded Persian dames thou highest and most royal,\nHoary mother, thou, of Xerxes, and Darius’ wife of old!\nTo godlike sire, and godlike son, we bow us and are loyal—\nUnless, on us, an adverse tide of destiny has rolled!\nATOSSA.\nTherefore come I forth to you, from chambers decked and golden,\nWhere long ago Darius laid his head, with me beside,\nAnd my heart is torn with anguish, and with terror am I holden,\nAnd I plead unto your friendship and I bid you to my side.\nDarius, in the old time, by aid of some Immortal,\nRaised up the stately fabric, our wealth of long-ago:\nBut I tremble lest it totter down, and ruin porch and portal,\nAnd the whirling dust of downfall rise above its overthrow!\nTherefore a dread unspeakable within me never slumbers,\nSaying, Honour not the gauds of wealth if men have ceased to grow,\nNor deem that men, apart from wealth, can find their strength in numbers—\nWe shudder for our light and king, though we have gold enow!\nNo light there is, in any house, save presence of the master—\nSo runs the saw, ye aged men! and truth it says indeed—\nOn you I call, the wise and true, to ward us from disaster,\nFor all my hope is fixed on you, to prop us in our need!\nCHORUS.\nQueen-Mother of the Persian land, to thy commandment bowing,\nWhate’er thou wilt, in word or deed, we follow to fulfil—\nNot twice we need thine high behest, our faith and duty knowing,\nIn council and in act alike, thy loyal servants still!\nATOSSA.\nLong while by various visions of the night\nAm I beset, since to Ionian lands\nWith marshalled host my son went forth to war.\nYet never saw I presage so distinct\nAs in the night now passed.—Attend my tale!—\nA dream I had: two women nobly clad\nCame to my sight, one robed in Persian dress,\nThe other vested in the Dorian garb,\nAnd both right stately and more tall by far\nThan women of to-day, and beautiful\nBeyond disparagement, and sisters sprung\nBoth of one race, but, by their natal lot,\nOne born in Hellas, one in Eastern land.\nThese, as it seemed unto my watching eyes,\nRoused each the other to a mutual feud:\nThe which my son perceiving set himself\nTo check and soothe their struggle, and anon\nYoked them and set the collars on their necks;\nAnd one, the Ionian, proud in this array,\nPaced in high quietude, and lent her mouth,\nObedient, to the guidance of the rein.\nBut restively the other strove, and broke\nThe fittings of the car, and plunged away\nWith mouth un-bitted: o’er the broken yoke\nMy son was hurled, and lo! Darius stood\nIn lamentation o’er his fallen child.\nHim Xerxes saw, and rent his robe in grief.\nSuch was my vision of the night now past;\nBut when, arising, I had dipped my hand\nIn the fair lustral stream, I drew towards\nThe altar, in the act of sacrifice,\nHaving in mind to offer, as their due,\nThe sacred meal-cake to the averting powers,\nLords of the rite that banisheth ill dreams.\nWhen lo! I saw an eagle fleeing fast\nTo Phoebus’ shrine—O friends, I stayed my steps,\nToo scared to speak! for, close upon his flight,\nA little falcon dashed in winged pursuit,\nPlucking with claws the eagle’s head, while he\nCould only crouch and cower and yield himself.\nScared was I by that sight, and eke to you\nNo less a terror must it be to hear!\nFor mark this well—if Xerxes have prevailed,\nHe shall come back the wonder of the world:\nIf not, still none can call him to account—\nSo he but live, he liveth Persia’s King!\nCHORUS.\nQueen, it stands not with my purpose to abet these fears of thine,\nNor to speak with glazing comfort! nay, betake thee to the shrine!\nIf thy dream foretold disaster, sue to gods to bar its way,\nAnd, for thyself, son, state, and friends, to bring fair fate to-day.\nNext, unto Earth and to the Dead be due libation poured,\nAnd by thee let Darius’ soul be wistfully implored—\nI saw thee, lord, in last night’s dream, a phantom from the grave,\nI pray thee, lord, from earth beneath come forth to help and save!\nTo me and to thy son send up the bliss of triumph now,\nAnd hold the gloomy fates of ill, dim in the dark below!\nSuch be thy words! my inner heart good tidings doth foretell,\nAnd that fair fate will spring thereof, if wisdom guide us well.\nATOSSA.\nLoyal thou that first hast read this dream, this vision of the night,\nWith loyalty to me, the queen—be then thy presage right!\nAnd therefore, as thy bidding is, what time I pass within\nTo dedicate these offerings, new prayers I will begin,\nAlike to gods and the great dead who loved our lineage well.\nYet one more word—say, in what realm do the Athenians dwell?\nCHORUS.\nFar hence, even where, in evening land, goes down our Lord the Sun.\nATOSSA.\nSay, had my son so keen desire, that region to o’errun?\nCHORUS.\nYea—if she fell, the rest of Greece were subject to our sway!\nATOSSA.\nHath she so great predominance, such legions in array?\nCHORUS.\nAy—such a host as smote us sore upon an earlier day.\nATOSSA.\nAnd what hath she, besides her men? enow of wealth in store?\nCHORUS.\nA mine of treasure in the earth, a fount of silver ore!\nATOSSA.\nIs it in skill of bow and shaft that Athens’ men excel?\nCHORUS.\nNay, they bear bucklers in the fight, and thrust the spear-point well.\nATOSSA.\nAnd who is shepherd of their host and holds them in command?\nCHORUS.\nTo no man do they bow as slaves, nor own a master’s hand.\nATOSSA.\nHow should they bide our brunt of war, the East upon the West?\nCHORUS.\nThat could Darius’ valiant horde in days of yore attest!\nATOSSA.\nA boding word, to us who bore the men now far away!\nCHORUS.\nNay—as I deem, the very truth will dawn on us to-day.\nA Persian by his garb and speed, a courier draws anear—\nHe bringeth news, of good or ill, for Persia’s land to hear.\nEnter a MESSENGER.\nMESSENGER.\nO walls and towers of all the Asian realm,\nO Persian land, O treasure-house of gold!\nHow, by one stroke, down to destruction, down,\nHath sunk our pride, and all the flower of war\nThat once was Persia’s, lieth in the dust!\nWoe on the man who first announceth woe—\nYet must I all the tale of death unroll!\nHark to me, Persians! Persia’s host lies low.\nCHORUS.\nO ruin manifold, and woe, and fear!\nLet the wild tears run down, for the great doom is here!\nMESSENGER.\nThis blow hath fallen, to the utterance, And I, past hope, behold my safe return!\nCHORUS.\nToo long, alack, too long this life of mine,\nThat in mine age I see this sudden woe condign!\nMESSENGER.\nAs one who saw, by no loose rumour led,\nLords, I would tell what doom was dealt to us.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, how vainly have they striven!\nOur myriad hordes with shaft and bow\nWent from the Eastland, to lay low\nHellas, beloved of Heaven!\nMESSENGER.\nPiled with men dead, yea, miserably slain,\nIs every beach, each reef of Salamis!\nCHORUS.\nThou sayest sooth—ah well-a-day!\nBattered amid the waves, and torn,\nOn surges hither, thither, borne,\nDead bodies, bloodstained and forlorn,\nIn their long cloaks they toss and stray!\nMESSENGER.\nTheir bows availed not! all have perished, all,\nBy charging galleys crushed and whelmed in death.\nCHORUS.\nShriek out your sorrow’s wistful wail!\nTo their untimely doom they went;\nIll strove they, and to no avail,\nAnd minished is their armament!\nMESSENGER.\nOut on thee, hateful name of Salamis,\nOut upon Athens, mournful memory!\nCHORUS.\nWoe upon this day’s evil fame!\nThou, Athens, art our murderess;\nAlack, full many a Persian dame\nIs left forlorn and husbandless!\nATOSSA.\nMute have I been awhile, and overwrought\nAt this great sorrow, for it passeth speech,\nAnd passeth all desire to ask of it.\nYet if the gods send evils, men must bear.\n(To the MESSENGER)\nUnroll the record! stand composed and tell,\nAlthough thy heart be groaning inwardly,\nWho hath escaped, and, of our leaders, whom\nHave we to weep? what chieftains in the van\nStood, sank, and died and left us leaderless?\nMESSENGER.\nXerxes himself survives and sees the day.\nATOSSA.\nThen to my line thy word renews the dawn\nAnd golden dayspring after gloom of night!\nMESSENGER.\nBut the brave marshal of ten thousand horse,\nArtembares, is tossed and flung in death\nAlong the rugged rocks Silenian.\nAnd Dadaces no longer leads his troop,\nBut, smitten by the spear, from off the prow\nHath lightly leaped to death; and Tenagon,\nIn true descent a Bactrian nobly born,\nDrifts by the sea-lashed reefs of Salamis,\nThe isle of Ajax. Gone Lilaeus too,\nGone are Arsames and Argestes! all,\nAround the islet where the sea-doves breed,\nDashed their defeated heads on iron rocks;\nArcteus, who dwelt beside the founts of Nile,\nAdeues, Pheresseues, and with them\nPharnuchus, from one galley’s deck went down.\nMatallus, too, of Chrysa, lord and king\nOf myriad hordes, who led unto the fight\nThree times ten thousand swarthy cavaliers,\nFell, with his swarthy and abundant beard\nIncarnadined to red, a crimson stain\nOutrivalling the purple of the sea!\nThere Magian Arabus and Artames\nOf Bactra perished—taking up, alike,\nIn yonder stony land their long sojourn.\nAmistris too, and he whose strenuous spear\nWas foremost in the fight, Amphistreus fell,\nAnd gallant Ariomardus, by whose death\nBroods sorrow upon Sardis: Mysia mourns\nFor Seisames, and Tharubis lies low—\nCommander, he, of five times fifty ships,\nBorn in Lyrnessus: his heroic form\nIs low in death, ungraced with sepulchre.\nDead too is he, the lord of courage high,\nCilicia’s marshal, brave Syennesis,\nThan whom none dealt more carnage on the foe,\nNor perished by a more heroic end.\nSo fell the brave: so speak I of their doom,\nSumming in brief the fate of myriads!\nATOSSA.\nAh well-a-day! these crowning woes I hear,\nThe shame of Persia and her shrieks of dole!\nBut yet renew the tale, repeat thy words,\nTell o’er the count of those Hellenic ships,\nAnd how they ventured with their beakèd prows\nTo charge upon the Persian armament.\nMESSENGER.\nKnow, if mere count of ships could win the day,\nThe Persians had prevailed. The Greeks, in sooth,\nHad but three hundred galleys at the most,\nAnd other ten, select and separate.\nBut—I am witness—Xerxes held command\nOf full a thousand keels, and, those apart,\nTwo hundred more, and seven, for speed renowned!—\nSo stands the reckoning, and who shall dare\nTo say we Persians had the lesser host?\nATOSSA.\nNay, we were worsted by an unseen power\nWho swayed the balance downward to our doom!\nMESSENGER.\nIn ward of heaven doth Pallas’ city stand.\nATOSSA.\nHow then? is Athens yet inviolate?\nMESSENGER.\nWhile her men live, her bulwark standeth firm!\nATOSSA.\nSay, how began the struggle of the ships?\nWho first joined issue? did the Greeks attack,\nOr Xerxes, in his numbers confident?\nMESSENGER.\nO queen, our whole disaster thus befell,\nThrough intervention of some fiend or fate—\nI know not what—that had ill will to us.\nFrom the Athenian host some Greek came o’er,\nTo thy son Xerxes whispering this tale—\nOnce let the gloom of night have gathered in,\nThe Greeks will tarry not, but swiftly spring\nEach to his galley-bench, in furtive flight,\nSoftly contriving safety for their life.\nThy son believed the word and missed the craft\nOf that Greek foeman, and the spite of Heaven,\nAnd straight to all his captains gave this charge—\nAs soon as sunlight warms the ground no more,\nAnd gloom enwraps the sanctuary of sky,\nRange we our fleet in triple serried lines\nTo bar the passage from the seething strait,\nThis way and that: let other ships surround\nThe isle of Ajax, with this warning word—\nThat if the Greeks their jeopardy should scape\nBy wary craft, and win their ships a road.\nEach Persian captain shall his failure pay\nBy forfeit of his head. So spake the king,\nInspired at heart with over-confidence,\nUnwitting of the gods’ predestined will.\nThereon our crews, with no disordered haste,\nDid service to his bidding and purveyed\nThe meal of afternoon: each rower then\nOver the fitted rowlock looped his oar.\nThen, when the splendour of the sun had set,\nAnd night drew on, each master of the oar\nAnd each armed warrior straightway went aboard.\nForward the long ships moved, rank cheering rank,\nEach forward set upon its ordered course.\nAnd all night long the captains of the fleet\nKept their crews moving up and down the strait.\nSo the night waned, and not one Grecian ship\nMade effort to elude and slip away.\nBut as dawn came and with her coursers white\nShone in fair radiance over all the earth,\nFirst from the Grecian fleet rang out a cry,\nA song of onset! and the island crags\nRe-echoed to the shrill exulting sound.\nThen on us Eastern men amazement fell\nAnd fear in place of hope; for what we heard\nWas not a call to flight! the Greeks rang out\nTheir holy, resolute, exulting chant,\nLike men come forth to dare and do and die\nTheir trumpets pealed, and fire was in that sound,\nAnd with the dash of simultaneous oars\nReplying to the war-chant, on they came,\nSmiting the swirling brine, and in a trice\nThey flashed upon the vision of the foe!\nThe right wing first in orderly advance\nCame on, a steady column; following then,\nThe rest of their array moved out and on,\nAnd to our ears there came a burst of sound,\nA clamour manifold.—On, sons of Greece!\nOn, for your country’s freedom! strike to save\nWives, children, temples of ancestral gods,\nGraves of your fathers! now is all at stake.\nThen from our side swelled up the mingled din\nOf Persian tongues, and time brooked no delay—\nShip into ship drave hard its brazen beak\nWith speed of thought, a shattering blow! and first\nOne Grecian bark plunged straight, and sheared away\nBowsprit and stem of a Phoenician ship.\nAnd then each galley on some other’s prow\nCame crashing in. Awhile our stream of ships\nHeld onward, till within the narrowing creek\nOur jostling vessels were together driven,\nAnd none could aid another: each on each\nDrave hard their brazen beaks, or brake away\nThe oar-banks of each other, stem to stern,\nWhile the Greek galleys, with no lack of skill,\nHemmed them and battered in their sides, and soon\nThe hulls rolled over, and the sea was hid,\nCrowded with wrecks and butchery of men.\nNo beach nor reef but was with corpses strewn,\nAnd every keel of our barbarian host\nHurried to flee, in utter disarray.\nThereon the foe closed in upon the wrecks\nAnd hacked and hewed, with oars and splintered planks,\nAs fishermen hack tunnies or a cast\nOf netted dolphins, and the briny sea\nRang with the screams and shrieks of dying men,\nUntil the night’s dark aspect hid the scene.\nHad I a ten days’ time to sum that count\nOf carnage, ’twere too little! know this well—\nOne day ne’er saw such myriad forms of death!\nATOSSA.\nWoe on us, woe! disaster’s mighty sea\nHath burst on us and all the Persian realm!\nMESSENGER.\nBe well assured, the tale is but begun—\nThe further agony that on us fell\nDoth twice outweigh the sufferings I have told!\nATOSSA.\nNay, what disaster could be worse than this?\nSay on! what woe upon the army came,\nSwaying the scale to a yet further fall?\nMESSENGER.\nThe very flower and crown of Persia’s race,\nGallant of soul and glorious in descent,\nAnd highest held in trust before the king,\nLies shamefully and miserably slain.\nATOSSA.\nAlas for me and for this ruin, friends!\nDead, sayest thou? by what fate overthrown?\nMESSENGER.\nAn islet is there, fronting Salamis—\nStrait, and with evil anchorage: thereon\nPan treads the measure of the dance he loves\nAlong the sea-beach. Thither the king sent\nHis noblest, that, whene’er the Grecian foe\nShould ’scape, with shattered ships, unto the isle,\nWe might make easy prey of fugitives\nAnd slay them there, and from the washing tides\nRescue our friends. It fell out otherwise\nThan he divined, for when, by aid of Heaven,\nThe Hellenes held the victory on the sea,\nTheir sailors then and there begirt themselves\nWith brazen mail and bounded from their ships,\nAnd then enringed the islet, point by point,\nSo that our Persians in bewilderment\nKnew not which way to turn. On every side,\nBattered with stones, they fell, while arrows flew\nFrom many a string, and smote them to the death.\nThen, at the last, with simultaneous rush\nThe foe came bursting on us, hacked and hewed\nTo fragments all that miserable band,\nTill not a soul of them was left alive.\nThen Xerxes saw disaster’s depth, and shrieked,\nFrom where he sat on high, surveying all—\nA lofty eminence, beside the brine,\nWhence all his armament lay clear in view.\nHis robe he rent, with loud and bitter wail,\nAnd to his land-force swiftly gave command\nAnd fled, with shame beside him! Now, lament\nThat second woe, upon the first imposed!\nATOSSA.\nOut on thee, Fortune! thou hast foiled the hope\nAnd power of Persia: to this bitter end\nMy son went forth to wreak his great revenge\nOn famous Athens! all too few they seemed,\nOur men who died upon the Fennel-field!\nVengeance for them my son had mind to take,\nAnd drew on his own head these whelming woes.\nBut thou, say on! the ships that ’scaped from wreck—\nWhere didst thou leave them? make thy story clear.\nMESSENGER.\nThe captains of the ships that still survived\nFled in disorder, scudding down the wind,\nThe while our land-force on Boeotian soil\nFell into ruin, some beside the springs\nDropping before they drank, and some outworn,\nPursued, and panting all their life away.\nThe rest of us our way to Phocis won,\nAnd thence to Doris and the Melian gulf,\nWhere with soft stream Spercheus laves the soil.\nThence to the northward did Phthiotis’ plain,\nAnd some Thessalian fortress, lend us aid,\nFor famine-pinched we were, and many died\nOf drought and hunger’s twofold present scourge.\nThence to Magnesia came we, and the land\nWhere Macedonians dwell, and crossed the ford\nOf Axius, and Bolbe’s reedy fen,\nAnd mount Pangaeus, in Edonian land.\nThere, in the very night we came, the god\nBrought winter ere its time, from bank to bank\nFreezing the holy Strymon’s tide. Each man\nWho heretofore held lightly of the gods,\nNow crouched and proffered prayer to Earth and Heaven!\nThen, after many orisons performed,\nThe army ventured on the frozen ford:\nYet only those who crossed before the sun\nShed its warm rays, won to the farther side.\nFor soon the fervour of the glowing orb\nDid with its keen rays pierce the ice-bound stream,\nAnd men sank through and thrust each other down—\nBest was his lot whose breath was stifled first!\nBut all who struggled through and gained the bank,\nToilfully wending through the land of Thrace\nHave made their way, a sorry, scanted few,\nUnto this homeland. Let the city now\nLament and yearn for all the loved and lost.\nMy tale is truth, yet much untold remains\nOf ills that Heaven hath hurled upon our land.\nCHORUS.\nSpirit of Fate, too heavy were thy feet,\nThose ill to match! that sprang on Persia’s realm.\nATOSSA.\nWoe for the host, to wrack and ruin hurled!\nO warning of the night, prophetic dream!\nThou didst foreshadow clearly all the doom,\nWhile ye, old men, made light of woman’s fears!\nAh well—yet, as your divination ruled\nThe meaning of the sign, I hold it good,\nFirst, that I put up prayer unto the gods,\nAnd, after that, forth from my palace bring\nThe sacrificial cake, the offering due\nTo Earth and to the spirits of the dead.\nToo well I know it is a timeless rite\nOver a finished thing that cannot change!\nBut yet—I know not—there may come of it\nAlleviation for the after time.\nYou it beseems, in view of what hath happed,\nT’ advise with loyal hearts our loyal guards:\nAnd to my son—if, ere my coming forth,\nHe should draw hitherward—give comfort meet,\nEscort him to the palace in all state,\nLest to these woes he add another woe!\n[Exit ATOSSA.]\nCHORUS.\nZeus, lord and king! to death and nought\nOur countless host by thee is brought.\nDeep in the gloom of death, to-day,\nLie Susa and Ecbatana:\nHow many a maid in sorrow stands\nAnd rends her tire with tender hands!\nHow tears run down, in common pain\nAnd woeful mourning for the slain!\nO delicate in dole and grief,\nYe Persian women! past relief\nIs now your sorrow! to the war\nYour loved ones went and come no more!\nGone from you is your joy and pride—\nSevered the bridegroom from the bride—\nThe wedded couch luxurious\nIs widowed now, and all the house\nPines ever with insatiate sighs,\nAnd we stand here and bid arise,\nFor those who forth in ardour went\nAnd come not back, the loud lament!\nLand of the East, thou mournest for the host,\nBereft of all thy sons, alas the day!\nFor them whom Xerxes led hath Xerxes lost—\nXerxes who wrecked the fleet, and flung our hopes away!\nHow came it that Darius once controlled,\nAnd without scathe, the army of the bow,\nLoved by the folk of Susa, wise and bold?\nNow is the land-force lost, the shipmen sunk below!\nAh for the ships that bore them, woe is me!\nBore them to death and doom! the crashing prows\nOf fierce Ionian oarsmen swept the sea,\nAnd death was in their wake, and shipwreck murderous!\nLate, late and hardly—if true tales they tell—\nDid Xerxes flee along the wintry way\nAnd snows of Thrace—but ah, the first who fell\nLie by the rocks or float upon Cychrea’s bay!\nMourn, each and all! waft heavenward your cry,\nStung to the soul, bereaved, disconsolate!\nWail out your anguish, till it pierce the sky,\nIn shrieks of deep despair, ill-omened, desperate!\nThe dead are drifting, yea, are gnawed upon\nBy voiceless children of the stainless sea,\nOr battered by the surge! we mourn and groan\nFor husbands gone to death, for childless agony!\nAlas the aged men, who mourn to-day\nThe ruinous sorrows that the gods ordain!\nO’er the wide Asian land, the Persian sway\nCan force no tribute now, and can no rule sustain.\nYea, men will crouch no more to fallen power\nAnd kingship overthrown! the whole land o’er,\nMen speak the thing they will, and from this hour\nThe folk whom Xerxes ruled obey his word no more.\nThe yoke of force is broken from the neck—\nThe isle of Ajax and th’ encircling wave\nReek with a bloody crop of death and wreck\nOf Persia’s fallen power, that none can lift nor save!\nRe-enter ATOSSA, in mourning robes.\nATOSSA.\nFriends, whosoe’er is versed in human ills,\nKnoweth right well that when a wave of woe\nComes on a man, he sees in all things fear;\nWhile, in flood-tide of fortune, ’tis his mood\nTo take that fortune as unchangeable,\nWafting him ever forward. Mark me now—\nThe gods’ thwart purpose doth confront mine eyes,\nAnd all is terror to me; in mine ears\nThere sounds a cry, but not of triumph now—\nSo am I scared at heart by woe so great.\nTherefore I wend forth from the house anew,\nBorne in no car of state, nor robed in pride\nAs heretofore, but bringing, for the sire\nWho did beget my son, libations meet\nFor holy rites that shall appease the dead—\nThe sweet white milk, drawn from a spotless cow,\nThe oozing drop of golden honey, culled\nBy the flower-haunting bee, and therewithal\nPure draughts of water from a virgin spring;\nAnd lo! besides, the stainless effluence,\nBorn of the wild vine’s bosom, shining store\nTreasured to age, this bright and luscious wine.\nAnd eke the fragrant fruit upon the bough\nOf the grey olive-tree, which lives its life\nIn sprouting leafage, and the twining flowers,\nBright children of the earth’s fertility.\nBut you, O friends! above these offerings poured\nTo reconcile the dead, ring out your dirge\nTo summon up Darius from the shades,\nHimself a shade; and I will pour these draughts,\nWhich earth shall drink, unto the gods of hell.\nCHORUS.\nQueen, by the Persian land adored,\nBy thee be this libation poured,\nPassing to those who hold command\nOf dead men in the spirit-land!\nAnd we will sue, in solemn chant,\nThat gods who do escort the dead\nIn nether realms, our prayer may grant—\nBack to us be Darius led!\nO Earth, and Hermes, and the king\nOf Hades, our Darius bring!\nFor if, beyond the prayers we prayed,\nHe knoweth aught of help or aid,\nHe, he alone, in realms below,\nCan speak the limit of our woe!\nDoth he hear me, the king we adored, who is god among gods of the dead?\nDoth he hear me send out in my sorrow the pitiful, manifold cry,\nThe sobbing lament and appeal? is the voice of my suffering sped\nTo the realm of the shades? doth he hear me and pity my sorrowful sigh?\nO Earth, and ye Lords of the dead! release ye that spirit of might,\nWho in Susa the palace was born! let him rise up once more to the light!\nThere is none like him, none of all\nThat e’er were laid in Persian sepulchres!\nBorne forth he was to honoured burial,\nA royal heart! and followed by our tears.\nGod of the dead, O give him back to us,\nDarius, ruler glorious!\nHe never wasted us with reckless war—\nGod, counsellor, and king, beneath a happy star!\nAncient of days and king, awake and come—\nRise o’er the mounded tomb!\nRise, plant thy foot, with saffron sandal shod\nFather to us, and god!\nRise with thy diadem, O sire benign,\nUpon thy brow!\nList to the strange new sorrows of thy line,\nSire of a woeful son!\nA mist of fate and hell is round us now,\nAnd all the city’s flower to death is done!\nAlas, we wept thee once, and weep again!\nO Lord of lords, by recklessness twofold\nThe land is wasted of its men,\nAnd down to death are rolled\nWreckage of sail and oar,\nShips that are ships no more,\nAnd bodies of the slain!\nThe GHOST OF DARIUS rises.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nYe aged Persians, truest of the true,\nCoevals of the youth that once was mine,\nWhat troubleth now our city? harken, how\nIt moans and beats the breast and rends the plain!\nAnd I, beholding how my consort stood\nBeside my tomb, was moved with awe, and took\nThe gift of her libation graciously.\nBut ye are weeping by my sepulchre,\nAnd, shrilling forth a sad, evoking cry,\nSummon me mournfully, Arise, arise.\nNo light thing is it, to come back from death,\nFor, in good sooth, the gods of nether gloom\nAre quick to seize but late and loth to free!\nYet among them I dwell as one in power—\nAnd lo, I come! now speak, and speed your words,\nLest I be blamed for tarrying overlong!\nWhat new disaster broods o’er Persia’s realm?\nCHORUS.\nWith awe on thee I gaze,\nAnd, standing face to face,\nI tremble as I did in olden days!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay, but as I rose to earth again, obedient to your call,\nPrithee, tarry not in parley! be one word enough for all—\nSpeak and gaze on me unshrinking, neither let my face appal!\nCHORUS.\nI tremble to reveal,\nYet tremble to conceal\nThings hard for friends to feel!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay, but if the old-time terror on your spirit keeps its hold,\nSpeak thou, O royal lady who didst couch with me of old!\nStay thy weeping and lamenting and to me reveal the truth—\nSpeak! for man is born to sorrow; yea, the proverb sayeth sooth!\n’Tis the doom of mortal beings, if they live to see old age,\nTo suffer bale, by land and sea, through war and tempest’s rage.\nATOSSA.\nO thou whose blissful fate on earth all mortal weal excelled—\nWho, while the sunlight touched thine eyes, the lord of all wert held!\nA god to Persian men thou wert, in bliss and pride and fame—\nI hold thee blest too in thy death, or e’er the ruin came!\nAlas, Darius! one brief word must tell thee all the tale—\nThe Persian power is in the dust, gone down in blood and bale!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nSpeak—by what chance? did man rebel, or pestilence descend?\nATOSSA.\nNeither! by Athens’ fatal shores our army met its end.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWhich of my children led our host to Athens? speak and say.\nATOSSA.\nThe froward Xerxes, leaving all our realm to disarray.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWas it with army or with fleet on folly’s quest he went?\nATOSSA.\nWith both alike, a twofold front of double armament.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAnd how then did so large a host on foot pass o’er the sea?\nATOSSA.\nHe bridged the ford of Helle’s strait by artful carpentry.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHow? could his craft avail to span the torrent of that tide?\nATOSSA.\n’Tis sooth I say—some unknown power did fatal help provide!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas, that power in malice came, to his bewilderment!\nATOSSA.\nAlas, we see the end of all, the ruin on us sent.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nSpeak, tell me how they fared therein, that thus ye mourn and weep?\nATOSSA.\nDisaster to the army came, through ruin on the deep!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nIs all undone? hath all the folk gone down before the foe?\nATOSSA.\nYea, hark to Susa’s mourning cry for warriors laid low!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas for all our gallant aids, our Persia’s help and pride!\nATOSSA.\nAy! old with young, the Bactrian force hath perished at our side!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas, my son! what gallant youths hath he sent down to death!\nATOSSA.\nAlone, or with a scanty guard—for so the rumour saith—\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHe came—but how, and to what end? doth aught of hope remain?\nATOSSA.\nWith joy he reached the bridge that spanned the Hellespontine main.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHow? is he safe, in Persian land? speak soothly, yea or nay!\nATOSSA.\nClear and more clear the rumour comes, for no man to gainsay.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWoe for the oracle fulfilled, the presage of the war\nLaunched on my son, by will of Zeus! I deemed our doom afar\nIn lap of time; but, if a king push forward to his fate,\nThe god himself allures to death that man infatuate!\nSo now the very fount of woe streams out on those I loved,\nAnd mine own son, unwisely bold, the truth hereof hath proved!\nHe sought to shackle and control the Hellespontine wave,\nThat rushes from the Bosphorus, with fetters of a slave!—\nTo curb and bridge, with welded links, the streaming water-way,\nAnd guide across the passage broad his manifold array!\nAh, folly void of counsel! he deemed that mortal wight\nCould thwart the will of Heaven itself and curb Poseidon’s might!\nWas it not madness? much I fear lest all my wealth and store\nPass from my treasure-house, to be the snatcher’s prize once more!\nATOSSA.\nSuch is the lesson, ah, too late! to eager Xerxes taught—\nTrusting random counsellors and hare-brained men of nought,\nWho said Darius mighty wealth and fame to us did bring,\nBut thou art nought, a blunted spear, a palace-keeping king!\nUnto those sorry counsellors a ready ear he lent,\nAnd led away to Hellas’ shore his fated armament.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nTherefore through them hath come calamity\nMost huge and past forgetting; nor of old\nDid ever such extermination fall\nUpon the city Susa. Long ago\nZeus in his power this privilege bestowed,\nThat with a guiding sceptre one sole man\nShould rule this Asian land of flock and herd.\nOver the folk a Mede, Astyages,\nDid grasp the power: then Cyaxares ruled\nIn his sire’s place, and held the sway aright,\nSteering his state with watchful wariness.\nThird in succession, Cyrus, blest of Heaven,\nHeld rule and ’stablished peace for all his clan:\nLydian and Phrygian won he to his sway,\nAnd wide Ionia to his yoke constrained,\nFor the god favoured his discretion sage.\nFourth in the dynasty was Cyrus’ son,\nAnd fifth was Mardus, scandal of his land\nAnd ancient lineage. Him Artaphrenes,\nHardy of heart, within his palace slew,\nAided by loyal plotters, set for this.\nAnd I too gained the lot for which I craved,\nAnd oftentimes led out a goodly host,\nYet never brought disaster such as this\nUpon the city. But my son is young\nAnd reckless in his youth, and heedeth not\nThe warnings of my mouth. Mark this, my friends,\nBorn with my birth, coeval with mine age—\nNot all we kings who held successive rule\nHave wrought, combined, such ruin as my son!\nCHORUS.\nHow then, O King Darius? whitherward\nDost thou direct thy warning? from this plight\nHow can we Persians fare towards hope again?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nBy nevermore assailing Grecian lands,\nEven tho’ our Median force be double theirs—\nFor the land’s self protects its denizens.\nCHORUS.\nHow meanest thou? by what defensive power?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nShe wastes by famine a too countless foe.\nCHORUS.\nBut we will bring a host more skilled than huge.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWhy, e’en that army, camped in Hellas still,\nShall never win again to home and weal!\nCHORUS.\nHow say’st thou? will not all the Asian host\nPass back from Europe over Helle’s ford?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay—scarce a tithe of all those myriads,\nIf man may trust the oracles of Heaven\nWhen he beholds the things already wrought,\nNot false with true, but true with no word false\nIf what I trow be truth, my son has left\nA chosen rear-guard of our host, in whom\nHe trusts, now, with a random confidence!\nThey tarry where Asopus laves the ground\nWith rills that softly bless Boeotia’s plain—\nThere is it fated for them to endure\nThe very crown of misery and doom,\nRequital for their god-forgetting pride!\nFor why? they raided Hellas, had the heart\nTo wrong the images of holy gods,\nAnd give the shrines and temples to the flame!\nDefaced and dashed from sight the altars fell,\nAnd each god’s image, from its pedestal\nThrust and flung down, in dim confusion lies!\nTherefore, for outrage vile, a doom as dark\nThey suffer, and yet more shall undergo—\nThey touch no bottom in the swamp of doom,\nBut round them rises, bubbling up, the ooze!\nSo deep shall lie the gory clotted mass\nOf corpses by the Dorian spear transfixed\nUpon Plataea’s field! yea, piles of slain\nTo the third generation shall attest\nBy silent eloquence to those that see—\nLet not a mortal vaunt him overmuch.\nFor pride grows rankly, and to ripeness brings\nThe curse of fate, and reaps, for harvest, tears!\nTherefore when ye behold, for deeds like these,\nSuch stern requital paid, remember then\nAthens and Hellas. Let no mortal wight,\nHolding too lightly of his present weal\nAnd passionate for more, cast down and spill\nThe mighty cup of his prosperity!\nDoubt not that over-proud and haughty souls\nZeus lours in wrath, exacting the account.\nTherefore, with wary warning, school my son,\nThough he be lessoned by the gods already,\nTo curb the vaunting that affronts high Heaven!\nAnd thou, O venerable Mother-queen,\nBeloved of Xerxes, to the palace pass\nAnd take therefrom such raiment as befits\nThy son, and go to meet him: for his garb\nIn this extremity of grief hangs rent\nAround his body, woefully unstitched,\nMere tattered fragments of once royal robes!\nGo thou to him, speak soft and soothing words—\nThee, and none other, will he bear to hear,\nAs well I know. But I must pass away\nFrom earth above, unto the nether gloom;\nTherefore, old men, take my farewell, and clasp,\nEven amid the ruin of this time,\nUnto your souls the pleasure of the day,\nFor dead men have no profit of their gold!\n[The GHOST OF DARIUS sinks.]\nCHORUS.\nAlas, I thrill with pain for Persia’s woes—\nMany fulfilled, and others hard at hand!\nATOSSA.\nO spirit of the race, what sorrows crowd\nUpon me! and this anguish stings me worst,\nThat round my royal son’s dishonoured form\nHang rags and tatters, degradation deep!\nI will away, and, bringing from within\nA seemly royal robe, will straightway strive\nTo meet and greet my son: foul scorn it were\nTo leave our dearest in his hour of shame.\n[Exit ATOSSA.]\nCHORUS.\nAh glorious and goodly they were, the life and the lot that we gained,\nThe cities we held in our hand when the monarch invincible reigned,\nThe king that was good to his realm, sufficing, fulfilled of his sway,\nA lord that was peer of the gods, the pride of the bygone day!\nThen could we show to the skies great hosts and a glorious name,\nAnd laws that were stable in might; as towers they guarded our fame!\nThere without woe or disaster we came from the foe and the fight,\nIn triumph, enriched with the spoil, to the land and the city’s delight.\nWhat towns ere the Halys he passed! what towns ere he came to the West,\nTo the main and the isles of the Strymon, and the Thracian region possess’d!\nAnd those that stand back from the main, enringed by their fortified wall,\nGave o’er to Darius, the king, the sceptre and sway over all!\nThose too by the channel of Helle, where southward it broadens and glides,\nBy the inlets, Propontis! of thee, and the strait of the Pontic tides,\nAnd the isles that lie fronting our sea-board, and the Eastland looks on each one,\nLesbo and Chios and Paros, and Samos with olive-trees grown,\nAnd Naxos, and Myconos’ rock, and Tenos with Andros hard by,\nAnd isles that in midmost Aegean, aloof from the continent, lie—\nAnd Lemnos and Icaros’ hold—all these to his sceptre were bowed,\nAnd Cnidos and neighbouring Rhodes, and Soli, and Paphos the proud,\nAnd Cyprian Salamis, name-child of her who hath wrought us this wrong!\nYea, and all the Ionian tract, where the Greek-born inhabitants throng,\nAnd the cities are teeming with gold—Darius was lord of them all,\nAnd, great by his wisdom, he ruled, and ever there came to his call,\nIn stalwart array and unfailing, the warrior chiefs of our land,\nAnd mingled allies from the tribes who bowed to his conquering hand!\nBut now there are none to gainsay that the gods are against us; we lie\nSubdued in the havoc of wreck, and whelmed by the wrath of the sky!\nEnter XERXES in disarray.\nXERXES.\nAlas the day, that I should fall\nInto this grimmest fate of all,\nThis ruin doubly unforeseen!\nOn Persia’s land what power of Fate\nDescends, what louring gloom of hate?\nHow shall I bear my teen?\nMy limbs are loosened where they stand,\nWhen I behold this aged band—\nOh God! I would that I too, I,\nAmong the men who went to die,\nWere whelmed in earth by Fate’s command!\nCHORUS.\nAh welladay, my King! ah woe\nFor all our heroes’ overthrow—\nFor all the gallant host’s array,\nFor Persia’s honour, pass’d away,\nFor glory and heroic sway\nMown down by Fortune’s hand to-day!\nHark, how the kingdom makes its moan,\nFor youthful valour lost and gone,\nBy Xerxes shattered and undone!\nHe, he hath crammed the maw of hell\nWith bowmen brave, who nobly fell,\nTheir country’s mighty armament,\nTen thousand heroes deathward sent!\nAlas, for all the valiant band,\nO king and lord! thine Asian land\nDown, down upon its knee is bent!\nXERXES.\nAlas, a lamentable sound,\nA cry of ruth! for I am found\nA curse to land and lineage,\nWith none my sorrow to assuage!\nCHORUS.\nAlas, a death-song desolate\nI send forth, for thy home-coming!\nA scream, a dirge for woe and fate,\nSuch as the Asian mourners sing,\nA sorry and ill-omened tale\nOf tears and shrieks and Eastern wail!\nXERXES.\nAy, launch the woeful sorrow’s cry,\nThe harsh, discordant melody,\nFor lo, the power, we held for sure,\nHath turned to my discomfiture!\nCHORUS.\nYea, dirges, dirges manifold\nWill I send forth, for warriors bold,\nFor the sea-sorrow of our host!\nThe city mourns, and I must wail\nWith plashing tears our sorrow’s tale,\nLamenting for the loved and lost!\nXERXES.\nAlas, the god of war, who sways\nThe scales of fight in diverse ways,\nGives glory to Ionia!\nIonian ships, in fenced array,\nHave reaped their harvest in the bay,\nA darkling harvest-field of Fate,\nA sea, a shore, of doom and hate!\nCHORUS.\nCry out, and learn the tale of woe!\nWhere are thy comrades? where the band\nWho stood beside thee, hand in hand,\nA little while ago?\nWhere now hath Pharandákes gone,\nWhere Psammis, and where Pelagon?\nWhere now is brave Agdabatas,\nAnd Susas too, and Datamas?\nHath Susiscanes past away,\nThe chieftain of Ecbatana?\nXERXES.\nI left them, mangled castaways,\nFlung from their Tyrian deck, and tossed\nOn Salaminian water-ways,\nFrom surging tides to rocky coast!\nCHORUS.\nAlack, and is Pharnuchus slain,\nAnd Ariomardus, brave in vain?\nWhere is Seualces’ heart of fire?\nLilaeus, child of noble sire?\nAre Tharubis and Memphis sped?\nHystaechmas, Artembáres dead?\nAnd where is brave Masistes, where?\nSum up death’s count, that I may hear!\nXERXES.\nAlas, alas, they came, their eyes surveyed\nAncestral Athens on that fatal day.\nThen with a rending struggle were they laid\nUpon the land, and gasped their life away!\nCHORUS.\nAnd Batanochus’ child, Alpistus great,\nSurnamed the Eye of State—\nSaw you and left you him who once of old\nTen thousand thousand fighting-men enrolled?\nHis sire was child of Sesamas, and he\nFrom Megabates sprang. Ah, woe is me,\nThou king of evil fate!\nHast thou lost Parthus, lost Oebares great?\nAlas, the sorrow! blow succeedeth blow\nOn Persia’s pride; thou tellest woe on woe!\nXERXES.\nBitter indeed the pang for comrades slain,\nThe brave and bold! thou strikest to my soul\nPain, pain beyond forgetting, hateful pain.\nMy inner spirit sobs and sighs with dole!\nCHORUS.\nAnother yet we yearn to see,\nAnd see not! ah, thy chivalry,\nXanthis, thou chief of Mardian men\nCountless! and thou, Anchares bright,\nAnd ye, whose cars controlled the fight,\nArsaces and Diaixis wight,\nKegdadatas, Lythimnas dear,\nAnd Tolmus, greedy of the spear!\nI stand bereft! not in thy train\nCome they, as erst! ah, ne’er again\nShall they return unto our eyes,\nCar-borne, ’neath silken canopies!\nXERXES.\nYea, gone are they who mustered once the host!\nCHORUS.\nYea, yea, forgotten, lost!\nXERXES.\nAlas, the woe and cost!\nCHORUS.\nAlas, ye heavenly powers!\nYe wrought a sorrow past belief,\nA woe, of woes the chief!\nWith aspect stern, upon us Ate looms!\nXERXES.\nSmitten are we—time tells no heavier blow!\nCHORUS.\nSmitten! the doom is plain!\nXERXES.\nCurse upon curse and pang on pang we know!\nCHORUS.\nWith the Ionian power\nWe clashed, in evil hour!\nWoe falls on Persia’s race, yea, woe again, again!\nXERXES.\nYea, smitten am I, and my host is all to ruin hurled!\nCHORUS.\nYea verily—in mighty wreck hath sunk the Persian world!\nXERXES.\n(holding up a torn robe and a quiver)\nSee you this tattered rag of pride?\nCHORUS.\nI see it, welladay!\nXERXES.\nSee you this quiver?\nCHORUS.\nSay, hath aught survived and ’scaped the fray?\nXERXES.\nA store for darts it was, erewhile!\nCHORUS.\nRemain but two or three!\nXERXES.\nNo aid is left!\nCHORUS.\nIonian folk such darts, unfearing, see!\nXERXES.\nRight resolute they are!

    "content":"PROMETHEUS BOUND\nARGUMENT\nIn the beginning, Ouranos and Gaia held sway over Heaven and Earth. And manifold children were born unto them, of whom were Cronos, and Okeanos, and the Titans, and the Giants. But Cronos cast down his father Ouranos, and ruled in his stead, until Zeus his son cast him down in his turn, and became King of Gods and men. Then were the Titans divided, for some had good will unto Cronos, and others unto Zeus; until Prometheus, son of the Titan Iapetos, by wise counsel, gave the victory to Zeus. But Zeus held the race of mortal men in scorn, and was fain to destroy them from the face of the earth; yet Prometheus loved them, and gave secretly to them the gift of fire, and arts whereby they could prosper upon the earth. Then was Zeus sorely angered with Prometheus, and bound him upon a mountain, and afterward overwhelmed him in an earthquake, and devised other torments against him for many ages; yet could he not slay Prometheus, for he was a God.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nSTRENGTH AND FORCE.\nHEPHAESTUS.\nPROMETHEUS.\nCHORUS OF SEA-NYMPHS.\nDAUGHTERS OF OCEANUS.\nOCEANUS.\nIO.\nHERMES.\nScene—A rocky ravine in the mountains of Scythia.\nSTRENGTH.\nLo, the earth’s bound and limitary land,\nThe Scythian steppe, the waste untrod of men!\nLook to it now, Hephaestus—thine it is,\nThy Sire obeying, this arch-thief to clench\nAgainst the steep-down precipice of rock,\nWith stubborn links of adamantine chain.\nLook thou: thy flower, the gleaming plastic fire,\nHe stole and lent to mortal man—a sin\nThat gods immortal make him rue to-day,\nLessoned hereby to own th’ omnipotence\nOf Zeus, and to repent his love to man!\nHEPHAESTUS.\nO Strength and Force, for you the best of Zeus\nStands all achieved, and nothing bars your will:\nBut I—I dare not bind to storm-vext cleft\nOne of our race, immortal as are we.\nYet, none the less, necessity constrains,\nFor Zeus, defied, is heavy in revenge!\n(To PROMETHEUS)\nO deep-devising child of Themis sage,\nSmall will have I to do, or thou to bear,\nWhat yet we must. Beyond the haunt of man\nUnto this rock, with fetters grimly forged,\nI must transfix and shackle up thy limbs,\nWhere thou shalt mark no voice nor human form,\nBut, parching in the glow and glare of sun,\nThy body’s flower shall suffer a sky-change;\nAnd gladly wilt thou hail the hour when Night\nShall in her starry robe invest the day,\nOr when the Sun shall melt the morning rime.\nBut, day or night, for ever shall the load\nOf wasting agony, that may not pass,\nWear thee away; for know, the womb of Time\nHath not conceived a power to set thee free.\nSuch meed thou hast, for love toward mankind\nFor thou, a god defying wrath of gods,\nBeyond the ordinance didst champion men,\nAnd for reward shalt keep a sleepless watch,\nStiff-kneed, erect, nailed to this dismal rock,\nWith manifold laments and useless cries\nAgainst the will inexorable of Zeus.\nHard is the heart of fresh-usurpèd power!\nSTRENGTH.\nEnough of useless ruth! why tarriest thou?\nWhy pitiest one whom all gods wholly hate,\nOne who to man gave o’er thy privilege?\nHEPHAESTUS.\nKinship and friendship wring my heart for him.\nSTRENGTH.\nAy—but how disregard our Sire’s command?\nIs not thy pity weaker than thy fear?\nHEPHAESTUS.\nRuthless as ever, brutal to the full!\nSTRENGTH.\nTears can avail him nothing: strive not thou,\nNor waste thine efforts thus unaidingly.\nHEPHAESTUS.\nOut on my cursed mastery of steel!\nSTRENGTH.\nWhy curse it thus?

The destiny ordained\nI must endure to the best, for well I wot\nThat none may challenge with Necessity.\nYet is it past my patience, to reveal,\nOr to conceal, these issues of my doom.\nSince I to mortals brought prerogatives,\nUnto this durance dismal am I bound:\nYea, I am he who in a fennel-stalk,\nBy stealthy sleight, purveyed the fount of fire,\nThe teacher, proven thus, and arch-resource\nOf every art that aideth mortal men.\nSuch was my sin: I earn its recompense,\nRock-riveted, and chained in height and cold.\n[A pause.]\nListen! what breath of sound,\nwhat fragrance soft hath risen\nUpward to me? is it some godlike essence,\nOr being half-divine, or mortal presence?\nWho to the world’s end comes, unto my craggy prison?\nCraves he the sight of pain, or what would he behold?\nGaze on a god in tortures manifold,\nHeinous to Zeus, and scorned by all\nWhose footsteps tread the heavenly hall,\nBecause too deeply, from on high,\nI pitied man’s mortality!\nHark, and again! that fluttering sound\nOf wings that whirr and circle round,\nAnd their light rustle thrills the air—\nHow all things that unseen draw near\nAre to me Fear!\nEnter the CHORUS OF OCEANIDES in winged cars.\nCHORUS.\nAh, fear us not! as friends, with rivalry\nOf swiftly-vying wings, we came together\nUnto this rock and thee!\nWith our sea-sire we pleaded hard, until\nWe won him to our will,\nAnd swift the wafting breezes bore us hither.\nThe heavy hammer’s steely blow\nThrilled to our ocean-cavern from afar,\nBanished soft shyness from our maiden brow,\nAnd with unsandalled feet we come, in winged car!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAh well-a-day! ye come, ye come\nFrom the Sea-Mother’s teeming home—\nChildren of Tethys and the sire\nWho around Earth rolls, gyre on gyre,\nHis sleepless ocean-tide!\nLook on me—shackled with what chain,\nUpon this chasm’s beetling side\nI must my dismal watch sustain!\nCHORUS.\nYea, I behold, Prometheus! and my fears\nDraw swiftly o’er mine eyes a mist fulfilled of tears,\nWhen I behold thy frame\nBound, wasting on the rock, and put to shame\nBy adamantine chains!\nThe rudder and the rule of Heaven\nAre to strange pilots given:\nZeus with new laws and strong caprice holds sway,\nUnkings the ancient Powers, their might constrains,\nAnd thrusts their pride away!\nPROMETHEUS.\nHad he but hurled me, far beneath\nThe vast and ghostly halls of Death,\nDown to the limitless profound\nOf Tartarus, in fetters bound,\nFixed by his unrelenting hand!\nSo had no man, nor God on high,\nExulted o’er mine agony—\nBut now, a sport to wind and sky,\nMocked by my foes, I stand!\nCHORUS.\nWhat God can wear such ruthless heart\nAs to delight in ill?\nWho in thy sorrow bears not part?\nZeus, Zeus alone! for he, with wrathful will,\nClenched and inflexible,\nBears down Heaven’s race—nor end shall be, till hate\nHis soul shall satiate,\nOr till, by some device, some other hand\nShall wrest from him his sternly-clasped command!\nPROMETHEUS.\nYet,—though in shackles close and strong\nI lie in wasting torments long,—\nYet the new tyrant, ’neath whose nod\nCowers down each blest subservient god,\nOne day, far hence, my help shall need,\nThe destined stratagem to read,\nWhereby, in some yet distant day,\nZeus shall be reaved of pride and sway:\nAnd no persuasion’s honied spell\nShall lure me on, the tale to tell;\nAnd no stern threat shall make me cower\nAnd yield the secret to his power,\nUntil his purpose be foregone,\nAnd shackles yield, and he atone\nThe deep despite that he hath done!\nCHORUS.\nO strong in hardihood, thou striv’st amain\nAgainst the stress of pain!\nBut yet too free, too resolute thy tongue\nIn challenging thy wrong!\nAh, shuddering dread doth make my spirit quiver,\nAnd o’er thy fate sits Fear!\nI see not to what shore of safety ever\nThy bark can steer—\nIn depths unreached the will of Zeus doth dwell,\nHidden, implacable!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy, stern is Zeus, and Justice stands,\nWrenched to his purpose, in his hands—\nYet shall he learn, perforce, to know\nA milder mood, when falls the blow—\nHis ruthless wrath he shall lay still,\nAnd he and I with mutual will\nIn concord’s bond shall go.\nCHORUS.\nUnveil, say forth to us the tale entire,\nUnder what imputation Zeus laid hands\nOn thee, to rack thee thus with shameful pangs?\nTell us—unless the telling pain thee—all!\nPROMETHEUS.\nGrievous alike are these things for my tongue,\nGrievous for silence—rueful everyway.\nKnow that, when first the gods began their strife,\nAnd heaven was all astir with mutual feud—\nSome willing to fling Cronos from his throne,\nAnd set, forsooth, their Zeus on high as king,\nAnd other some in contrariety\nStriving to bar him from heaven’s throne for aye—\nThereon I sought to counsel for the best\nThe Titan brood of Ouranos and Earth;\nYet I prevailed not, for they held in scorn\nMy glozing wiles, and, in their hardy pride,\nDeemed that sans effort they could grasp the sway.\nBut, for my sake, my mother Themis oft,\nAnd Earth, one symbol of names manifold,\nHad held me warned, how in futurity\nIt stood ordained that not by force or power,\nBut by some wile, the victors must prevail.\nIn such wise I interpreted; but they\nDeigned not to cast their heed thereon at all.\nThen, of things possible, I deemed it best,\nJoining my mother’s wisdom to mine own,\nTo range myself with Zeus, two wills in one.\nThus, by device of mine, the murky depth\nOf Tartarus enfoldeth Cronos old\nAnd those who strove beside him. Such the aid\nI gave the lord of heaven—my meed for which\nHe paid me thus, a penal recompense!\nFor ’tis the inward vice of tyranny,\nTo deem of friends as being secret foes.\nNow, to your question—hear me clearly show\nOn what imputed fault he tortures me.\nScarce was he seated on his father’s throne,\nWhen he began his doles of privilege\nAmong the lesser gods, allotting power\nIn trim division; while of mortal men\nNothing he recked, nor of their misery\nNay, even willed to blast their race entire\nTo nothingness, and breed another brood;\nAnd none but I was found to cross his will.\nI dared it, I alone; I rescued men\nFrom crushing ruin and th’ abyss of hell—\nTherefore am I constrained in chastisement\nGrievous to bear and piteous to behold,—\nYea, firm to feel compassion for mankind,\nMyself was held unworthy of the same—\nAy, beyond pity am I ranged and ruled\nTo sufferance—a sight that shames his sway!\nCHORUS.\nA heart of steel, a mould of stone were he,\nWho could complacently behold thy pains\nI came not here as craving for this sight,\nAnd, seeing it, I stand heart-wrung with pain.\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea truly, kindly eyes must pity me!\nCHORUS.\nSay, didst thou push transgression further still?\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy, man thro’ me ceased to foreknow his death.\nCHORUS.\nWhat cure couldst thou discover for this curse?\nPROMETHEUS.\nBlind hopes I sent to nestle in man’s heart.\nCHORUS.\nThis was a goodly gift thou gavest them.\nPROMETHEUS.\nYet more I gave them, even the boon of fire.\nCHORUS.\nWhat? radiant fire, to things ephemeral?\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea—many an art too shall they learn thereby!\nCHORUS.\nThen, upon imputation of such guilt,\nDoth Zeus without surcease torment thee thus?\nIs there no limit to thy course of pain?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNone, till his own will shall decree an end.\nCHORUS.\nAnd how shall he decree it? say, what hope?\nSeëst thou not thy sin? yet of that sin\nIt irks me sore to speak, as thee to hear.\nNay, no more words hereof; bethink thee now,\nFrom this ordeal how to find release.\nPROMETHEUS.\nEasy it is, for one whose foot is set\nOutside the slough of pain, to lesson well\nWith admonitions him who lies therein.\nWith perfect knowledge did I all I did,\nI willed to sin, and sinned, I own it all—\nI championed men, unto my proper pain.\nYet scarce I deemed that, in such cruel doom,\nWithering upon this skyey precipice,\nI should inherit lonely mountain crags,\nHere, in a vast tin-neighboured solitude.\nYet list not to lament my present pains,\nBut, stepping from your cars unto the ground,\nListen, the while I tell the future fates\nNow drawing near, until ye know the whole.\nGrant ye, O grant my prayer, be pitiful\nTo one now racked with woe! the doom of pain\nWanders, but settles, soon or late, on all.\nCHORUS.\nTo willing hearts, and schooled to feel,\nPrometheus, came thy tongue’s appeal;\nTherefore we leave, with lightsome tread,\nThe flying cars in which we sped—\nWe leave the stainless virgin air\nWhere winged creatures float and fare,\nAnd by thy side, on rocky land,\nThus gently we alight and stand,\nWilling, from end to end, to know\nThine history of woe.\nThe CHORUS alight from their winged cars.\nEnter OCEANUS mounted on a griffin.\nOCEANUS.\nThus, over leagues and leagues of space\nI come, Prometheus, to thy place—\nBy will alone, not rein, I guide\nThe winged thing on which I ride;\nAnd much, be sure, I mourn thy case—\nKinship is Pity’s bond, I trow;\nAnd, wert thou not akin, I vow\nNone other should have more than thou\nOf my compassion’s grace!\n’Tis said, and shall be proved; no skill\nHave I to gloze and feign goodwill!\nName but some mode of helpfulness,\nAnd thou wilt in a trice confess\nThat I, Oceanus, am best\nOf all thy friends, and trustiest.\nPROMETHEUS.\nHo, what a sight of marvel! what, thou too\nComest to contemplate my pains, and darest—\n(Yet how, I wot not!) leaving far behind\nThe circling tide, thy namefellow, and those\nRock-arched, self-hollowed caverns—thus to come\nUnto this land, whose womb bears iron ore?\nArt come to see my lot, resent with me\nThe ills I bear? Well, gaze thy fill! behold\nMe, friend of Zeus, part-author of his power—\nMark, in what ruthlessness he bows me down!\nOCEANUS.\nYea, I behold, Prometheus! and would warn\nThee, spite of all thy wisdom, for thy weal!\nLearn now thyself to know, and to renew\nA rightful spirit within thee, for, made new\nWith pride of place, sits Zeus among the gods!\nNow, if thou choosest to fling forth on him\nWords rough with anger thus and edged with scorn,\nZeus, though he sit aloof, afar, on high,\nMay hear thine utterance, and make thee deem\nHis present wrath a mere pretence of pain.\nBanish, poor wretch! the passion of thy soul,\nAnd seek, instead, acquittance from thy pangs!\nBelike my words seem ancientry to thee—\nSuch, natheless, O Prometheus, is the meed\nThat doth await the overweening tongue!\nMeek wert thou never, wilt not crouch to pain,\nBut, set amid misfortunes, cravest more!\nNow—if thou let thyself be schooled by me—\nThou must not kick against the goad. Thou knowest,\nA despot rules, harsh, resolute, supreme,\nWhose law is will. Yet shall I go to him,\nWith all endeavour to relieve thy plight—\nSo thou wilt curb the tempest of thy tongue!\nSurely thou knowest, in thy wisdom deep,\nThe saw—Who vaunts amiss, quick pain is his.\nPROMETHEUS.\nO enviable thou, and unaccused—\nThou who wast art and part in all I dared!\nAnd now, let be! make this no care of thine,\nFor Zeus is past persuasion—urge him not!\nLook to thyself, lest thine emprise thou rue.\nOCEANUS.\nThou hast more skill to school thy neighbour’s fault\nThan to amend thine own: ’tis proved and plain,\nBy fact, not hearsay, that I read this well.\nYet am I fixed to go—withhold me not—\nAssured I am, assured, that Zeus will grant\nThe boon I crave, the loosening of thy bonds.\nPROMETHEUS.\nIn part I praise thee, to the end will praise;\nGoodwill thou lackest not, but yet forbear\nThy further trouble! If thy heart be fain,\nBethink thee that thy toil avails me not.\nNay, rest thee well, aloof from danger’s brink!\nI will not ease my woe by base relief\nIn knowing others too involved therein.\nAway the thought! for deeply do I rue\nMy brother Atlas’ doom. Far off he stands\nIn sunset land, and on his shoulder bears\nThe pillar’d mountain-mass whose base is earth,\nWhose top is heaven, and its ponderous load\nToo great for any grasp. With pity too\nI saw Earth’s child, the monstrous thing of war,\nThat in Cilicia’s hollow places dwelt—\nTypho; I saw his hundred-headed form\nCrushed and constrained; yet once his stride was fierce,\nHis jaws gaped horror and their hiss was death,\nAnd all heaven’s host he challenged to the fray,\nWhile, as one vowed to storm the power of Zeus,\nForth from his eyes he shot a demon glare.\nIt skilled not: the unsleeping bolt of Zeus,\nThe downward levin with its rush of flame,\nSmote on him, and made dumb for evermore\nThe clamour of his vaunting: to the heart\nStricken he lay, and all that mould of strength\nSank thunder-shattered to a smouldering ash;\nAnd helpless now and laid in ruin huge\nHe lieth by the narrow strait of sea,\nCrushed at the root of Etna’s mountain-pile.\nHigh on the pinnacles whereof there sits\nHephaestus, sweltering at the forge; and thence\nOn some hereafter day shall burst and stream\nThe lava-floods, that shall with ravening fangs\nGnaw thy smooth lowlands, fertile Sicily!\nSuch ire shall Typho from his living grave\nSend seething up, such jets of fiery surge,\nHot and unslaked, altho’ himself be laid\nIn quaking ashes by Zeus’ thunderbolt.\nBut thou dost know hereof, nor needest me\nTo school thy sense: thou knowest safety’s road—\nWalk then thereon! I to the dregs will drain,\nTill Zeus relent from wrath, my present woe.\nOCEANUS.\nNay, but, Prometheus, know’st thou not the saw—\nWords can appease the angry soul’s disease?\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy—if in season one apply their salve,\nNot scorching wrath’s proud flesh with caustic tongue.\nOCEANUS.\nBut in wise thought and venturous essay\nPerceivest thou a danger? prithee tell!\nPROMETHEUS.\nI see a fool’s good nature, useless toil.\nOCEANUS.\nLet me be sick of that disease; I know,\nLoyalty, masked as folly, wins the way.\nPROMETHEUS.\nBut of thy blunder I shall bear the blame.\nOCEANUS.\nClearly, thy word would send me home again.\nPROMETHEUS.\nLest thy lament for me should bring thee hate.\nOCEANUS.\nHate from the newly-throned Omnipotence?\nPROMETHEUS.\nBe heedful—lest his will be wroth with thee!\nOCEANUS.\nThy doom, Prometheus, cries to me Beware!\nPROMETHEUS.\nMount, make away, discretion at thy side!\nOCEANUS.\nThy word is said to me in act to go:\nFor lo, my hippogriff with waving wings\nFans the smooth course of air, and fain is he\nTo rest his limbs within his ocean stall.\n[Exit OCEANUS.]\nCHORUS.\nFor the woe and the wreck and the doom, Prometheus I utter my sighs;\nO’er my cheek flows the fountain of tears from tender, compassionate eyes.\nFor stern and abhorred is the sway of Zeus on his self-sought throne,\nAnd ruthless the spear of his scorn, to the gods of the days that are done.\nAnd over the limitless earth goes up a disconsolate cry:\nYe were all so fair, and have fallen; so great and your might has gone by!\nSo wails with a mighty lament the voice of the mortals, who dwell\nIn the Eastland, the home of the holy, for thee and the fate that befel;\nAnd they of the Colchian land, the maidens whose arm is for war;\nAnd the Scythian bowmen, who roam by the lake of Maeotis afar;\nAnd the blossom of battling hordes, that flowers upon Caucasus’ height,\nWith clashing of lances that pierce, and with clamour of swords that smite.\nStrange is thy sorrow! one only I know who has suffered thy pain—\nAtlas the Titan, the god, in a ruthless, invincible chain!\nHe beareth for ever and ever the burden and poise of the sky,\nThe vault of the rolling heaven, and earth re-echoes his cry.\nThe depths of the sea are troubled; they mourn from their caverns profound,\nAnd the darkest and innermost hell moans deep with a sorrowful sound;\nAnd the rivers of waters, that flow from the fountains that spring without stain,\nAre as one in the great lamentation, and moan for thy piteous pain.\nPROMETHEUS.\nDeem not that I in pride or wilful scorn\nRestrain my speech; ’tis wistful memory\nThat rends my heart, when I behold myself\nAbased to wretchedness. To these new gods\nI and none other gave their lots of power\nIn full attainment; no more words hereof\nI speak—the tale ye know. But listen now\nUnto the rede of mortals and their woes,\nAnd how their childish and unreasoning state\nWas changed by me to consciousness and thought.\nYet not in blame of mortals will I speak,\nBut as in proof of service wrought to them.\nFor, in the outset, eyes they had and saw not;\nAnd ears they had but heard not; age on age,\nLike unsubstantial shapes in vision seen,\nThey groped at random in the world of sense,\nNor knew to link their building, brick with brick,\nNor how to turn its aspect to the sun,\nNor how to join the beams by carpentry,\nIn hollowed caves they dwelt, as emmets dwell,\nWeak feathers for each blast, in sunless caves.\nNor had they certain forecast of the cold,\nNor of the advent of the flowery spring,\nNor of the fruitful summer. All they wrought,\nUnreasoning they wrought, till I made clear\nThe laws of rising stars, and inference dim,\nMore hard to learn, of what their setting showed.\nI taught to them withal that art of arts,\nThe lore of number, and the written word\nThat giveth sense to sound, the tool wherewith\nThe gift of memory was wrought in all,\nAnd so came art and song. I too was first\nTo harness ’neath the yoke strong animals,\nObedient made to collar and to weight,\nThat they might bear whate’er of heaviest toil\nMortals endured before. For chariots too\nI trained, and docile service of the rein,\nSteeds, the delight of wealth and pomp and pride.\nI too, none other, for seafarers wrought\nTheir ocean-roaming canvas-wingèd cars.\nSuch arts of craft did I, unhappy I,\nContrive for mortals: now, no feint I have\nWhereby I may elude my present woe.\nCHORUS.\nA rueful doom is thine! distraught of soul,\nAnd all astray, and like some sorry leech\nArt thou, repining at thine own disease,\nUnskilled, unknowing of the needful cure.\nPROMETHEUS.\nMore wilt thou wonder when the rest thou hearest—\nWhat arts for them, what methods I devised.\nForemost was this: if any man fell sick,\nNo aiding art he knew, no saving food,\nNo curing oil nor draught, but all in lack\nOf remedies they dwindled, till I taught\nThe medicinal blending of soft drugs,\nWhereby they ward each sickness from their side.\nI ranged for them the methods manifold\nOf the diviner’s art; I first discerned\nWhich of night’s visions hold a truth for day,\nI read for them the lore of mystic sounds,\nInscrutable before; the omens seen\nWhich bless or ban a journey, and the flight\nOf crook-clawed birds, did I make clear to man—\nAnd how they soar upon the right, for weal,\nHow, on the left, for evil; how they dwell,\nEach in its kind, and what their loves and hates,\nAnd which can flock and roost in harmony.\nFrom me, men learned what deep significance\nLay in the smoothness of the entrails set\nFor sacrifice, and which, of various hues,\nShowed them a gift accepted of the gods;\nThey learned what streaked and varied comeliness\nOf gall and liver told; I led them, too,\n(By passing thro’ the flame the thigh-bones, wrapt\nIn rolls of fat, and th’ undivided chine),\nUnto the mystic and perplexing lore\nOf omens; and I cleared unto their eyes\nThe forecasts, dim and indistinct before,\nShown in the flickering aspect of a flame.\nOf these, enough is said. The other boons,\nStored in the womb of earth, in aid of men—\nCopper and iron, silver, gold withal—\nWho dares affirm he found them ere I found?\nNone—well I know—save who would babble lies!\nKnow thou, in compass of a single phrase—\nAll arts, for mortals’ use, Prometheus gave.\nCHORUS.\nNay, aid not mortal men beyond their due,\nHolding too light a reckoning of thyself\nAnd of thine own distress: good hope have I\nTo see thee once again from fetters free\nAnd matched with Zeus in parity of power.\nPROMETHEUS.\nNot yet nor thus hath Fate ordained the end—\nNot until age-long pains and countless woes\nHave bent and bowed me, shall my shackles fall;\nArt strives too feebly against destiny.\nCHORUS.\nBut what hand rules the helm of destiny?\nPROMETHEUS.\nThe triform Fates, and Furies unforgiving.\nCHORUS.\nThen is the power of Zeus more weak than theirs?\nPROMETHEUS.\nHe may not shun the fate ordained for him.\nCHORUS.\nWhat is ordained for him, save endless rule?\nPROMETHEUS.\nSeek not for answer: this thou may’st not learn.\nCHORUS.\nSurely thy silence hides some solemn thing.\nPROMETHEUS.\nThink on some other theme: ’tis not the hour,\nThis secret to unveil; in deepest dark\nBe it concealed: by guarding it shall I\nEscape at last from bonds, and scorn, and pain.\nCHORUS.\nO never may my weak and faint desire\nStrive against God most high—\nNever be slack in service, never tire\nOf sacred loyalty;\nNor fail to wend unto the altar-side,\nWhere with the blood of kine\nSteams up the offering, by the quenchless tide\nOf Ocean, Sire divine!\nBe this within my heart, indelible—\nOffend not with thy tongue!\nSweet, sweet it is, in cheering hopes to dwell,\nImmortal, ever young,\nIn maiden gladness fostering evermore\nA soft content of soul!\nBut ah, I shudder at thine anguish sore—\nThy doom thro’ years that roll!\nThou could’st not cower to Zeus: a love too great\nThou unto man hast given—\nToo high of heart thou wert—ah, thankless fate!\nWhat aid, ’gainst wrath of Heaven,\nCould mortal man afford? in vain thy gift\nTo things so powerless!\nCould’st thou not see? they are as dreams that drift;\nTheir strength is feebleness\nA purblind race, in hopeless fetters bound,\nThey have no craft or skill,\nThat could o’erreach the ordinance profound\nof the eternal will.\nAlas, Prometheus! on thy woe condign\nI looked, and learned this lore;\nAnd a new strain floats to these lips of mine—\nNot the glad song of yore,\nWhen by the lustral wave I sang to see\nMy sister made thy bride,\nDecked with thy gifts, thy loved Hesione,\nAnd clasped unto thy side.\nEnter IO, horned like a cow.\nIO.\nAlack! what land, what folk are here?\nWhom see I clenched in rocky fetters drear\nUnto the stormy crag? for what thing done\nDost thou in agony atone?\nAh, tell me whither, well-a-day!\nMy feet have roamed their weary way?\nAh, but it maddens, the sting! it burns in my piteous side!\nAh, but the vision, the spectre, the earth-born, the myriad-eyed!\nAvoid thee! Earth, hide him, thine offspring! he cometh—O aspect of ill!\nGhostly, and crafty of face, and dead, but pursuing me still!\nAh, woe upon me, woe ineffable!\nHe steals upon my track, a hound of hell—\nWhere’er I stray, along the sands and brine,\nWeary and foodless, come his creeping eyne!\nAnd ah, the ghostly sound—\nThe wax-stopped reed-flute’s weird and drowsy drone!\nAlack my wandering woes, that round and round\nLead me in many mazes, lost, foredone!\nO child of Cronos! for what deed of wrong\nAm I enthralled by thee in penance long?\nWhy by the stinging bruise, the thing of fear,\nDost thou torment me, heart and brain?\nNay, give me rather to the flames that sear,\nOr to some hidden grave,\nOr to the rending jaws, the monsters of the main!\nNor grudge the boon for which I crave, O king!\nEnough, enough of weary wandering,\nPangs from which none can save!\nHearken! in pity hold\nIo, the ox-horned maid, thy love of old!\nPROMETHEUS.\nHear Zeus or not, I hear and know thee well,\nDaughter of Inachus; I know thee driven,\nStung by the gadfly, mazed with agony.\nAy, thou art she whose beauty fired the breast\nOf Zeus with passion; she whom Hera’s hate\nNow harasses o’er leagues and leagues of land.\nIO.\nAlack, thou namest Inachus my sire!\nWottest thou of him? how, from lips of pain,\nComes to my woeful ears truth’s very strain?\nHow knowest thou the curse, the burning fire\nThe god-sent, piercing pest that stings and clings?\nAh me! in frenzied, foodless wanderings\nHither I come, and on me from on high\nLies Hera’s angry craft! Ah, men unblest!\nNot one there is, not one, that is unblest as I.\nBut thou—tell me the rest!\nUtter the rede of woes to come for me;\nUtter the aid, the cure, if aid or cure there be!\nPROMETHEUS.\nLo, clearly will I show forth all thy quest—\nNot in dark speech, but with such simple phrase\nAs doth befit the utterance of a friend.\nI am Prometheus, who gave fire to men.\nIO.\nO daring, proven champion of man’s race,\nWhat sin, Prometheus, dost thou thus atone?\nPROMETHEUS.\nOne moment since, I told my woes and ceased.\nIO.\nThen should I plead my suit to thee in vain?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNay, speak thy need; nought would I hide from thee.\nIO.\nPronounce who nailed thee to the rocky cleft.\nPROMETHEUS.\nZeus, by intent; Hephaestus, by his hand.\nIO.\nFor what wrongdoing do these pains atone?\nPROMETHEUS.\nWhat I have said, is said; suffice it thee!\nIO.\nYet somewhat add; forewarn me in my woe\nWhat time shall bring my wandering to its goal?\nPROMETHEUS.\nFore-knowledge is fore-sorrow; ask it not.\nIO.\nNay, hide not from me destiny’s decree.\nPROMETHEUS.\nI grudge thee not the gift which I withhold.\nIO.\nThen wherefore tarry ere thou tell me all?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNothing I grudge, but would not rack thy soul.\nIO.\nBe not compassionate beyond my wish.\nPROMETHEUS.\nWell, thou art fain, and I will speak. Attend!\nCHORUS.\nNay—ere thou speak, hear me, bestow on me\nA portion of the grace of granted prayers.\nFirst let us learn how Io’s frenzy came—\n(She telling her disasters manifold)\nThen of their sequel let her know from thee.\nPROMETHEUS.\nWell were it, Io, thus to do their will—\nRight well! they are the sisters of thy sire.\n’Tis worth the waste and effluence of time,\nTo tell, with tears of perfect moan, the doom\nOf sorrows that have fallen, when ’tis sure\nThe listeners will greet the tale with tears.\nIO.\nI know not how I should mistrust your prayer;\nTherefore the whole that ye desire of me\nYe now shall learn in one straightforward tale.\nYet, as it leaves my lips, I blush with shame\nTo tell that tempest of the spite of Heaven,\nAnd all the wreck and ruin of my form,\nAnd whence they swooped upon me, woe is me!\nLong, long in visions of the night there came\nVoices and forms into my maiden bower,\nAlluring me with smoothly glozing words—\nO maiden highly favoured of high Heaven,\nWhy cherish thy virginity so long?\nThine is it to win wedlock’s noblest crown!\nKnow that Zeus’ heart thro’ thee is all aflame,\nPierced with desire as with a dart, and longs\nTo join in utmost rite of love with thee.\nTherefore, O maiden, shun not with disdain\nTh’ embrace of Zeus, but hie thee forth straightway\nTo the lush growth of Lerna’s meadow-land,\nWhere are the flocks and steadings of thy home,\nAnd let Zeus’ eye be eased of its desire.\nNight after night, haunted by dreams like these,\nHeartsick, I ventured at the last to tell\nUnto my sire these visions of the dark.\nThen sent he many a wight, on sacred quest,\nTo Delphi and to far Dodona’s shrine,\nBeing fall fain to learn what deed or word\nWould win him favour from the powers of heaven.\nBut they came back repeating oracles\nMystic, ambiguous, inscrutable,\nTill, at the last, an utterance direct,\nObscure no more, was brought to Inachus—\nA peremptory charge to fling me forth\nBeyond my home and fatherland, a thing\nSent loose in banishment o’er all the world;\nAnd—should he falter—Zeus should launch on him\nA fire-eyed bolt, to shatter and consume\nHimself and all his race to nothingness.\nBowing before such utterance from the shrine\nOf Loxias, he drave me from our halls,\nBarring the gates against me: loth he was\nTo do, as I to suffer, this despite:\nBut the strong curb of Zeus had overborne\nHis will to me-ward. As I parted thence,\nIn form and mind I grew dishumanized,\nAnd horned as now ye see me, poison-stung\nBy the envenomed bitings of the brize,\nI leapt and flung in frenzy, rushed away\nTo the bright waters of Cerchneia’s stream\nAnd Lerna’s beach: but ever at my side,\nA herdsman by his heifer, Argus moved,\nEarth-born, malevolent of mood, and peered,\nWith myriad eyes, where’er my feet would roam.\nBut on him in a moment, unforeseen,\nCame Fate, and sundered him from life; but I,\nStill maddened by the gadfly’s sting, the scourge\nOf God’s infliction, roam the weary world.\nHow I have fared, thou hearest: be there aught\nOf what remains to bear, that thou canst tell,\nSpeak on! but let not thy compassion warm\nThy words to cheering falsehood. Worst of woes\nAre words that break their promise to our hope!\nCHORUS.\nWoe! woe! avaunt—thou and thy tale of bane!\nO never, never dared I dream\nSuch horror of strange sounds should pierce mine ear;\nSuch loathly sights, such tortures hard to bear,\nOutrage, pollution, agony supreme,\nWasting my heart with double edge of pain!\nAh Fate, ah Fate! I gaze on Io’s dole,\nAnd shudder to my soul!\nPROMETHEUS.\nThou wailest all too soon, fulfilled of fear—\nTarry awhile, till thou have learned the whole.\nCHORUS.\nSay on, reveal it! suffering souls are fain\nTo know aright what yet remains to bear.\nPROMETHEUS.\nLightly, with help of mine, did ye achieve\nThat which ye first desired: from Io’s mouth\ncraved to hear, recounted by herself,\nThe story of her strivings. Listen now\nTo what shall follow, to what woefulness\nThe wrath of Hera must compel this maid.\n(To Io)\nAnd thou, O child of Inachus, within\nThine inmost heart store up these words of mine,\nThat thou may’st learn thy wanderings and their goal.\nFirst from this spot toward the sunrise turn,\nAnd cross the steppe that knoweth not the plough:\nThus to the nomad Scythians shalt thou come,\nWho dwell in wattled homes, not built on earth\nBut borne along on wains of sturdy wheel—\nEquipped, themselves, with bows of mighty reach.\nPass them avoidingly, and leave their land,\nAnd skirt the beaches where the tides make moan,\nTill lo! upon the left hand thou shalt find\nThe Chalybes, stout craftsmen of the steel—\nBeware of them! no gentleness is theirs,\nNo kindly welcome to a stranger’s foot!\nThence to the Stream of Violence shalt thou come—\nLike name, like nature; see thou cross it not,\n(’Tis fatal to the forder!) till thou come\nRight to the very Caucasus, the peak\nThat overtops the world, and from its brows\nThe river pants in spray its wrathful stream.\nThence, o’er the pinnacles that court the stars,\nOnward and southward thou must take thy way,\nAnd reach the warlike horde of Amazons,\nMaidens through hate of man; and gladly they\nWill guide thy maiden feet. That host, in days\nThat are not yet, shall fix their home and dwell\nAt Themiscyra, on Thermodon’s bank,\nNigh whereunto the grim projecting fang\nOf Salmydessus’ cape affronts the main,\nThe seaman’s curse, to ships a stepmother!\nThen at the jutting land, Cimmerian styled,\nThat screens the narrowing portal of the mere,\nThou shalt arrive; pass o’er it, brave at heart,\nAnd ferry thee across Macotis’ ford.\nSo shall there be great rumour evermore,\nIn ears of mortals, of thy passage strange;\nAnd Bosporos shall be that channel’s name,\nBecause the ox-horned thing did pass thereby.\nSo, from the wilds of Europe wander’d o’er,\nTo Asia’s continent thou com’st at last.\n(To the CHORUS)\nAnd ye, what think ye? Seems he not, that lord\nAnd tyrant of the gods, as tyrannous\nUnto all other lives? A high god’s lust\nConstrained this mortal maid to roam the world!\n(To Io)\nPoor maid! a brutal wooer sure was thine!\nFor know that all which I have told thee now\nIs scarce the prelude of thy woes to come.\nIO.\nAlas for me, alas!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAgain thou criest, with a heifer’s low.\nWhat wilt thou do, learning thy future woes?\nCHORUS.\nWhat, hast thou further sorrows for her ear?\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea, a vext ocean of predestined pain.\nIO.\nWhat profit then is life to me? Ah, why\nDid I not cast me from this stubborn crag?\nSo with one spring, one crash upon the ground,\nI had attained surcease from all my woes.\nBetter it is to die one death outright\nThan linger out long life in misery.\nPROMETHEUS.\nIll would’st thou bear these agonies of mine—\nMine, with whose fate it standeth not to win\nThe goal of death, which were release from pain!\nNow, there is set no limit to my woe\nTill Zeus be hurled from his omnipotence.\nIO.\nZeus hurled from pride of place! Can such things be?\nPROMETHEUS.\nThou wert full fain, methinks, to see that sight!\nIO.\nEven so—his overthrow who wrought my pain.\nPROMETHEUS.\nThen may’st thou know thereof; such fall shall be.\nIO.\nAnd who shall wrench the sceptre from his hand?\nPROMETHEUS.\nBy his own mindless counsels shall he fall.\nIO.\nAnd how? unless the telling harm, say on!\nPROMETHEUS.\nWooing a bride, his ruin he shall win.\nIO.\nGoddess, or mortal? tell me, if thou may’st.\nPROMETHEUS.\nNo matter which—more must not be revealed.\nIO.\nDoth then a consort thrust him from his throne?\nPROMETHEUS.\nThe child she bears him shall o’ercome his sire.\nIO.\nAnd hath he no avoidance of this doom?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNone, surely—till that I, released from bonds—\nIO.\nWho can release thee, but by will of Zeus?\nPROMETHEUS.\nFate gives this duty to a child of thine!\nIO.\nHow? Shall a child of mine undo thy woes?\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea, of thy lineage, thirteen times removed.\nIO.\nDark beyond guessing grows thine oracle.\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea—seek not therefore to foreknow thy woes.\nIO.\nAs thou didst proffer hope, withdraw it not.\nPROMETHEUS.\nTwo tales I have—choose! for I grant thee one.\nIO.\nAnd which be they? reveal, and leave me choice.\nPROMETHEUS.\nI grant it: shall I in all clearness show\nThy future woes, or my deliverance?\nCHORUS.\nNay! of the two, vouchsafe her wish to her\nAnd mine to me, deigning a truth to each—\nTo her, reveal her future wanderings—\nTo me, thy future saviour, as I crave!\nPROMETHEUS.\nI will not set myself to thwart your will\nWithholding aught of what ye crave to know.\nFirst to thee, Io, will I tell and trace\nThy scared circuitous wandering mark it well,\nDeep in retentive tablets of the soul.\nWhen thou hast overpast the ferry’s flow\nThat sunders continent from continent,\nStraight to the eastward and the flaming face\nOf dawn, and highways trodden by the sun,\nPass, till thou come unto the windy land\nOf daughters born to Boreas: beware\nLest the strong spirit of the stormy blast\nSnatch thee aloft, and sweep thee to the void,\nOn wings of raving wintry hurricane!\nWend by the noisy tumult of the wave,\nUntil thou reach the Gorgon-haunted plains\nBeside Cisthene. In that solitude\nDwell Phorcys’ daughters, beldames worn with time,\nThree, each swan-shapen, single-toothed, and all\nPeering thro’ shared endowment of one eye;\nNever on them doth the sun shed his rays,\nNever falls radiance of the midnight moon.\nBut, hard by these, their sisters, clad with wings,\nSerpentine-curled, dwell, loathed of mortal men,—\nThe Gorgons!—he of men who looks on them\nShall gasp away his life. Of such fell guard\nI bid thee to beware. Now, mark my words\nWhen I another sight of terror tell—\nBeware the Gryphon pack, the hounds of Zeus,\nAs keen of fang as silent of their tongues!\nBeware the one-eyed Arimaspian band\nThat tramp on horse-hoofs, dwelling by the ford\nOf Pluto and the stream that flows with gold:\nKeep thou aloof from these. To the world’s end\nThou comest at the last, the dark-faced tribe\nThat dwell beside the sources of the sun,\nWhere springs the river, Aethiopian named.\nMake thou thy way along his bank, until\nThou come unto the mighty downward slope\nWhere from the overland of Bybline hills\nNile pours his hallowed earth-refreshing wave.\nHe by his course shall guide thee to the realm\nNamed from himself, three-angled, water-girt;\nThere, Io, at the last, hath Fate ordained,\nFor thee and for thy race, the charge to found,\nFar from thy native shore, a new abode.\nLo, I have said: if aught hereof appear\nHard to thy sense and inarticulate,\nQuestion me o’er again, and soothly learn—\nGod wot, I have too much of leisure here!\nCHORUS.\nIf there be aught beyond, or aught pass’d o’er,\nWhich thou canst utter, of her woe-worn maze,\nSpeak on! if all is said, then grant to us\nThat which we asked, as thou rememberest.\nPROMETHEUS.\nShe now hath learned, unto its utmost end,\nHer pilgrimage; but yet, that she may know\nThat ’tis no futile fable she hath heard,\nI will recount her history of toil\nEre she came hither; let it stand for proof\nOf what I told, my forecast of the end.\nSo, then—to sum in brief the weary tale—\nI turn me to thine earlier exile’s close.\nWhen to Molossia’s lowland thou hadst come,\nNigh to Dodona’s cliff and ridge sublime,\n(Where is the shrine oracular and seat\nOf Zeus, Thesprotian styled, and that strange thing\nAnd marvel past belief, the prophet-oaks\nThat syllable his speech), thou by their tongues,\nWith clear acclaim and unequivocal,\nWert thus saluted—Hail, O bride of Zeus\nThat art to be—hast memory thereof?\nThence, stung anew with frenzy, thou didst hie\nAlong the shoreward track, to Rhea’s lap,\nThe mighty main; then, stormily distraught,\nBackward again and eastward. To all time,\nBe well assured, that inlet of the sea\nAll mortal men shall call Ionian,\nIn memory that Io fared thereby.\nTake this for proof and witness that my mind\nHath more in ken than ever sense hath shown.\n(To the CHORUS)\nThat which remains, to you and her alike\nI will relate, and, to my former words\nReverting, add this final prophecy.\n(To Io)\nThere lieth, at the verge of land and sea,\nWhere Nilus issues thro’ the silted sand,\nA town, Canopus called: and there at length\nShall Zeus renew the reason in thy brain\nWith the mere touch and contact of his hand\nFraught now with fear no more: and thou shalt bear\nA child, dark Epaphus—his very name\nMemorial of Zeus’ touch that gave him life.\nAnd his shall be the foison and the fruit\nOf all the land enriched by spreading Nile.\nThence the fifth generation of his seed\nBack unto Argos, yet unwillingly,\nShall flee for refuge—fifty maidens they,\nLoathing a wedlock with their next in blood,\nMore kin than kind, from their sire’s brother sprung.\nAnd on their track, astir with wild desire,\nLike falcons fierce closing on doves that flee,\nShall speed the suitors, craving to achieve\nA prey forbidden, a reluctant bride.\nYet power divine shall foil them, and forbid\nPossession of the maids, whom Argive land\nShall hold protected, when unsleeping hate,\nHorror, and watchful ambush of the night,\nHave laid the suitors dead, by female hands.\nFor every maid shall smite a man to death,\nDyeing a dagger’s edges in his throat—\nSuch bed of love befall mine enemies!\nYet in one bride shall yearning conquer hate,\nBidding her spare the bridegroom at her side,\nBlunting the keen edge of her set resolve.\nThus of two scorns the former shall she choose,\nThe name of coward, not of murderess.\nIn Argos shall she bear, in after time,\nA royal offspring. Long it were to tell\nIn clear succession all that thence shall be.\nTake this for sooth—in lineage from her\nA hero shall arise, an archer great,\nAnd he shall be my saviour from these woes.\nSuch knowledge of the future Themis gave,\nThe ancient Titaness, to me her son.\nBut how, and by what skill, ’twere long to say,\nAnd no whit will the knowledge profit thee.\nIO.\nO woe, O rending and convulsive pain,\nFrenzy and agony, again, again\nSearing my heart and brain!\nO dagger of the sting, unforged with fire\nYet burning, burning ever! O my heart,\nPulsing with horror, beating at my breast!\nO rolling maddened eyes! away, apart,\nRaving with anguish dire,\nI spring, by frenzy-fiends possest.\nO wild and whirling words, that sweep in gloom\nDown to dark waves of doom!\n[Exit IO.]\nCHORUS.\nO well and sagely was it said—\nYea, wise of heart was he who first\nGave forth in speech the thought he nursed—\nIn thine own order see thou wed!\nLet not the humble heart aspire\nTo the gross home of wealth and pride;\nNor be it to a hearth allied\nThat vaunts of many a noble sire.\nO Fates, of awful empery!\nNever may I by Zeus be wooed—\nNever give o’er my maidenhood\nTo any god that dwells on high.\nA shudder to my soul is sent,\nBeholding Io’s doom forlorn—\nBy Hera’s malice put to scorn,\nRoaming in mateless banishment.\nFrom wedlock’s crown of fair desire\nI would not shrink—an idle fear!\nBut may no god to me draw near\nWith shunless might and glance of fire!\nThat were a strife wherein no chance\nOf conquest lies: from Zeus most high\nAnd his resolve, no subtlety\nCould win me my deliverance.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAnd yet shall Zeus, for all his stubborn pride,\nBe brought to low estate! aha, he schemes\nSuch wedlock as shall bring his doom on him,\nFlung from his kingship to oblivion’s lap!\nAy, then the curse his father Cronos spake\nAs he fell helpless from his agelong throne,\nShall be fulfilled unto the utterance!\nNo god but I can manifest to him\nA rescue from such ruin as impends—\nI know it, I, and how it may be foiled.\nGo to, then, let him sit and blindly trust\nHis skyey rumblings, for security,\nAnd wave his levin with its blast of flame!\nAll will avail him not, nor bar his fall\nDown to dishonour vile, intolerable\nSo strong a wrestler is he moulding now\nTo his own proper downfall—yea, a shape\nPortentous and unconquerably huge,\nWho truly shall reveal a flame more strong\nThan is the lightning, and a crash of sound\nMore loud than thunder, and shall dash to nought\nPoseidon’s trident-spear, the ocean-bane\nThat makes the firm earth quiver. Let Zeus strike\nOnce on this rock, he speedily shall learn\nHow far the fall from power to slavery!\nCHORUS.\nBeware! thy wish doth challenge Zeus himself.\nPROMETHEUS.\nI voice my wish and its fulfilment too.\nCHORUS.\nWhat, dare we look for one to conquer Zeus?\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy—Zeus shall wear more painful bonds than mine\nCHORUS.\nDarest thou speak such taunts and tremble not?\nPROMETHEUS.\nWhy should I fear, who am immortal too?\nCHORUS.\nYet he might doom thee to worse agony.\nPROMETHEUS.\nOut on his dooming! I foreknow it all.\nCHORUS.\nYet do the wise revere Necessity.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy, ay—do reverence, cringe and crouch to power\nWhene’er, where’er thou see it! But, for me,\nI reck of Zeus as something less than nought.\nLet him put forth his power, attest his sway,\nHowe’er he will—a momentary show,\nA little brief authority in heaven!\nAha, I see out yonder one who comes,\nA bidden courier, truckling at Zeus’ nod,\nA lacquey in his new lord’s livery,\nSurely on some fantastic errand sped!\nEnter HERMES.\nHERMES.\nThou, double-dyed in gall of bitterness,\nTrickster and sinner against gods, by giving\nThe stolen fire to perishable men!\nAttend—the Sire supreme doth bid thee tell\nWhat is the wedlock which thou vauntest now,\nWhereby he falleth from supremacy?\nSpeak forth the whole, make all thine utterance clear,\nHave done with words inscrutable, nor cause\nTo me, Prometheus! any further toil\nOr twofold journeying. Go to—thou seest\nZeus doth not soften at such words as thine!\nPROMETHEUS.\nPompous, in sooth, thy word, and swoln with pride,\nAs doth befit the lacquey of thy lords!\nO ye young gods! how, in your youthful sway,\nYe deem secure your citadels of sky,\nBeyond the reach of sorrow or of fall!\nHave I not seen two dynasties of gods\nAlready flung therefrom? and soon shall see\nA third, that now in tyranny exults,\nShamed, ruined, in an hour! What sayest thou?\nCrouch I and tremble at these stripling powers?\nSmall homage unto such from me, or none!\nBetake thee hence, sweat back along thy road—\nLook for no answer from me, get thee gone!\nHERMES.\nThink—it was such audacities of will\nThat drove thee erst to anchorage in woe!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy—but mark this: mine heritage of pain\nI would not barter for thy servitude.\nHERMES.\nBetter, forsooth, be bond-slave to a crag,\nThan true-born herald unto Zeus the Sire!\nPROMETHEUS.\nTake thine own coin—taunts for a taunting slave!\nHERMES.\nProud art thou in thy circumstance, methinks!\nPROMETHEUS.\nProud? in such pride then be my foemen set,\nAnd I to see—and of such foes art thou!\nHERMES.\nWhat, blam’st thou me too for thy sufferings?\nPROMETHEUS.\nMark a plain word—I loathe all gods that are,\nWho reaped my kindness and repay with wrong.\nHERMES.\nI hear no little madness in thy words.\nPROMETHEUS.\nMadness be mine, if scorn of foes be mad.\nHERMES.\nPast bearing were thy pride, in happiness.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAh me!\nHERMES.\nZeus knoweth nought of sorrow’s cry!\nPROMETHEUS.\nHe shall!

Bethink thee now—\nIf these my words thou shouldest disregard—\nWhat storm, what might as of a great third wave\nShall dash thy doom upon thee, past escape!\nFirst shall the Sire, with thunder and the flame\nOf lightning, rend the crags of this ravine,\nAnd in the shattered mass o’erwhelm thy form,\nImmured and morticed in a clasping rock.\nThence, after age on age of durance done,\nBack to the daylight shall thou come, and there\nThe eagle-hound of Zeus, red-ravening, fell\nWith greed, shall tatter piecemeal all thy flesh\nTo shreds and ragged vestiges of form—\nYea, an unbidden guest, a day-long bane,\nThat feeds, and feeds—yea, he shall gorge his fill\nOn blackened fragments, from thy vitals gnawed.\nLook for no respite from that agony\nUntil some other deity be found,\nReady to bear for thee the brunt of doom,\nChoosing to pass into the lampless world\nOf Hades and the murky depths of hell.\nHereat, advise thee! ’tis no feigned threat\nWhereof I warn thee, but an o’er-true tale.\nThe lips of Zeus know nought of lying speech,\nBut wreak in action all their words foretell.\nTherefore do thou look warily, and deem\nPrudence a better saviour than self-will.\nCHORUS.\nMeseems that Hermes speaketh not amiss,\nBidding thee leave thy wilfulness and seek\nThe wary walking of a counselled mind.\nGive heed! to err through anger shames the wise.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAll, all I knew, whate’er his tongue\nIn idle arrogance hath flung.\n’Tis the world’s way, the common lot—\nFoe tortures foe and pities not.\nTherefore I challenge him to dash\nHis bolt on me, his zigzag flash\nOf piercing, rending flame!\nNow be the welkin stirred amain\nWith thunder-peal and hurricane,\nAnd let the wild winds now displace\nFrom its firm poise and rooted base\nThe stubborn earthly frame!\nThe raging sea with stormy surge\nRise up and ravin and submerge\nEach high star-trodden way!\nMe let him lift and dash to gloom\nOf nether hell, in whirls of doom!\nYet—do he what extremes he may—\nHe cannot crush my life away!\nHERMES.\nSuch are the counsels, such the strain,\nHeard from wild lips and frenzied brain!\nIn word or thought, how fails his fate\nOf madness wild and desperate?\n(To the CHORUS)\nBut ye, who stand compassionate\nHere at his side, depart in haste!\nLest of his penalty ye taste,\nAnd shattered brain and reason feel\nThe roaring, ruthless thunder-peal!\nCHORUS.\nOut on thee! if thy heart be fain\nI should obey thee, change thy strain!\nVile is thine hinted cowardice,\nAnd loathed of me thy base advice,\nWeakly to shrink from pain!\nNay, at his side, whate’er befall,\nI will abide, endure it all!\nAmong all things abhorr’d, accurst,\nI hold betrayers for the worst!\nHERMES.\nNay, ye are warned! remember well—\nNor cry, when meshed in nets of hell,\nAh cruel fate, ah Zeus unkind—\nThus, by a sentence undivined,\nTo dash us to the realms below!\nIt is no sudden, secret blow—\nNay, ye achieve your proper woe—\nWarn’d and foreknowing shall ye go,\nThrough your own folly trapped and ta’en,\nInto the net the Fates ordain—\nThe vast, illimitable pain!\n[Thunder and lightning.]\nPROMETHEUS.\nHark! for no more in empty word,\nBut in sheer sooth, the world is stirred!\nThe massy earth doth heave and sway,\nAnd thro’ their dark and secret way\nThe cavern’d thunders boom!\nSee, how they gleam athwart the sky,\nThe lightnings, through the gloom!\nAnd whirlwinds roll the dust on high,\nAnd right and left the storm-clouds leap\nTo battle in the skyey deep,\nIn wildest uproar unconfined,\nAn universe of warring wind!\nAnd falling sky and heaving sea\nAre blent in one! on me, on me,\nNearer and ever yet more near,\nFlaunting its pageantry of fear,\nDrives down in might its destined road\nThe tempest of the wrath of God!\nO holy Earth, O mother mine!\nO Sky, that biddest speed along\nThy vault the common Light divine,—\nBe witness of my wrong!\n[The rocks are rent with fire and earthquake, and fall, burying PROMETHEUS in the ruins.]",

    "content":"THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES\nARGUMENT\nLaius, king of the Cadmeans, was warned by the oracle of Delphi that he should not beget a child. But he disobeyed this command, and when a son was born to him, he cast the child away, that he might perish on Cithaeron. But a herdsman found the babe yet alive, and he was nourished in Corinth and grew to manhood, not knowing his true parentage, and was named Oedipus; and he slew, unknowingly, his father, Laius, and afterwards saved the town of the Cadmeans from a devouring monster, and married the widowed queen, Iocaste, and begat sons and daughters. But when he learned what he had wrought unwittingly, he fell into despair, and the queen slew herself. But before Oedipus died, he laid a curse upon his male children, Eteocles and Polynices, that they should make even division of the kingdom by the sword; and it fell out even so, for the two brothers strove together for the inheritance, and Polynices brought an army, from Argos, against Eteocles; and the brothers fought, and fell each by the other’s hand, and the curse was fulfilled.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nETEOCLES.\nA SPY.\nCHORUS OF CADMEAN MAIDENS.\nANTIGONE.\nISMENE.\nA HERALD.\nETEOCLES.\nClansmen of Cadmus, at the signal given\nBy time and season must the ruler speak\nWho sets the course and steers the ship of State\nWith hand upon the tiller, and with eye\nWatchful against the treachery of sleep.\nFor if all go aright, thank Heaven, men say,\nBut if adversely—which may God forefend!—\nOne name on many lips, from street to street,\nWould bear the bruit and rumour of the time,\nDown with Eteocles!—a clamorous curse,\nA dirge of ruin. May averting Zeus\nMake good his title here, in Cadmus’ hold!\nYou it beseems now boys unripened yet\nTo lusty manhood, men gone past the prime\nAnd increase of the full begetting seed,\nAnd those whom youth and manhood well combined\nArray for action—all to rise in aid\nOf city, shrines, and altars of all powers\nWho guard our land; that ne’er, to end of time,\nBe blotted out the sacred service due\nTo our sweet mother-land and to her brood.\nFor she it was who to their guest-right called\nYour waxing youth, was patient of the toil,\nAnd cherished you on the land’s gracious lap,\nAlike to plant the hearth and bear the shield\nIn loyal service, for an hour like this.\nMark now! until to-day, luck rules our scale;\nFor we, though long beleaguered, in the main\nHave with our sallies struck the foemen hard.\nBut now the seer, the feeder of the birds,\n(Whose art unerring and prophetic skill\nOf ear and mind divines their utterance\nWithout the lore of fire interpreted)\nForetelleth, by the mastery of his art,\nThat now an onset of Achaea’s host\nIs by a council of the night designed\nTo fall in double strength upon our walls.\nUp and away, then, to the battlements,\nThe gates, the bulwarks! don your panoplies,\nArray you at the breast-work, take your stand\nOn floorings of the towers, and with good heart\nStand firm for sudden sallies at the gates,\nNor hold too heinous a respect for hordes\nSent on you from afar: some god will guard!\nI too, for shrewd espial of their camp,\nHave sent forth scouts, and confidence is mine\nThey will not fail nor tremble at their task,\nAnd, with their news, I fear no foeman’s guile.\nEnter a SPY.\nTHE SPY.\nEteocles, high king of Cadmus’ folk,\nI stand here with news certified and sure\nFrom Argos’ camp, things by myself descried.\nSeven warriors yonder, doughty chiefs of might,\nInto the crimsoned concave of a shield\nHave shed a bull’s blood, and, with hands immersed\nInto the gore of sacrifice, have sworn\nBy Ares, lord of fight, and by thy name,\nBlood-lapping Terror, Let our oath be heard—\nEither to raze the walls, make void the hold\nOf Cadmus—strive his children as they may—\nOr, dying here, to make the foemen’s land\nWith blood impasted. Then, as memory’s gift\nUnto their parents at the far-off home,\nChaplets they hung upon Adrastus’ car,\nWith eyes tear-dropping, but no word of moan.\nFor their steeled spirit glowed with high resolve,\nAs lions pant, with battle in their eyes.\nFor them, no weak alarm delays the clear\nIssues of death or life! I parted thence\nEven as they cast the lots, how each should lead,\nAgainst which gate, his serried company.\nRank then thy bravest, with what speed thou may’st,\nHard by the gates, to dash on them, for now,\nFull-armed, the onward ranks of Argos come!\nThe dust whirls up, and from their panting steeds\nWhite foamy flakes like snow bedew the plain.\nThou therefore, chieftain! like a steersman skilled,\nEnshield the city’s bulwarks, ere the blast\nOf war comes darting on them! hark, the roar\nOf the great landstorm with its waves of men!\nTake Fortune by the forelock! for the rest,\nBy yonder dawn-light will I scan the field\nClear and aright, and surety of my word\nShall keep thee scatheless of the coming storm.\nETEOCLES.\nO Zeus and Earth and city-guarding gods,\nAnd thou, my father’s Curse, of baneful might,\nSpare ye at least this town, nor root it up,\nBy violence of the foemen, stock and stem!\nFor here, from home and hearth, rings Hellas’ tongue.\nForbid that e’er the yoke of slavery\nShould bow this land of freedom, Cadmus’ hold!\nBe ye her help! your cause I plead with mine—\nA city saved doth honour to her gods!\n[Exit ETEOCLES, etc.]\nEnter the CHORUS OF MAIDENS.\nCHORUS.\nI wail in the stress of my terror, and shrill is my cry of despair.\nThe foemen roll forth from their camp as a billow, and onward they bear!\nTheir horsemen are swift in the forefront, the dust rises up to the sky,\nA signal, though speechless, of doom, a herald more clear than a cry!\nHoof-trampled, the land of my love bears onward the din to mine ears.\nAs a torrent descending a mountain, it thunders and echoes and nears!\nThe doom is unloosened and cometh! O kings and O queens of high Heaven,\nPrevail that it fall not upon us: the sign for their onset is given—\nThey stream to the walls from without, white-shielded and keen for the fray.\nThey storm to the citadel gates— what god or what goddess can stay\nThe rush of their feet? to what shrine shall I bow me in terror and pray?\nO gods high-throned in bliss, we must crouch at the shrines in your home!\nNot here must we tarry and wail: shield clashes on shield as they come—\nAnd now, even now is the hour for the robes and the chaplets of prayer!\nMine eyes feel the flash of the sword, the clang is instinct with the spear!\nIs thy hand set against us, O Ares, in ruin and wrath to o’erwhelm\nThine own immemorial land, O god of the golden helm?\nLook down upon us, we beseech thee, on the land that thou lovest of old,\nAnd ye, O protecting gods, in pity your people behold!\nYea, save us, the maidenly troop, from the doom and despair of the slave,\nFor the crests of the foemen come onward, their rush is the rush of a wave\nRolled on by the war-god’s breath! almighty one, hear us and save\nFrom the grasp of the Argives’ might! to the ramparts of Cadmus they crowd,\nAnd, clenched in the teeth of the steeds, the bits clink horror aloud!\nAnd seven high chieftains of war, with spear and with panoply bold,\nAre set, by the law of the lot, to storm the seven gates of our hold!\nBe near and befriend us, O Pallas, the Zeus-born maiden of might!\nO lord of the steed and the sea, be thy trident uplifted to smite\nIn eager desire of the fray, Poseidon! and Ares come down,\nIn fatherly presence revealed, to rescue Harmonia’s town!\nThine too, Aphrodite, we are! thou art mother and queen of our race,\nTo thee we cry out in our need, from thee let thy children have grace!\nYe too, to scare back the foe, be your cry as a wolf’s howl wild,\nThou, O the wolf-lord, and thou, of she-wolf Leto the child!\nWoe and alack for the sound, for the rattle of cars to the wall,\nAnd the creak of the grinding axles! O Hera, to thee is our call!\nArtemis, maiden beloved! the air is distraught with the spears,\nAnd whither doth destiny drive us, and where is the goal of our fears?\nThe blast of the terrible stones on the ridge of our wall is not stayed,\nAt the gates is the brazen clash of the bucklers—Apollo to aid!\nThou too, O daughter of Zeus, who guidest the wavering fray\nTo the holy decision of fate, Athena! be with us to-day!\nCome down to the sevenfold gates and harry the foemen away!\nO gods and O sisters of gods, our bulwark and guard! we beseech\nThat ye give not our war-worn hold to a rabble of alien speech!\nList to the call of the maidens, the hands held up for the right,\nBe near us, protect us, and show that the city is dear in your sight!\nHave heed for her sacrifice holy, and thought of her offerings take,\nForget not her love and her worship, be near her and smite for her sake!\nRe-enter ETEOCLES.\nETEOCLES\nHark to my question, things detestable!\nIs this aright and for the city’s weal,\nAnd helpful to our army thus beset,\nThat ye before the statues of our gods\nShould fling yourselves, and scream and shriek your fears?\nImmodest, uncontrolled! Be this my lot—\nNever in troublous nor in peaceful days\nTo dwell with aught that wears a female form!\nWhere womankind has power, no man can house,\nWhere womankind feeds panic, ruin rules\nAlike in house and city! Look you now—\nYour flying feet, and rumour of your fears,\nHave spread a soulless panic on our walls,\nAnd they without do go from strength to strength,\nAnd we within make breach upon ourselves!\nSuch fate it brings, to house with womankind.\nTherefore if any shall resist my rule—\nOr man, or woman, or some sexless thing—\nThe vote of sentence shall decide their doom,\nAnd stones of execution, past escape,\nShall finish all. Let not a woman’s voice\nBe loud in council! for the things without,\nA man must care; let women keep within—\nEven then is mischief all too probable!\nHear ye? or speak I to unheeding ears?\nCHORUS.\nAh, but I shudder, child of Oedipus!\nI heard the clash and clang!\nThe axles rolled and rumbled; woe to us\nFire-welded bridles rang!\nETEOCLES.\nSay—when a ship is strained and deep in brine,\nDid e’er a seaman mend his chance, who left\nThe helm, t’invoke the image at the prow?\nCHORUS.\nAh, but I fled to the shrines, I called to our helpers on high,\nWhen the stone-shower roared at the portals!\nI sped to the temples aloft, and loud was my call and my cry,\nLook down and deliver. Immortals!\nETEOCLES.\nAy, pray amain that stone may vanquish steel!\nWere not that grace of gods? ay, ay—methinks,\nWhen cities fall, the gods go forth from them!\nCHORUS.\nAh, let me die, or ever I behold\nThe gods go forth, in conflagration dire!\nThe foemen’s rush and raid, and all our hold\nWrapt in the burning fire!\nETEOCLES.\nCry not: on Heaven, in impotent debate!\nWhat saith the saw?—Good saving Strength, in verity,\nOut of Obedience breeds the babe Prosperity.\nCHORUS.\n’Tis true: yet stronger is the power divine,\nAnd oft, when man’s estate is overbowed\nWith bitter pangs, disperses from his eyne\nThe heavy, hanging cloud!\nETEOCLES.\nLet men with sacrifice and augury\nApproach the gods, when comes the tug of war;\nMaids must be silent and abide within.\nCHORUS.\nBy grace of the gods we hold it, a city untamed of the spear,\nAnd the battlement wards from the wall the foe and his aspect of fear!\nWhat need of displeasure herein?\nETEOCLES.\nAy, pay thy vows to Heaven; I grudge them not,\nBut—so thou strike no fear into our men—\nHave calm at heart, nor be too much afraid.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, it is fresh in mine ears, the clamour and crash of the fray,\nAnd up to our holiest height I sped on my timorous way,\nBewildered, beset by the din!\nETEOCLES.\nNow, if ye hear the bruit of death or wounds,\nGive not yourselves o’ermuch to shriek and scream,\nFor Ares ravens upon human flesh.\nCHORUS.\nAh, but the snorting of the steeds I hear!\nETEOCLES.\nThen, if thou hearest, hear them not too well!\nCHORUS.\nHark, the earth rumbles, as they close us round!\nETEOCLES.\nEnough if I am here, with plans prepared.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, the battering at the gates is loud!\nETEOCLES.\nPeace! stay your tongue, or else the town may hear!\nCHORUS.\nO warders of the walls, betray them not!\nETEOCLES.\nBestrew your cries! in silence face your fate.\nCHORUS.\nGods of our city, see me not enslaved!\nETEOCLES.\nOn me, on all, thy cries bring slavery.\nCHORUS.\nZeus, strong to smite, turn upon foes thy blow!\nETEOCLES.\nZeus, what a curse are women, wrought by thee!\nCHORUS.\nWeak wretches, even as men, when cities fall.\nETEOCLES.\nWhat! clasping gods, yet voicing thy despair?\nCHORUS.\nIn the sick heart, fear machete prey of speech.\nETEOCLES.\nLight is the thing I ask thee—do my will!\nCHORUS.\nAsk swiftly: swiftly shall I know my power.\nETEOCLES.\nSilence, weak wretch! nor put thy friends in fear.\nCHORUS.\nI speak no more: the general fate be mine!\nETEOCLES.\nI take that word as wiser than the rest.\nNay, more: these images possess thy will—\nPray, in their strength, that Heaven be on our side!\nThen hear my prayers withal, and then ring out\nThe female triumph-note, thy privilege—\nYea, utter forth the usage Hellas knows,\nThe cry beside the altars, sounding clear\nEncouragement to friends, alarm to foes.\nBut I unto all gods that guard our walls,\nLords of the plain or warders of the mart\nAnd to Isthmus’ stream and Dirge’s rills,\nI swear, if Fortune smiles and saves our town,\nThat we will make our altars reek with blood\nOf sheep and kine, shed forth unto the gods,\nAnd with victorious tokens front our fannies—\nCorsets and cases that once our foemen wore,\nSpear-shattered now—to deck these holy homes!\nBe such thy vows to Heaven—away with sighs,\nAway with outcry vain and barbarous,\nThat shall avail not, in a general doom!\nBut I will back, and, with six chosen men\nMyself the seventh, to confront the foe\nIn this great aspect of a poisèd war,\nReturn and plant them at the sevenfold gates,\nOr e’er the prompt and clamorous battle-scouts\nHaste to inflame our counsel with the need.\n[Exit ETEOCLES.]\nCHORUS.\nI mark his words, yet, dark and deep,\nMy heart’s alarm forbiddeth sleep!\nClose-clinging cares around my soul\nEnkindle fears beyond control,\nPresageful of what doom may fall\nFrom the great leaguer of the wall!\nSo a poor dove is faint with fear\nFor her weak nestlings, while anew\nGlides on the snaky ravisher!\nIn troop and squadron, hand on hand,\nThey climb and throng, and hemmed we stand,\nWhile on the warders of our town\nThe flinty shower comes hurtling down!\nGods born of Zeus! put forth your might\nFor Cadmus’ city, realm, and right!\nWhat nobler land shall e’er be yours,\nIf once ye give to hostile powers\nThe deep rich soil, and Dirce’s wave,\nThe nursing stream, Poseidon gave\nAnd Tethys’ children? Up and save!\nCast on the ranks that hem us round\nA deadly panic, make them fling\nTheir arms in terror on the ground,\nAnd die in carnage! thence shall spring\nHigh honour for our clan and king!\nCome at our wailing cry, and stand\nAs thronèd sentries of our land!\nFor pity and sorrow it were that this immemorial town\nShould sink to be slave of the spear, to dust and to ashes gone down,\nBy the gods of Achaean worship and arms of Achaean might\nSacked and defiled and dishonoured, its women the prize of the fight—\nThat, haled by the hair as a steed, their mantles dishevelled and torn,\nThe maiden and matron alike should pass to the wedlock of scorn!\nI hear it arise from the city, the manifold wail of despair—\nWoe, woe for the doom that shall be—as in grasp of the foeman they fare!\nFor a woe and a weeping it is, if the maiden inviolate flower\nIs plucked by the foe in his might, not culled in the bridal bower!\nAlas for the hate and the horror—how say it?—less hateful by far\nIs the doom to be slain by the sword, hewn down in the carnage of war!\nFor wide, ah! wide is the woe when the foeman has mounted the wall;\nThere is havoc and terror and flame, and the dark smoke broods over all,\nAnd wild is the war-god’s breath, as in frenzy of conquest he springs,\nAnd pollutes with the blast of his lips the glory of holiest things!\nUp to the citadel rise clash and din,\nThe war-net closes in,\nThe spear is in the heart: with blood imbrued\nYoung mothers wail aloud,\nFor children at their breast who scream and die!\nAnd boys and maidens fly,\nYet scape not the pursuer, in his greed\nTo thrust and grasp and feed!\nRobber with robber joins, each calls his mate\nUnto the feast of hate—\nThe banquet, lo! is spread—\nseize, rend, and tear!\nNo need to choose or share!\nAnd all the wealth of earth to waste is poured—\nA sight by all abhorred!\nThe grieving housewives eye it;\nheaped and blent,\nEarth’s boons are spoiled and spent,\nAnd waste to nothingness; and O alas,\nYoung maids, forlorn ye pass—\nFresh horror at your hearts—beneath the power\nOf those who crop the flower!\nYe own the ruffian ravisher for lord,\nAnd night brings rites abhorred!\nWoe, woe for you! upon your grief and pain\nThere comes a fouler stain.\nEnter on one side THE SPY; on the other ETEOCLES and the SIX CHAMPIONS.\nSEMI-CHORUS.\nLook, friends! methinks the scout, who parted hence\nTo spy upon the foemen, comes with news,\nHis feet as swift as wafting chariot-wheels.\nSEMI-CHORUS.\nAy, and our king, the son of Oedipus,\nComes prompt to time, to learn the spy’s report—\nHis heart is fainter than his foot is fast!\nTHE SPY.\nWell have I scanned the foe, and well can say\nUnto which chief, by lot, each gate is given.\nTydeus already with his onset-cry\nStorms at the gate called Proetides; but him\nThe seer Amphiaraus holds at halt,\nNor wills that he should cross Ismenus’ ford,\nUntil the sacrifices promise fair.\nBut Tydeus, mad with lust of blood and broil,\nLike to a cockatrice at noontide hour,\nHisses out wrath and smites with scourge of tongue\nThe prophet-son of Oecleus—Wise thou art,\nFaint against war, and holding back from death!\nWith such revilings loud upon his lips\nHe waves the triple plumes that o’er his helm\nFloat overshadowing, as a courser’s mane;\nAnd at his shield’s rim, terror in their tone,\nClang and reverberate the brazen bells.\nAnd this proud sign, wrought on his shield, he bears—\nThe vault of heaven, inlaid with blazing stars;\nAnd, for the boss, the bright moon glows at full,\nThe eye of night, the first and lordliest star.\nThus with high-vaunted armour, madly bold,\nHe clamours by the stream-bank, wild for war,\nAs a steed panting grimly on his bit,\nHeld in and chafing for the trumpet’s bray!\nWhom wilt thou set against him? when the gates\nOf Proetus yield, who can his rush repel?\nETEOCLES.\nTo me, no blazon on a foeman’s shield\nShall e’er present a fear! such pointed threats\nAre powerless to wound; his plumes and bells,\nWithout a spear, are snakes without a sting.\nNay, more—that pageant of which thou tellest—\nThe nightly sky displayed, ablaze with stars,\nUpon his shield, palters with double sense—\nOne headstrong fool will find its truth anon!\nFor, if night fall upon his eyes in death,\nYon vaunting blazon will its own truth prove,\nAnd he is prophet of his folly’s fall.\nMine shall it be, to pit against his power\nThe loyal son of Astacus, as guard\nTo hold the gateways—a right valiant soul,\nWho has in heed the throne of Modesty\nAnd loathes the speech of Pride, and evermore\nShrinks from the base, but knows no other fear.\nHe springs by stock from those whom Ares spared,\nThe men called Sown, a right son of the soil,\nAnd Melanippus styled. Now, what his arm\nTo-day shall do, rests with the dice of war,\nAnd Ares shall ordain it; but his cause\nHath the true badge of Right, to urge him on\nTo guard, as son, his motherland from wrong.\nCHORUS.\nThen may the gods give fortune fair\nUnto our chief, sent forth to dare\nWar’s terrible arbitrament!\nBut ah! when champions wend away,\nI shudder, lest, from out the fray,\nOnly their blood-stained wrecks be sent!\nTHE SPY.\nNay, let him pass, and the gods’ help be his!\nNext, Capaneus comes on, by lot to lead\nThe onset at the gates Electran styled:\nA giant he, more huge than Tydeus’ self,\nAnd more than human in his arrogance—\nMay fate forefend his threat against our walls!\nGod willing, or unwilling—such his vaunt—\nI will lay waste this city; Pallas’ self,\nZeus’ warrior maid, although she swoop to earth\nAnd plant her in my path, shall stay me not.\nAnd, for the flashes of the levin-bolt,\nHe holds them harmless as the noontide rays.\nMark, too, the symbol on his shield—a man\nScornfully weaponless but torch in hand,\nAnd the flame glows within his grasp, prepared\nFor ravin: lo, the legend, wrought in words,\nFire for the city bring I, flares in gold!\nAgainst such wight, send forth—yet whom? what man\nWill front that vaunting figure and not fear?\nETEOCLES.\nAha, this profits also, gain on gain!\nIn sooth, for mortals, the tongue’s utterance\nBewrays unerringly a foolish pride!\nHither stalks Capaneus, with vaunt and threat\nDefying god-like powers, equipt to act,\nAnd, mortal though he be, he strains his tongue\nIn folly’s ecstasy, and casts aloft\nHigh swelling words against the ears of Zeus.\nRight well I trust—if justice grants the word—\nThat, by the might of Zeus, a bolt of flame\nIn more than semblance shall descend on him.\nAgainst his vaunts, though reckless, I have set,\nTo make assurance sure, a warrior stern—\nStrong Polyphontes, fervid for the fray;\nA sturdy bulwark, he, by grace of Heaven\nAnd favour of his champion Artemis!\nSay on, who holdeth the next gate in ward?\nCHORUS.\nPerish the wretch whose vaunt affronts our home!\nOn him the red bolt come,\nEre to the maiden bowers his way he cleave,\nTo ravage and bereave!\nTHE SPY.\nI will say on. Eteoclus is third—\nTo him it fell, what time the third lot sprang\nO’er the inverted helmet’s brazen rim,\nTo dash his stormers on Neistae gate.\nHe wheels his mares, who at their frontlets chafe\nAnd yearn to charge upon the gates amain.\nThey snort the breath of pride, and, filled therewith,\nTheir nozzles whistle with barbaric sound.\nHigh too and haughty is his shield’s device—\nAn armèd man who climbs, from rung to rung,\nA scaling ladder, up a hostile wall,\nAfire to sack and slay; and he too cries,\n(By letters, full of sound, upon the shield)\nNot Ares’ self shall cast me from the wall.\nLook to it, send, against this man, a man\nStrong to debar the slave’s yoke from our town.\nETEOCLES (pointing to MEGAREUS)\nSend will I—even this man, with luck to aid—\nBy his worth sent already, not by pride\nAnd vain pretence, is he. ’Tis Megareus,\nThe child of Creon, of the Earth-sprung born!\nHe will not shrink from guarding of the gates,\nNor fear the maddened charger’s frenzied neigh,\nBut, if he dies, will nobly quit the score\nFor nurture to the land that gave him birth,\nOr from the shield-side hew two warriors down\nEteoclus and the figure that he lifts—\nAy, and the city pictured, all in one,\nAnd deck with spoils the temple of his sire!\nAnnounce the next pair, stint not of thy tongue!\nCHORUS.\nO thou, the warder of my home,\nGrant, unto us, Fate’s favouring tide,\nSend on the foemen doom!\nThey fling forth taunts of frenzied pride,\nOn them may Zeus with glare of vengeance come;\nTHE SPY.\nLo, next him stands a fourth and shouts amain,\nBy Pallas Onca’s portal, and displays\nA different challenge; ’tis Hippomedon!\nHuge the device that starts up from his targe\nIn high relief; and, I deny it not,\nI shuddered, seeing how, upon the rim,\nIt made a mighty circle round the shield—\nNo sorry craftsman he, who wrought that work\nAnd clamped it all around the buckler’s edge!\nThe form was Typhon: from his glowing throat\nRolled lurid smoke, spark-litten, kin of fire!\nThe flattened edge-work, circling round the whole,\nMade strong support for coiling snakes that grew\nErect above the concave of the shield:\nLoud rang the warrior’s voice; inspired for war,\nHe raves to slay, as doth a Bacchanal,\nHis very glance a terror! of such wight\nBeware the onset! closing on the gates,\nHe peals his vaunting and appalling cry!\nETEOCLES.\nYet first our Pallas Onca—wardress she,\nPlanting her foot hard by her gate—shall stand,\nThe Maid against the ruffian, and repel\nHis force, as from her brood the mother-bird\nBeats back the wintered serpent’s venom’d fang\nAnd next, by her, is Oenops’ gallant son,\nHyperbius, chosen to confront this foe,\nReady to seek his fate at Fortune’s shrine!\nIn form, in valour, and in skill of arms,\nNone shall gainsay him. See how wisely well\nHermes hath set the brave against the strong!\nConfronted shall they stand, the shield of each\nBearing the image of opposing gods:\nOne holds aloft his Typhon breathing fire,\nBut, on the other’s shield, in symbol sits\nZeus, calm and strong, and fans his bolt to flame—\nZeus, seen of all, yet seen of none to fail!\nHowbeit, weak is trust reposed in Heaven—\nYet are we upon Zeus’ victorious side,\nThe foe, with those he worsted—if in sooth\nZeus against Typhon held the upper hand,\nAnd if Hyperbius, (as well may hap\nWhen two such foes such diverse emblems bear)\nHave Zeus upon his shield, a saving sign.\nCHORUS.\nHigh faith is mine that he whose shield\nBears, against Zeus, the thing of hate.\nThe giant Typhon, thus revealed,\nA monster loathed of gods eterne\nAnd mortal men—this doom shall earn\nA shattered skull, before the gate!\nTHE SPY.\nHeaven send it so!\nA fifth assailant now\nIs set against our fifth, the northern, gate,\nFronting the death-mound where Amphion lies\nThe child of Zeus.\nThis foeman vows his faith,\nUpon a mystic spear-head which he deems\nMore holy than a godhead and more sure\nTo find its mark than any glance of eye,\nThat, will they, nill they, he will storm and sack\nThe hold of the Cadmeans. Such his oath—\nHis, the bold warrior, yet of childish years,\nA bud of beauty’s foremost flower, the son\nOf Zeus and of the mountain maid. I mark\nHow the soft down is waxing on his cheek,\nThick and close-growing in its tender prime—\nIn name, not mood, is he a maiden’s child—\nParthenopaeus; large and bright his eyes\nBut fierce the wrath wherewith he fronts the gate:\nYet not unheralded he takes his stand\nBefore the portal; on his brazen shield,\nThe rounded screen and shelter of his form,\nI saw him show the ravening Sphinx, the fiend\nThat shamed our city—how it glared and moved,\nClamped on the buckler, wrought in high relief!\nAnd in its claws did a Cadmean bear—\nNor heretofore, for any single prey,\nSped she aloft, through such a storm of darts\nAs now awaits her. So our foe is here—\nLike, as I deem, to ply no stinted trade\nIn blood and broil, but traffick as is meet\nIn fierce exchange for his long wayfaring!\nETEOCLES.\nAh, may they meet the doom they think to bring—\nThey and their impious vaunts—from those on high!\nSo should they sink, hurled down to deepest death!\nThis foe, at least, by thee Arcadian styled,\nIs faced by one who bears no braggart sign,\nBut his hand sees to smite, where blows avail—\nActor, own brother to Hyperbius!\nHe will not let a boast without a blow\nStream through our gates and nourish our despair,\nNor give him way who on his hostile shield\nBears the brute image of the loathly Sphinx!\nBlocked at the gate, she will rebuke the man\nWho strives to thrust her forward, when she feels\nThick crash of blows, up to the city wall.\nWith Heaven’s goodwill, my forecast shall be true.\nCHORUS.\nHome to my heart the vaunting goes,\nAnd, quick with terror, on my head\nRises my hair, at sound of those\nWho wildly, impiously rave!\nIf gods there be, to them I plead—\nGive them to darkness and the grave.\nTHE SPY.\nFronting the sixth gate stands another foe,\nWisest of warriors, bravest among seers—\nSuch must I name Amphiaraus: he,\nSet steadfast at the Homoloid gate,\nBerates strong Tydeus with reviling words—\nThe man of blood, the bane of state and home,\nTo Argos, arch-allurer to all ill,\nEvoker of the fury-fiend of hell,\nDeath’s minister, and counsellor of wrong\nUnto Adrastus in this fatal field.\nAy, and with eyes upturned and mien of scorn\nHe chides thy brother Polynices too\nAt his desert, and once and yet again\nDwells hard and meaningly upon his name\nWhere it saith glory yet importeth feud.\nYea, such thou art in act, and such thy grace\nIn sight of Heaven, and such in aftertime\nThy fame, for lips and ears of mortal men!\n“He strove to sack the city of his sires\nAnd temples of her gods, and brought on her\nAn alien armament of foreign foes.\nThe fountain of maternal blood outpoured\nWhat power can staunch? even so, thy fatherland\nOnce by thine ardent malice stormed and ta’en,\nShall ne’er join force with thee.” For me, I know\nIt doth remain to let my blood enrich\nThe border of this land that loves me not—\nBlood of a prophet, in a foreign grave!\nNow, for the battle! I foreknow my doom,\nYet it shall be with honour. So he spake,\nThe prophet, holding up his targe of bronze\nWrought without blazon, to the ears of men\nWho stood around and heeded not his word.\nFor on no bruit and rumour of great deeds,\nBut on their doing, is his spirit set,\nAnd in his heart he reaps a furrow rich,\nWherefrom the foison of good counsel springs.\nAgainst him, send brave heart and hand of might,\nFor the god-lover is man’s fiercest foe.\nETEOCLES.\nOut on the chance that couples mortal men,\nLinking the just and impious in one!\nIn every issue, the one curse is this—\nCompanionship with men of evil heart!\nA baneful harvest, let none gather it!\nThe field of sin is rank, and brings forth death\nAt whiles a righteous man who goes aboard\nWith reckless mates, a horde of villainy,\nDies by one death with that detested crew;\nAt whiles the just man, joined with citizens\nRuthless to strangers, recking nought of Heaven,\nTrapped, against nature, in one net with them,\nDies by God’s thrust and all-including blow.\nSo will this prophet die, even Oecleus’ child,\nSage, just, and brave, and loyal towards Heaven,\nPotent in prophecy, but mated here\nWith men of sin, too boastful to be wise!\nLong is their road, and they return no more,\nAnd, at their taking-off, by hand of Zeus,\nThe prophet too shall take the downward way.\nHe will not—so I deem—assail the gate—\nNot as through cowardice or feeble will,\nBut as one knowing to what end shall be\nTheir struggle in the battle, if indeed\nFruit of fulfilment lie in Loxias’ word.\nHe speaketh not, unless to speak avails!\nYet, for more surety, we will post a man,\nStrong Lasthenes, as warder of the gate,\nStern to the foeman; he hath age’s skill,\nMated with youthful vigour, and an eye\nForward, alert; swift too his hand, to catch\nThe fenceless interval ’twixt shield and spear!\nYet man’s good fortune lies in hand of Heaven.\nCHORUS.\nUnto our loyal cry, ye gods, give ear!\nSave, save the city! turn away the spear,\nSend on the foemen fear!\nOutside the rampart fall they, rent and riven\nBeneath the bolt of heaven!\nTHE SPY.\nLast, let me name yon seventh antagonist,\nThy brother’s self, at the seventh portal set—\nHear with what wrath he imprecates our doom,\nVowing to mount the wall, though banished hence,\nAnd peal aloud the wild exulting cry—\nThe town is ta’en—then clash his sword with thine,\nGiving and taking death in close embrace,\nOr, if thou ’scapest, flinging upon thee,\nAs robber of his honour and his home,\nThe doom of exile such as he has borne.\nSo clamours he and so invokes the gods\nWho guard his race and home, to hear and heed\nThe curse that sounds in Polynices’ name!\nHe bears a round shield, fresh from forge and fire,\nAnd wrought upon it is a twofold sign—\nFor lo, a woman leads decorously\nThe figure of a warrior wrought in gold;\nAnd thus the legend runs—I Justice am,\nAnd I will bring the hero home again,\nTo hold once more his place within this town,\nOnce more to pace his sire’s ancestral hall.\nSuch are the symbols, by our foemen shown—\nNow make thine own decision, whom to send\nAgainst this last opponent! I have said—\nNor canst thou in my tidings find a flaw—\nThine is it, now, to steer the course aright.\nETEOCLES.\nAh me, the madman, and the curse of Heaven!\nAnd woe for us, the lamentable line\nOf Oedipus, and woe that in this house\nOur father’s curse must find accomplishment!\nBut now, a truce to tears and loud lament,\nLest they should breed a still more rueful wail!\nAs for this Polynices, named too well,\nSoon shall we know how his device shall end—\nWhether the gold-wrought symbols on his shield,\nIn their mad vaunting and bewildered pride,\nShall guide him as a victor to his home!\nFor had but Justice, maiden-child of Zeus,\nStood by his act and thought, it might have been!\nYet never, from the day he reached the light\nOut of the darkness of his mother’s womb,\nNever in childhood, nor in youthful prime,\nNor when his chin was gathering its beard,\nHath Justice hailed or claimed him as her own.\nTherefore I deem not that she standeth now\nTo aid him in this outrage on his home!\nMisnamed, in truth, were Justice, utterly,\nIf to impiety she lent her hand.\nSure in this faith, I will myself go forth\nAnd match me with him; who hath fairer claim?\nRuler, against one fain to snatch the rule,\nBrother with brother matched, and foe with foe,\nWill I confront the issue. To the wall!\nCHORUS.\nO thou true heart, O child of Oedipus,\nBe not, in wrath, too like the man whose name\nMurmurs an evil omen! ’Tis enough\nThat Cadmus’ clan should strive with Argos’ host,\nFor blood there is that can atone that stain!\nBut—brother upon brother dealing death—\nNot time itself can expiate the sin!\nETEOCLES.\nIf man find hurt, yet clasp his honour still,\n’Tis well; the dead have honour, nought beside.\nHurt, with dishonour, wins no word of praise!\nCHORUS.\nAh, what is thy desire?\nLet not the lust and ravin of the sword\nBear thee adown the tide accursed, abhorred!\nFling off thy passion’s rage, thy spirit’s prompting dire!\nETEOCLES.\nNay—since the god is urgent for our doom,\nLet Laius’ house, by Phoebus loathed and scorned,\nFollow the gale of destiny, and win\nIts great inheritance, the gulf of hell!\nCHORUS.\nRuthless thy craving is—\nCraving for kindred and forbidden blood\nTo be outpoured—a sacrifice imbrued\nWith sin, a bitter fruit of murderous enmities!\nETEOCLES.\nYea, my own father’s fateful Curse proclaims—\nA ghastly presence, and her eyes are dry—\nStrike! honour is the prize, not life prolonged!\nCHORUS.\nAh, be not urged of her! for none shall dare\nTo call thee coward, in thy throned estate!\nWill not the Fury in her sable pall\nPass outward from these halls, what time the gods\nWelcome a votive offering from our hands?\nETEOCLES.\nThe gods! long since they hold us in contempt,\nScornful of gifts thus offered by the lost!\nWhy should we fawn and flinch away from doom?\nCHORUS.\nNow, when it stands beside thee! for its power\nMay, with a changing gust of milder mood,\nTemper the blast that bloweth wild and rude\nAnd frenzied, in this hour!\nETEOCLES.\nAy, kindled by the curse of Oedipus—\nAll too prophetic, out of dreamland came\nThe vision, meting out our sire’s estate!\nCHORUS.\nHeed women’s voices, though thou love them not!\nETEOCLES.\nSay aught that may avail, but stint thy words.\nCHORUS.\nGo not thou forth to guard the seventh gate!\nETEOCLES.\nWords shall not blunt the edge of my resolve.\nCHORUS.\nYet the god loves to let the weak prevail.\nETEOCLES.\nThat to a swordsman, is no welcome word!\nCHORUS.\nShall thine own brother’s blood be victory’s palm?\nETEOCLES.\nIll which the gods have sent thou canst not shun!\n[Exit ETEOCLES.]\nCHORUS.\nI shudder in dread of the power, abhorred by the gods of high heaven,\nThe ruinous curse of the home till roof-tree and rafter be riven!\nToo true are the visions of ill, too true the fulfilment they bring\nTo the curse that was spoken of old by the frenzy and wrath of the king!\nHer will is the doom of the children, and Discord is kindled amain,\nAnd strange is the Lord of Division, who cleaveth the birthright in twain,—\nThe edged thing, born of the north, the steel that is ruthless and keen,\nDividing in bitter division the lot of the children of teen!\nNot the wide lowland around, the realm of their sire, shall they have,\nYet enough for the dead to inherit, the pitiful space of a grave!\nAh, but when kin meets kin, when sire and child,\nUnknowing, are defiled\nBy shedding common blood, and when the pit\nOf death devoureth it,\nDrinking the clotted stain, the gory dye—\nWho, who can purify?\nWho cleanse pollution, where the ancient bane\nRises and reeks again?\nWhilome in olden days the sin was wrought,\nAnd swift requital brought—\nYea on the children of the child came still\nNew heritage of ill!\nFor thrice Apollo spoke this word divine,\nFrom Delphi’s central shrine,\nTo Laius—Die thou childless! thus alone\nCan the land’s weal be won!\nBut vainly with his wife’s desire he strove,\nAnd gave himself to love,\nBegetting Oedipus, by whom he died,\nThe fateful parricide!\nThe sacred seed-plot, his own mother’s womb,\nHe sowed, his house’s doom,\nA root of blood! by frenzy lured, they came\nUnto their wedded shame.\nAnd now the waxing surge, the wave of fate,\nRolls on them, triply great—\nOne billow sinks, the next towers, high and dark,\nAbove our city’s bark—\nOnly the narrow barrier of the wall\nTotters, as soon to fall;\nAnd, if our chieftains in the storm go down,\nWhat chance can save the town?\nCurses, inherited from long ago,\nBring heavy freight of woe:\nRich stores of merchandise o’erload the deck,\nNear, nearer comes the wreck—\nAnd all is lost, cast out upon the wave,\nFloating, with none to save!\nWhom did the gods, whom did the chief of men,\nWhom did each citizen\nIn crowded concourse, in such honour hold,\nAs Oedipus of old,\nWhen the grim fiend, that fed on human prey,\nHe took from us away?\nBut when, in the fulness of days, he knew of his bridal unblest,\nA twofold horror he wrought, in the frenzied despair of his breast—\nDebarred from the grace of the banquet, the service of goblets of gold,\nHe flung on his children a curse for the splendour they dared to withhold,\nA curse prophetic and bitter—The glory of wealth and of pride,\nWith iron, not gold, in your hands, ye shall come, at the last, to divide!\nBehold, how a shudder runs through me, lest now, in the fulness of time,\nThe house-fiend awake and return, to mete out the measure of crime!\nEnter THE SPY.\nTHE SPY.\nTake heart, ye daughters whom your mothers’ milk\nMade milky-hearted! lo, our city stands,\nSaved from the yoke of servitude: the vaunts\nOf overweening men are silent now,\nAnd the State sails beneath a sky serene,\nNor in the manifold and battering waves\nHath shipped a single surge, and solid stands\nThe rampart, and the gates are made secure,\nEach with a single champion’s trusty guard.\nSo in the main and at six gates we hold\nA victory assured; but, at the seventh,\nThe god that on the seventh day was born,\nRoyal Apollo, hath ta’en up his rest\nTo wreak upon the sons of Oedipus\nTheir grandsire’s wilfulness of long ago.\nCHORUS.\nWhat further woefulness besets our home?\nTHE SPY.\nThe home stands safe—but ah, the princes twain—\nCHORUS.\nWho? what of them? I am distraught with fear.\nTHE SPY.\nHear now, and mark! the sons of Oedipus—\nCHORUS.\nAh, my prophetic soul! I feel their doom.\nTHE SPY.\nHave done with questions!—with their lives crushed out—\nCHORUS.\nLie they out yonder? the full horror speak!\nDid hands meet hands more close than brotherly?\nCame fate on each, and in the selfsame hour?\nTHE SPY.\nYea, blotting out the lineage ill-starred!\nNow mix your exultation and your tears,\nOver a city saved, the while its lords,\nTwin leaders of the fight, have parcelled out\nWith forged arbitrament of Scythian steel\nThe full division of their fatherland,\nAnd, as their father’s imprecation bade,\nShall have their due of land, a twofold grave.\nSo is the city saved; the earth has drunk\nBlood of twin princes, by each other slain.\nCHORUS.\nO mighty Zeus and guardian powers,\nThe strength and stay of Cadmus’ towers!\nShall I send forth a joyous cry,\nHail to the lord of weal renewed?\nOr weep the misbegotten twain,\nBorn to a fatal destiny?\nEach numbered now among the slain,\nEach dying in ill fortitude,\nEach truly named, each child of feud?\nO dark and all-prevailing ill,\nThat broods o’er Oedipus and all his line,\nNumbing my heart with mortal chill!\nAh me, this song of mine,\nWhich, Thyad-like, I woke, now falleth still,\nOr only tells of doom,\nAnd echoes round a tomb!\nDead are they, dead! in their own blood they lie—\nIll-omened the concent that hails our victory!\nThe curse a father on his children spake\nHath faltered not, nor failed!\nNought, Laius! thy stubborn choice availed—\nFirst to beget, then, in the after day\nAnd for the city’s sake,\nThe child to slay!\nFor nought can blunt nor mar\nThe speech oracular!\nChildren of teen! by disbelief ye erred—\nYet in wild weeping came fulfilment of the word!\nANTIGONE and ISMENE approach with a train of mourners, bearing the bodies of ETEOCLES and POLYNICES.\nLook up, look forth! the doom is plain,\nNor spake the messenger in vain!\nA twofold sorrow, twofold strife—\nEach brave against a brother’s life!\nIn double doom hath sorrow come—\nHow shall I speak it?—on the home!\nAlas, my sisters! be your sighs the gale,\nThe smiting of your brows the plash of oars,\nWafting the boat, to Acheron’s dim shores\nThat passeth ever, with its darkened sail,\nOn its uncharted voyage and sunless way,\nFar from thy beams, Apollo, god of day—\nThe melancholy bark\nBound for the common bourn, the harbour of the dark!\nLook up, look yonder! from the home\nAntigone, Ismene come,\nOn the last, saddest errand bound,\nTo chant a dirge of doleful sound,\nWith agony of equal pain\nAbove their brethren slain!\nTheir sister-bosoms surely swell,\nHeart with rent heart according well\nIn grief for those who fought and fell!\nYet—ere they utter forth their woe—\nWe must awake the rueful strain\nTo vengeful powers, in realms below,\nAnd mourn hell’s triumph o’er the slain!\nAlas! of all, the breast who bind,—\nYea, all the race of womankind—\nO maidens, ye are most bereaved!\nFor you, for you the tear-drops start—\nDeem that in truth, and undeceived,\nYe hear the sorrows of my heart!\n(To the dead.)\nChildren of bitterness, and sternly brave—\nOne, proud of heart against persuasion’s voice,\nOne, against exile proof!

    "content":"THE SUPPLIANT MAIDENS\nDEDICATION\nTake thou this gift from out the grave of Time.\nThe urns of Greece lie shattered, and the cup\nThat for Athenian lips the Muses filled,\nAnd flowery crowns that on Athenian hair\nHid the cicala, freedom’s golden sign,\nDust in the dust have fallen. Calmly sad,\nThe marble dead upon Athenian tombs\nSpeak from their eyes “Farewell”: and well have fared\nThey and the saddened friends, whose clasping hands\nWin from the solemn stone eternity.\nYea, well they fared unto the evening god,\nPassing beyond the limit of the world,\nWhere face to face the son his mother saw,\nA living man a shadow, while she spake\nWords that Odysseus and that Homer heard,—\nI too, O child, I reached the common doom,\nThe grave, the goal of fate, and passed away.\n—Such, Anticleia, as thy voice to him,\nAcross the dim gray gulf of death and time\nIs that of Greece, a mother’s to a child,—\nMother of each whose dreams are grave and fair—\nWho sees the Naiad where the streams are bright\nAnd in the sunny ripple of the sea\nCymodoce with floating golden hair:\nAnd in the whisper of the waving oak\nHears still the Dryad’s plaint, and, in the wind\nThat sighs through moonlit woodlands, knows the horn\nOf Artemis, and silver shafts and bow.\nTherefore if still around this broken vase,\nBorne by rough hands, unworthy of their load,\nFar from Cephisus and the wandering rills,\nThere cling a fragrance as of things once sweet,\nOf honey from Hymettus’ desert hill,\nTake thou the gift and hold it close and dear;\nFor gifts that die have living memories—\nVoices of unreturning days, that breathe\nThe spirit of a day that never dies.\nARGUMENT\nIo, the daughter of Inachus, King of Argos, was beloved of Zeus. But Hera was jealous of that love, and by her ill will was Io given over to frenzy, and her body took the semblance of a heifer: and Argus, a many-eyed herdsman, was set by Hera to watch Io whithersoever she strayed. Yet, in despite of Argus, did Zeus draw nigh unto her in the shape of a bull. And by the will of Zeus and the craft of Hermes was Argus slain. Then Io was driven over far lands and seas by her madness, and came at length to the land of Egypt. There was she restored to herself by a touch of the hand of Zeus, and bare a child called Epaphus. And from Epaphus sprang Libya, and from Libya, Belus; and from Belus, Aegyptus and Danaus. And the sons of Aegyptus willed to take the daughters of Danaus in marriage. But the maidens held such wedlock in horror, and fled with their father over the sea to Argos; and the king and citizens of Argos gave them shelter and protection from their pursuers.\nTHE SUPPLIANT MAIDENS\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nDANAUS.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nChorus of the Daughters of Danaus.\nAttendants.\nScene.—A sacred precinct near the gates of Argos: statue and shrines of Zeus and other deities stand around.\nCHORUS.\nZeus! Lord and guard of suppliant hands!\nLook down benign on us who crave\nThine aid—whom winds and waters drave\nFrom where, through drifting shifting sands,\nPours Nilus to the wave.\nFrom where the green land, god-possest,\nCloses and fronts the Syrian waste,\nWe flee as exiles, yet unbanned\nBy murder’s sentence from our land;\nBut—since Aegyptus had decreed\nHis sons should wed his brother’s seed,—\nOurselves we tore from bonds abhorred,\nFrom wedlock not of heart but hand,\nNor brooked to call a kinsman lord!\nAnd Danaus, our sire and guide,\nThe king of counsel, pond’ring well\nThe dice of fortune as they fell,\nOut of two griefs the kindlier chose,\nAnd bade us fly, with him beside,\nHeedless what winds or waves arose,\nAnd o’er the wide sea waters haste,\nUntil to Argos’ shore at last\nOur wandering pinnace came—\nArgos, the immemorial home\nOf her from whom we boast to come—\nIo, the ox-horned maiden, whom,\nAfter long wandering, woe, and scathe,\nZeus with a touch, a mystic breath,\nMade mother of our name.\nTherefore, of all the lands of earth,\nOn this most gladly step we forth,\nAnd in our hands aloft we bear—\nSole weapon for a suppliant’s wear—\nThe olive-shoot, with wool enwound!\nCity, and land, and waters wan\nOf Inachus, and gods most high,\nAnd ye who, deep beneath the ground,\nBring vengeance weird on mortal man,\nPowers of the grave, on you we cry!\nAnd unto Zeus the Saviour, guard\nOf mortals’ holy purity!\nReceive ye us—keep watch and ward\nAbove the suppliant maiden band!\nChaste be the heart of this your land\nTowards the weak! but, ere the throng,\nThe wanton swarm, from Egypt sprung,\nLeap forth upon the silted shore,\nThrust back their swift-rowed bark again,\nRepel them, urge them to the main!\nAnd there, ’mid storm and lightning’s shine,\nAnd scudding drift and thunder’s roar,\nDeep death be theirs, in stormy brine!\nBefore they foully grasp and win\nUs, maiden-children of their kin,\nAnd climb the couch by law denied,\nAnd wrong each weak reluctant bride.\nAnd now on her I call,\nMine ancestress, who far on Egypt’s shore\nA young cow’s semblance wore,—\nA maiden once, by Hera’s malice changed!\nAnd then on him withal,\nWho, as amid the flowers the grazing creature ranged,\nWas in her by a breath of Zeus conceived;\nAnd, as the hour of birth drew nigh,\nBy fate fulfilled, unto the light he came;\nAnd Epaphus for name,\nBorn from the touch of Zeus, the child received.\nOn him, on him I cry,\nAnd him for patron hold—\nWhile in this grassy vale I stand,\nWhere Io roamed of old!\nAnd here, recounting all her toil and pain,\nSigns will I show to those who rule the land\nThat I am child of hers; and all shall understand,\nHearing the doubtful tale of the dim past made plain.\nAnd, ere the end shall be,\nEach man the truth of what I tell shall see.\nAnd if there dwell hard by\nOne skilled to read from bird-notes augury,\nThat man, when through his ears shall thrill our tearful wail,\nShall deem he hears the voice, the plaintive tale\nOf her, the piteous spouse of Tereus, lord of guile—\nWhom the hawk harries yet, the mourning nightingale.\nShe, from her happy home and fair streams scared away,\nWails wild and sad for haunts beloved erewhile.\nYea, and for Itylus—ah, well-a-day!\nSlain by her own, his mother’s hand,\nMaddened by lustful wrong, the deed by Tereus planned.\nLike her I wail and wail, in soft Ionian tones,\nAnd as she wastes, even so\nWastes my soft cheek, once ripe with Nilus’ suns\nAnd all my heart dissolves in utter woe\nSad flowers of grief I cull,\nFleeing from kinsmen’s love unmerciful—\nYea, from the clutching hands, the wanton crowd,\nI sped across the waves, from Egypt’s land of cloud[1]\nGods of the ancient cradle of my race,\nHear me, just gods! With righteous grace\nOn me, on me look down!\nGrant not to youth its heart’s unchaste desire,\nBut, swiftly spurning lust’s unholy fire,\nBless only love and willing wedlock’s crown\nThe war-worn fliers from the battle’s wrack\nFind refuge at the hallowed altar-side,\nThe sanctuary divine,—\nYe gods! such refuge unto me provide—\nSuch sanctuary be mine!\nThough the deep will of Zeus be hard to track,\nYet doth it flame and glance,\nA beacon in the dark, ’mid clouds of chance\nThat wrap mankind\nYea, though the counsel fall, undone it shall not be,\nWhate’er be shaped and fixed within Zeus’ ruling mind—\nDark as a solemn grove, with sombre leafage shaded,\nHis paths of purpose wind,\nA marvel to man’s eye\nSmitten by him, from towering hopes degraded,\nMortals lie low and still\nTireless and effortless, works forth its will\nThe arm divine!\nGod from His holy seat, in calm of unarmed power,\nBrings forth the deed, at its appointed hour!\nLet Him look down on mortal wantonness!\nLo! how the youthful stock of Belus’ line\nCraves for me, uncontrolled—\nWith greed and madness bold—\nUrged on by passion’s sunless stress—\nAnd, cheated, learns too late the prey has ’scaped their hold!\nAh, listen, listen to my grievous tale,\nMy sorrow’s words, my shrill and tearful cries!\nAh woe, ah woe!\nLoud with lament the accents use,\nAnd from my living lips my own sad dirges flow!\nO Apian land of hill and dale,\nThou kennest yet, O land, this faltered foreign wail—\nHave mercy, hear my prayer!\nLo, how again, again, I rend and tear\nMy woven raiment, and from off my hair\nCast the Sidonian veil!\nAh, but if fortune smile, if death be driven away,\nVowed rites, with eager haste, we to the gods will pay!\nAlas, alas again!\nO wither drift the waves? and who shall loose the pain?\nO Apian land of hill and dale,\nThou kennest yet, O land, this faltered foreign wail!\nHave mercy, hear my prayer!\nLo, how again, again, I rend and tear\nMy woven raiment, and from off my hair\nCast the Sidonian veil!\nThe wafting oar, the bark with woven sail,\nFrom which the sea foamed back,\nSped me, unharmed of storms, along the breeze’s track—\nBe it unblamed of me!\nBut ah, the end, the end of my emprise!\nMay He, the Father, with all-seeing eyes,\nGrant me that end to see!\nGrant that henceforth unstained as heretofore\nI may escape the forced embrace\nOf those proud children of the race\nThat sacred Io bore.\nAnd thou, O maiden-goddess chaste and pure—\nQueen of the inner fane,—\nLook of thy grace on me, O Artemis,\nThy willing suppliant—thine, thine it is,\nWho from the lustful onslaught fled secure,\nTo grant that I too without stain\nThe shelter of thy purity may gain!\nGrant that henceforth unstained as heretofore\nI may escape the forced embrace\nOf those proud children of the race\nThat sacred Io bore!\nYet if this may not be,\nWe, the dark race sun-smitten, we\nWill speed with suppliant wands\nTo Zeus who rules below, with hospitable hands\nWho welcomes all the dead from all the lands:\nYea by our own hands strangled, we will go,\nSpurned by Olympian gods, unto the gods below!\nZeus, hear and save!\nThe searching, poisonous hate, that Io vexed and drave,\nWas of a goddess: well I know\nThe bitter ire, the wrathful woe\nOf Hera, queen of heaven—\nA storm, a storm her breath, whereby we yet are driven!\nBethink thee, what dispraise\nOf Zeus himself mankind will raise,\nIf now he turn his face averted from our cries!\nIf now, dishonoured and alone,\nThe ox-horned maiden’s race shall be undone,\nChildren of Epaphus, his own begotten son—\nZeus, listen from on high!—to thee our prayers arise.\nZeus, hear and save!\nThe searching poisonous hate, that Io vexed and drave,\nWas of a goddess: well I know\nThe bitter ire, the wrathful woe\nOf Hera, queen of heaven—\nA storm, a storm her breath, whereby we yet are driven!\nDANAUS.\nChildren, be wary—wary he with whom\nYe come, your trusty sire and steersman old:\nAnd that same caution hold I here on land,\nAnd bid you hoard my words, inscribing them\nOn memory’s tablets. Lo, I see afar\nDust, voiceless herald of a host, arise;\nAnd hark, within their grinding sockets ring\nAxles of hurrying wheels! I see approach,\nBorne in curved cars, by speeding horses drawn,\nA speared and shielded band. The chiefs, perchance,\nOf this their land are hitherward intent\nTo look on us, of whom they yet have heard\nBy messengers alone. But come who may,\nAnd come he peaceful or in ravening wrath\nSpurred on his path, ’twere best, in any case,\nDamsels, to cling unto this altar-mound\nMade sacred to their gods of festival,—\nA shrine is stronger than a tower to save,\nA shield that none may cleave. Step swift thereto,\nAnd in your left hands hold with reverence\nThe white-crowned wands of suppliance, the sign\nBeloved of Zeus, compassion’s lord, and speak\nTo those that question you, words meek and low\nAnd piteous, as beseems your stranger state,\nClearly avowing of this flight of yours\nThe bloodless cause; and on your utterance\nSee to it well that modesty attend;\nFrom downcast eyes, from brows of pure control,\nLet chastity look forth; nor, when ye speak,\nBe voluble nor eager—they that dwell\nWithin this land are sternly swift to chide.\nAnd be your words submissive: heed this well;\nFor weak ye are, outcasts on stranger lands,\nAnd froward talk beseems not strengthless hands.\nCHORUS.\nO father, warily to us aware\nThy words are spoken, and thy wisdom’s best\nMy mind shall hoard, with Zeus our sire to aid.\nDANAUS.\nEven so—with gracious aspect let him aid.\nCHORUS.\nFain were I now to seat me by thy side.\nDANAUS.\nNow dally not, but put our thought in act.\nCHORUS.\nZeus, pity our distress, or e’er we die.\nDANAUS.\nIf so he will, your toils to joy will turn.\nCHORUS.\nLo, on this shrine, the semblance of a bird.[2]\nDANAUS.\nZeus’ bird of dawn it is; invoke the sign.\nCHORUS.\nThus I invoke the saving rays of morn.\nDANAUS.\nNext, bright Apollo, exiled once from heaven.\nCHORUS.\nThe exiled god will pity our exile.\nDANAUS.\nYea, may he pity, giving grace and aid.\nCHORUS.\nWhom next invoke I, of these other gods?\nDANAUS.\nLo, here a trident, symbol of a god.\nCHORUS.\nWho[3] gave sea-safety; may he bless on land!\nDANAUS.\nThis next is Hermes, carved in Grecian wise.\nCHORUS.\nThen let him herald help to freedom won.\nDANAUS.\nLastly, adore this altar consecrate\nTo many lesser gods in one; then crouch\nOn holy ground, a flock of doves that flee,\nScared by no alien hawks, a kin not kind,\nHateful, and fain of love more hateful still.\nFoul is the bird that rends another bird,\nAnd foul the men who hale unwilling maids,\nFrom sire unwilling, to the bridal bed.\nNever on earth, nor in the lower world,\nShall lewdness such as theirs escape the ban:\nThere too, if men say right, a God there is\nWho upon dead men turns their sin to doom,\nTo final doom. Take heed, draw hitherward,\nThat from this hap your safety ye may win.\nEnter the KING OF ARGOS.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSpeak—of what land are ye? No Grecian band\nIs this to whom I speak, with Eastern robes\nAnd wrappings richly dight: no Argive maid,\nNo woman in all Greece such garb doth wear.\nThis too gives marvel, how unto this land,\nUnheralded, unfriended, without guide,\nAnd without fear, ye came? yet wands I see,\nTrue sign of suppliance, by you laid down\nOn shrines of these our gods of festival.\nNo land but Greece can read such signs aright.\nMuch else there is, conjecture well might guess,\nBut let words teach the man who stands to hear.\nCHORUS.\nTrue is the word thou spakest of my garb;\nBut speak I unto thee as citizen,\nOr Hermes’ wandbearer, or chieftain king?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nFor that, take heart and answer without fear.\nI am Pelasgus, ruler of this land,\nChild of Palaichthon, whom the earth brought forth;\nAnd, rightly named from me, the race who reap\nThis country’s harvests are Pelasgian called.\nAnd o’er the wide and westward-stretching land,\nThrough which the lucent wave of Strymon flows\nI rule; Perrhaebia’s land my boundary is\nNorthward, and Pindus’ further slopes, that watch\nPaeonia, and Dodona’s mountain ridge.\nWest, east, the limit of the washing seas\nRestrains my rule—the interspace is mine.\nBut this whereon we stand is Apian land,\nStyled so of old from the great healer’s name;\nFor Apis, coming from Naupactus’ shore\nBeyond the strait, child of Apollo’s self\nAnd like him seer and healer, cleansed this land\nFrom man-devouring monsters, whom the earth,\nStained with pollution of old bloodshedding,\nBrought forth in malice, beasts of ravening jaws,\nA grisly throng of serpents manifold.\nAnd healings of their hurt, by knife and charm,\nApis devised, unblamed of Argive men,\nAnd in their prayers found honour, for reward.\n—Lo, thou hast heard the tokens that I give:\nSpeak now thy race, and tell a forthright tale;\nIn sooth, this people loves not many words.\nCHORUS.\nShort is my word and clear. Of Argive race\nWe come, from her, the ox-horned maiden who\nErst bare the sacred child. My word shall give\nWhate’er can ’stablish this my soothfast tale.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nO stranger maids, I may not trust this word,\nThat ye have share in this our Argive race.\nNo likeness of our country do ye bear,\nBut semblance as of Libyan womankind.\nEven such a stock by Nilus’ banks might grow;\nYea and the Cyprian stamp, in female forms,\nShows to the life, what males impressed the same.\nAnd, furthermore, of roving Indian maids\nWhose camping-grounds by Aethiopia lie,\nAnd camels burdened even as mules, and bearing\nRiders, as horses bear, mine ears have heard;\nAnd tales of flesh-devouring mateless maids\nCalled Amazons: to these, if bows ye bare,\nI most had deemed you like. Speak further yet,\nThat of your Argive birth the truth I learn.\nCHORUS.\nHere in this Argive land—so runs the tale—\nIo was priestess once of Hera’s fane.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nYea, truth it is, and far this word prevails:\nIs’t said that Zeus with mortal mingled love?\nCHORUS.\nAy, and that Hera that embrace surmised.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHow issued then this strife of those on high?\nCHORUS.\nBy Hera’s will, a heifer she became.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHeld Zeus aloof then from the horned beast?\nCHORUS.\n’Tis said, he loved, in semblance of a bull.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAnd his stern consort, did she aught thereon?\nCHORUS.\nOne myriad-eyed she set, the heifer’s guard.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHow namest thou this herdsman many-eyed?\nCHORUS.\nArgus, the child of Earth, whom Hermes slew.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nStill did the goddess vex the beast ill-starred?\nCHORUS.\nShe wrought a gadfly with a goading sting.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nThus drave she Io hence, to roam afar?\nCHORUS.\nYea—this thy word coheres exact with mine.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nThen to Canopus and to Memphis came she?\nCHORUS.\nAnd by Zeus’ hand was touched, and bare a child.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWho vaunts him the Zeus-mated creature’s son?\nCHORUS.\nEpaphus, named rightly from the saving touch.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAnd whom in turn did Epaphus beget?[4]\nCHORUS.\nLibya, with name of a wide land endowed.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAnd who from her was born unto the race?\nCHORUS.\nBelus: from him two sons, my father one.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSpeak now to me his name, this greybeard wise.\nCHORUS.\nRevere the gods thus crowned, who steer the State.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAwe thrills me, seeing these shrines with leafage crowned.\nCHORUS.\nYea, stern the wrath of Zeus, the suppliants’ lord.\nChild of Palaichthon, royal chief\nOf thy Pelasgians, hear!\nBow down thine heart to my relief—\nA fugitive, a suppliant, swift with fear,\nA creature whom the wild wolves chase\nO’er toppling crags; in piteous case\nAloud, afar she lows,\nCalling the herdsman’s trusty arm to save her from her foes!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nLo, with bowed heads beside our city shrines\nYe sit ’neath shade of new-plucked olive-boughs.\nOur distant kin’s resentment Heaven forefend!\nLet not this hap, unhoped and unforeseen,\nBring war on us: for strife we covet not.\nCHORUS.\nJustice, the daughter of right-dealing Zeus,\nJustice, the queen of suppliants, look down,\nThat this our plight no ill may loose\nUpon your town!\nThis word, even from the young, let age and wisdom learn:\nIf thou to suppliants show grace,\nThou shalt not lack Heaven’s grace in turn,\nSo long as virtue’s gifts on heavenly shrines have place.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nNot at my private hearth ye sit and sue;\nAnd if the city bear a common stain,\nBe it the common toil to cleanse the same:\nTherefore no pledge, no promise will I give,\nEre counsel with the commonwealth be held.\nCHORUS.\nNay, but the source of sway, the city’s self, art thou,\nA power unjudged! thine, only thine,\nTo rule the right of hearth and shrine!\nBefore thy throne and sceptre all men bow!\nThou, in all causes lord, beware the curse divine!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nMay that curse fall upon mine enemies!\nI cannot aid you without risk of scathe,\nNor scorn your prayers—unmerciful it were.\nPerplexed, distraught I stand, and fear alike\nThe twofold chance, to do or not to do.\nCHORUS.\nHave heed of him who looketh from on high,\nThe guard of woeful mortals, whosoe’er\nUnto their fellows cry,\nAnd find no pity, find no justice there.\nAbiding in his wrath, the suppliants’ lord\nDoth smite, unmoved by cries, unbent by prayerful word.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nBut if Aegyptus’ children grasp you here,\nClaiming, their country’s right, to hold you theirs\nAs next of kin, who dares to counter this?\nPlead ye your country’s laws, if plead ye may,\nThat upon you they lay no lawful hand.\nCHORUS.\nLet me not fall, O nevermore,\nA prey into the young men’s hand;\nRather than wed whom I abhor,\nBy pilot-stars I flee this land;\nO king, take justice to thy side,\nAnd with the righteous powers decide!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHard is the cause—make me not judge thereof.\nAlready I have vowed it, to do nought\nSave after counsel with my people ta’en,\nKing though I be; that ne’er in after time,\nIf ill fate chance, my people then may say—\nIn aid of strangers thou the state hast slain.\nCHORUS.\nZeus, lord of kinship, rules at will\nThe swaying balance, and surveys\nEvil and good; to men of ill\nGives evil, and to good men praise.\nAnd thou—since true those scales do sway—\nShall thou from justice shrink away?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nA deep, a saving counsel here there needs—\nAn eye that like a diver to the depth\nOf dark perplexity can pass and see,\nUndizzied, unconfused. First must we care\nThat to the State and to ourselves this thing\nShall bring no ruin; next, that wrangling hands\nShall grasp you not as prey, nor we ourselves\nBetray you thus embracing sacred shrines,\nNor make the avenging all-destroying god,\nWho not in hell itself sets dead men free,\nA grievous inmate, an abiding bane.—\nSpake I not right, of saving counsel’s need?\nCHORUS.\nYea, counsel take and stand to aid\nAt Justice’ side and mine.\nBetray not me, the timorous maid\nWhom far beyond the brine\nA godless violence cast forth forlorn.\nO King, wilt thou behold—\nLord of this land, wilt thou behold me torn\nFrom altars manifold?\nBethink thee of the young men’s wrath and lust,\nHold off their evil pride;\nSteel not thyself to see the suppliant thrust\nFrom hallowed statues’ side,\nHaled by the frontlet on my forehead bound,\nAs steeds are led, and drawn\nBy hands that drag from shrine and altar-mound\nMy vesture’s fringed lawn.\nKnow thou that whether for Aegyptus’ race\nThou dost their wish fulfil,\nOr for the gods and for each holy place—\nBe thy choice good or ill,\nBlow is with blow requited, grace with grace\nSuch is Zeus’ righteous will.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nYea, I have pondered: from the sea of doubt\nHere drives at length the bark of thought ashore;\nLandward with screw and windlass haled, and firm,\nClamped to her props, she lies. The need is stern;\nWith men or gods a mighty strife we strive\nPerforce, and either hap in grief concludes.\nFor, if a house be sacked, new wealth for old\nNot hard it is to win—if Zeus the lord\nOf treasure favour—more than quits the loss,\nEnough to pile the store of wealth full high;\nOr if a tongue shoot forth untimely speech,\nBitter and strong to goad a man to wrath,\nSoft words there be to soothe that wrath away:\nBut what device shall make the war of kin\nBloodless? that woe, the blood of many beasts,\nAnd victims manifold to many gods,\nAlone can cure. Right glad I were to shun\nThis strife, and am more fain of ignorance\nThan of the wisdom of a woe endured.\nThe gods send better than my soul foretells!\nCHORUS.\nOf many cries for mercy, hear the end.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSay on, then, for it shall not ’scape mine ear.\nCHORUS.\nGirdles we have, and bands that bind our robes.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nEven so; such things beseem a woman’s wear.\nCHORUS.\nKnow, then, with these a fair device there is—\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSpeak, then: what utterance doth this foretell?\nCHORUS.\nUnless to us thou givest pledge secure—\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWhat can thy girdles’ craft achieve for thee?\nCHORUS.\nStrange votive tablets shall these statues deck.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nMysterious thy resolve—avow it clear.\nCHORUS.\nSwiftly to hang me on these sculptured gods!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nThy word is as a lash to urge my heart.\nCHORUS.\nThou seest truth, for I have cleared thine eye\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nYea, and woes manifold, invincible,\nA crowd of ills, sweep on me torrent-like.\nMy bark goes forth upon a sea of troubles\nUnfathomed, ill to traverse, harbourless.\nFor if my deed shall match not your demand,\nDire, beyond shot of speech, shall be the bane\nYour death’s pollution leaves unto this land.\nYet if against your kin, Aegyptus’ race,\nBefore our gates I front the doom of war,\nWill not the city’s loss be sore? Shall men\nFor women’s sake incarnadine the ground?\nBut yet the wrath of Zeus, the suppliants’ lord\nI needs must fear: most awful unto man\nThe terror of his anger. Thou, old man,\nThe father of these maidens, gather up\nWithin your arms these wands of suppliance,\nAnd lay them at the altars manifold\nOf all our country’s gods, that all the town\nKnow, by this sign, that ye come here to sue.\nNor, in thy haste, do thou say aught of me.\nSwift is this folk to censure those who rule;\nBut, if they see these signs of suppliance,\nIt well may chance that each will pity you,\nAnd loathe the young men’s violent pursuit;\nAnd thus a fairer favour you may find:\nFor, to the helpless, each man’s heart is kind.\nDANAUS.\nTo us, beyond gifts manifold it is\nTo find a champion thus compassionate;\nYet send with me attendants, of thy folk,\nRightly to guide me, that I duly find\nEach altar of your city’s gods that stands\nBefore the fane, each dedicated shrine;\nAnd that in safety through the city’s ways\nI may pass onwards: all unlike to yours\nThe outward semblance that I wear—the race\nthat Nilus rears is all dissimilar\nThat of Inachus. Keep watch and ward\nLest heedlessness bring death: full oft, I ween,\nFriend hath slain friend, not knowing whom he slew.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nGo at his side, attendants,—he saith well.\nOn to the city’s consecrated shrines!\nNor be of many words to those ye meet,\nThe while this suppliant voyager ye lead.\n[Exit DANAUS with attendants.]\nCHORUS.\nLet him go forward, thy command obeying.\nBut me how biddest, how assurest thou?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nLeave there the new-plucked boughs, thy sorrow’s sign.\nCHORUS.\nThus beckoned forth, at thy behest I leave them.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nNow to this level precinct turn thyself.\nCHORUS.\nUnconsecrate it is, and cannot shield me.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWe will not yield thee to those falcons’ greed.\nCHORUS.\nWhat help? more fierce they are than serpents fell.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWe spake thee fair—speak thou them fair in turn.\nCHORUS.\nWhat marvel that we loathe them, scared in soul?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAwe towards a king should other fears transcend.\nCHORUS.\nThus speak, thus act, and reassure my mind.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nNot long thy sire shall leave thee desolate.\nBut I will call the country’s indwellers,\nAnd with soft words th’ assembly will persuade,\nAnd warn your sire what pleadings will avail.\nTherefore abide ye, and with prayer entreat\nThe country’s gods to compass your desire;\nThe while I go, this matter to provide,\nPersuasion and fair fortune at my side.\n[Exit the KING OF ARGOS.]\nCHORUS.\nO King of Kings, among the blest\nThou highest and thou happiest,\nListen and grant our prayer,\nAnd, deeply loathing, thrust\nAway from us the young men’s lust,\nAnd deeply drown\nIn azure waters, down and ever down,\nBenches and rowers dark,\nThe fatal and perfidious bark!\nUnto the maidens turn thy gracious care;\nThink yet again upon the tale of fame,\nHow from the maiden loved of thee there sprung\nMine ancient line, long since in many a legend sung!\nRemember, O remember, thou whose hand\nDid Io by a touch to human shape reclaim.\nFor from this Argos erst our mother came\nDriven hence to Egypt’s land,\nYet sprung of Zeus we were, and hence our birth we claim.\nAnd now have I roamed back\nUnto the ancient track\nWhere Io roamed and pastured among flowers,\nWatched o’er by Argus’ eyes,\nThrough the lush grasses and the meadow bowers.\nThence, by the gadfly maddened, forth she flies\nUnto far lands and alien peoples driven\nAnd, following fate, through paths of foam and surge,\nSees, as she goes, the cleaving strait divide\nGreece, from the Eastland riven.\nAnd swift through Asian borders doth she urge\nHer course, o’er Phrygian mountains’ sheep-clipt side;\nThence, where the Mysian realm of Teuthras lies\nTowards Lydian lowlands hies,\nAnd o’er Cilician and Pamphylian hills\nAnd ever-flowing rills,\nAnd thence to Aphrodite’s fertile shore,[5]\nThe land of garnered wheat and wealthy store\nAnd thence, deep-stung by wild unrest,\nBy the winged fly that goaded her and drave,\nUnto the fertile land, the god-possest,\n(Where, fed from far-off snows,\nLife-giving Nilus flows,\nUrged on by Typho’s strength, a fertilizing wave)\nShe roves, in harassed and dishonoured flight\nScathed by the blasting pangs of Hera’s dread despite.\nAnd they within the land\nWith terror shook and wanned,\nSo strange the sight they saw, and were afraid—\nA wild twy-natured thing, half heifer and half maid.\nWhose hand was laid at last on Io, thus forlorn,\nWith many roamings worn?\nWho bade the harassed maiden’s peace return?\nZeus, lord of time eterne.\nYea, by his breath divine, by his unscathing strength,\nShe lays aside her bane,\nAnd softened back to womanhood at length\nSheds human tears again.\nThen, quickened with Zeus’ veritable seed,\nA progeny she bare,\nA stainless babe, a child of heavenly breed.\nOf life and fortune fair.\nHis is the life of life—so all men say,—\nHis is the seed of Zeus.\nWho else had power stern Hera’s craft to stay,\nHer vengeful curse to loose?\nYea, all from Zeus befell!\nAnd rightly wouldst thou tell\nThat we from Epaphus, his child, were born:\nJustly his deed was done;\nUnto what other one,\nOf all the gods, should I for justice turn?\nFrom him our race did spring;\nCreator he and King,\nAncient of days and wisdom he, and might.\nAs bark before the wind,\nSo, wafted by his mind,\nMoves every counsel, each device aright.\nBeneath no stronger hand\nHolds he a weak command,\nNo throne doth he abase him to adore;\nSwift as a word, his deed\nActs out what stands decreed\nIn counsels of his heart, for evermore.\nRe-enter DANAUS.\nDANAUS.\nTake heart, my children: the land’s heart is kind,\nAnd to full issue has their voting come.\nCHORUS.\nAll hail, my sire; thy word brings utmost joy.\nSay, to what issue is the vote made sure,\nAnd how prevailed the people’s crowding hands?\nDANAUS.\nWith one assent the Argives spake their will,\nAnd, hearing, my old heart took youthful cheer,\nThe very sky was thrilled when high in air\nThe concourse raised right hands and swore their oath:—\nFree shall the maidens sojourn in this land.\nUnharried, undespoiled by mortal wight:\nNo native hand, no hand of foreigner\nShall drag them hence; if any man use force—\nWhoe’er of all our countrymen shall fail\nTo come unto their aid, let him go forth,\nBeneath the people’s curse, to banishment.\nSo did the king of this Pelasgian folk\nPlead on behalf of us, and bade them heed\nThat never, in the after-time, this realm\nShould feed to fulness the great enmity\nOf Zeus, the suppliants’ guard, against itself!\nA twofold curse, for wronging stranger-guests\nWho are akin withal, confrontingly\nShould rise before this city and be shown\nA ruthless monster, fed on human doom.\nSuch things the Argive people heard, and straight,\nWithout proclaim of herald, gave assent:\nYea, in full conclave, the Pelasgian folk\nHeard suasive pleas, and Zeus through them resolved.\nCHORUS.\nArouse we now to chant our prayer\nFor fair return of service fair\nAnd Argos’ kindly will.\nZeus, lord of guestright, look upon\nThe grace our stranger lips have won.\nIn right and truth, as they begun,\nGuide them, with favouring hand, until\nThou dost their blameless wish fulfil!\nNow may the Zeus-born gods on high\nHear us pour forth\nA votive prayer for Argos’ clan!—\nNever may this Pelasgian earth,\nAmid the fire-wrack, shrill the dismal cry\nOn Ares, ravening lord of fight,\nWho in an alien harvest mows down man!\nFor lo, this land had pity on our plight,\nAnd unto us were merciful and leal,\nTo us, the piteous flock, who at Zeus’ altar kneel!\nThey scornèd not the pleas of maidenhood,\nNor with the young men’s will hath their will stood.\nThey knew right well.\nTh’ unearthly watching fiend invincible,\nThe foul avenger—let him not draw near!\nFor he, on roofs ill-starred,\nDefiling and polluting, keeps a ghastly ward!\nThey knew his vengeance, and took holy heed\nTo us, the sister suppliants, who cry\nTo Zeus, the lord of purity:\nTherefore with altars pure they shall the gods revere.\nThus, through the boughs that shade our lips, fly forth in air,\nFly forth, O eager prayer!\nMay never pestilence efface\nThis city’s race,\nNor be the land with corpses strewed,\nNor stained with civic blood!\nThe stem of youth, unpluckt, to manhood come,\nNor Ares rise from Aphrodité’s bower,\nThe lord of death and bane, to waste our youthful flower.\nLong may the old\nCrowd to the altars kindled to consume\nGifts rich and manifold—\nOffered to win from powers divine\nA benison on city and on shrine:\nLet all the sacred might adore\nOf Zeus most high, the lord\nOf guestright and the hospitable board,\nWhose immemorial law doth rule Fate’s scales aright:\nThe garners of earth’s store\nBe full for evermore,\nAnd grace of Artemis make women’s travail light;\nNo devastating curse of fell disease\nThis city seize;\nNo clamour of the State arouse to war\nAres, from whom afar\nShrinketh the lute, by whom the dances fail—\nAres, the lord of wail.\nSwarm far aloof from Argos’ citizens\nAll plague and pestilence,\nAnd may the Archer-God our children spare!\nMay Zeus with foison and with fruitfulness\nThe land’s each season bless,\nAnd, quickened with Heaven’s bounty manifold,\nTeem grazing flock and fold.\nBeside the altars of Heaven’s hallowing\nLoud let the minstrels sing,\nAnd from pure lips float forth the harp-led strain in air!\nAnd let the people’s voice, the power\nThat sways the State, in danger’s hour\nBe wary, wise for all;\nNor honour in dishonour hold,\nBut—ere the voice of war be bold—\nLet them to stranger peoples grant\nFair and unbloody covenant—\nJustice and peace withal;\nAnd to the Argive powers divine\nThe sacrifice of laurelled kine,\nBy rite ancestral, pay.\nAmong three words of power and awe,\nStands this, the third, the mighty law—\nYour gods, your fathers deified,\nYe shall adore. Let this abide\nFor ever and for aye.\nDANAUS.\nDear children, well and wisely have ye prayed;\nI bid you now not shudder, though ye hear\nNew and alarming tidings from your sire.\nFrom this high place beside the suppliants’ shrine\nThe bark of our pursuers I behold,\nBy divers tokens recognized too well.\nLo, the spread canvas and the hides that screen\nThe gunwale; lo, the prow, with painted eyes\nThat seem her onward pathway to descry,\nHeeding too well the rudder at the stern\nThat rules her, coming for no friendly end.\nAnd look, the seamen—all too plain their race—\nTheir dark limbs gleam from out their snow-white garb;\nPlain too the other barks, a fleet that comes\nAll swift to aid the purpose of the first,\nThat now, with furled sail and with pulse of oars\nWhich smite the wave together, comes aland.\nBut ye, be calm, and, schooled not scared by fear,\nConfront this chance, be mindful of your trust\nIn these protecting gods. And I will hence,\nAnd champions who shall plead your cause aright\nWill bring unto your side. There come perchance\nHeralds or envoys, eager to lay hand\nAnd drag you captive hence; yet fear them not;\nFoiled shall they be. Yet well it were for you\n(If, ere with aid I come, I tarry long),\nNot by one step this sanctuary to leave.\nFarewell, fear nought: soon shall the hour be born\nWhen he that scorns the gods shall rue his scorn\nCHORUS.\nAh but I shudder, father!—ah, even now,\nEven as I speak, the swift-winged ships draw nigh!\nI shudder, I shiver, I perish with fear:\nOverseas though I fled,\nYet nought it avails; my pursuers are near!\nDANAUS.\nChildren, take heart; they who decreed to aid\nThy cause will arm for battle, well I ween.\nCHORUS.\nBut desperate is Aegyptus’ ravening race,\nWith fight unsated; thou too know’st it well.\nIn their wrath they o’ertake us; the prow is deep-dark\nIn the which they have sped,\nAnd dark is the bench and the crew of the bark!\nDANAUS.\nYea but a crew as stout they here shall find,\nAnd arms well steeled beneath a noon-day sun.\nCHORUS.\nAh yet, O father, leave us not forlorn!\nAlone, a maid is nought, a strengthless arm.\nWith guile they pursue me, with counsel malign,\nAnd unholy their soul;\nAnd as ravens they seize me, unheeding the shrine!\nDANAUS.\nFair will befall us, children, in this chance,\nIf thus in wrath they wrong the gods and you.\nCHORUS.\nAlas, nor tridents nor the sanctity\nOf shrines will drive them, O my sire, from us!\nUnholy and daring and cursed is their ire,\nNor own they control\nOf the gods, but like jackals they glut their desire!\nDANAUS.\nAy, but Come wolf, flee jackal, saith the saw;\nNor can the flax-plant overbear the corn.\nCHORUS.\nLustful, accursèd, monstrous is their will\nAs of beasts ravening—’ware we of their power!\nDANAUS.\nLook you, not swiftly puts a fleet to sea,\nNor swiftly to its moorings; long it is\nOr e’er the saving cables to the shore\nAre borne, and long or e’er the steersmen cry,\nThe good ship swings at anchor—all is well.\nLongest of all, the task to come aland\nWhere haven there is none, when sunset fades\nIn night. To pilot wise, the adage saith,\nNight is a day of wakefulness and pain.\nTherefore no force of weaponed men, as yet\nScatheless can come ashore, before the bank\nLie at her anchorage securely moored.\nBethink thee therefore, nor in panic leave\nThe shrine of gods whose succour thou hast won\nI go for aid—men shall not blame me long,\nOld, but with youth at heart and on my tongue.\n[Exit DANAUS.]\nCHORUS.\nO land of hill and dale, O holy land,\nWhat shall befall us? whither shall we flee,\nFrom Apian land to some dark lair of earth?\nO would that in vapour of smoke I might rise to the clouds of the sky,\nThat as dust which flits up without wings I might pass and evanish and die!\nI dare not, I dare not abide: my heart yearns, eager to fly;\nAnd dark is the cast of my thought; I shudder and tremble for fear.\nMy father looked forth and beheld: I die of the sight that draws near.\nAnd for me be the strangling cord, the halter made ready by Fate,\nBefore to my body draws nigh the man of my horror and hate.\nNay, ere I will own him as lord, as handmaid to Hades I go!\nAnd oh, that aloft in the sky, where the dark clouds are frozen to snow,\nA refuge for me might be found, or a mountain-top smooth and too high\nFor the foot of the goat, where the vulture sits lonely, and none may descry\nThe pinnacle veiled in the cloud, the highest and sheerest of all,\nEre to wedlock that rendeth my heart, and love that is loveless, I fall!\nYea, a prey to the dogs and the birds of the mount will I give me to be,—\nFrom wailing and curse and pollution it is death, only death, sets me free:\nLet death come upon me before to the ravisher’s bed I am thrust;\nWhat champion, what saviour but death can I find, or what refuge from lust?\nI will utter my shriek of entreaty, a prayer that shrills up to the sky,\nThat calleth the gods to compassion, a tuneful, a pitiful cry,\nThat is loud to invoke the releaser. O father, look down on the fight;\nLook down in thy wrath on the wronger, with eyes that are eager for right.\nZeus, thou that art lord of the world, whose kingdom is strong over all,\nHave mercy on us! At thine altar for refuge and safety we call.\nFor the race of Aegyptus is fierce, with greed and with malice afire;\nThey cry as the questing hounds, they sweep with the speed of desire.\nBut thine is the balance of fate, thou rulest the wavering scale,\nAnd without thee no mortal emprise shall have strength to achieve or prevail.\nAlack, alack! the ravisher—\nHe leaps from boat to beach, he draweth near!\nAway, thou plunderer accurst!\nDeath seize thee first,\nOr e’er thou touch me—off! God, hear our cry,\nOur maiden agony!\nAh, ah, the touch, the prelude of my shame.\nAlas, my maiden fame!\nO sister, sister, to the altar cling,\nFor he that seizeth me,\nGrim is his wrath and stern, by land as on the sea.\nGuard us, O king!\nEnter the HERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nHence to my barge—step swiftly, tarry not.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, he rends—he rends my hair! O wound on wound!\nHelp! my lopped head will fall, my blood gush o’er the ground!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nAboard, ye cursèd—with a new curse, go!\nCHORUS.\nWould God that on the wand’ring brine\nThou and this braggart tongue of thine\nHad sunk beneath the main—\nThy mast and planks, made fast in vain!\nThee would I drive aboard once more,\nA slayer and a dastard, from the shore!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nBe still, thou vain demented soul;\nMy force thy craving shall control.\nAway, aboard! What, clingest to the shrine?\nAway! this city’s gods I hold not for divine.\nCHORUS.\nAid me, ye gods, that never, never\nI may again behold\nThe mighty, the life-giving river,\nNilus, the quickener of field and fold!\nAlack, O sire, unto the shrine I cling—\nShrine of this land from which mine ancient line did spring!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nShrines, shrines, forsooth!—the ship, the ship be shrine!\nAboard, perforce and will-ye nill-ye, go!\nOr e’er from hands of mine\nYe suffer torments worse and blow on blow.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, God grant those hands may strive in vain\nWith the salt-streaming wave,\nWhen ’gainst the wide-blown blasts thy bark shall strain\nTo round Sarpedon’s cape, the sandbank’s treach’rous grave.\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nShrill ye and shriek unto what gods ye may,\nYe shall not leap from out Aegyptus’ bark,\nHow bitterly soe’er ye wail your woe.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, alack my wrong!\nStern is thy voice, thy vaunting loud and strong.\nThy sire, the mighty Nilus, drive thee hence\nTurning to death and doom thy greedy violence!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nSwift to the vessel of the double prow,\nGo quickly! let none linger, else this hand\nRuthless will hale you by your tresses hence.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, O father! from the shrine\nNot aid but agony is mine.\nAs a spider he creeps and he clutches his prey,\nAnd he hales me away.\nA spectre of darkness, of darkness.

Before the encampment of Aias on the shore of the Troad. Afterwards a lonely place beyond Rhoeteum.\nTime, towards the end of the Trojan War.\n[page 42]‘A wounded spirit who can bear?’\nAfter the death of Achilles, the armour made for him by Hephaestus was to be given to the worthiest of the surviving Greeks. Although Aias was the most valiant, the judges made the award to Odysseus, because he was the wisest.\nAias in his rage attempts to kill the generals; but Athena sends madness upon him, and he makes a raid upon the flocks and herds of the army, imagining the bulls and rams to be the Argive chiefs. On awakening from his delusion, he finds that he has fallen irrecoverably from honour and from the favour of the Greeks. He also imagines that the anger of Athena is unappeasable. Under this impression he eludes the loving eyes of his captive-bride Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian comrades, and falls on his sword. (‘The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.’)\nBut it is revealed through the prophet Calchas, that the wrath of Athena will last only for a day; and on the return of Teucer, Aias receives an honoured funeral, the tyrannical reclamations of the two sons of Atreus being overcome by the firm fidelity of Teucer and the magnanimity of Odysseus, who has been inspired for this purpose by Athena.\n[page 43]\nAIAS\nATHENA (above). ODYSSEUS.\nATHENA. Oft have I seen thee, Laërtiades,\nIntent on some surprisal of thy foes;\nAs now I find thee by the seaward camp,\nWhere Aias holds the last place in your line,\nLingering in quest, and scanning the fresh print\nOf his late footsteps, to be certified\nIf he keep house or no. Right well thy sense\nHath led thee forth, like some keen hound of Sparta!\nThe man is even but now come home, his head\nAnd slaughterous hands reeking with ardent toil.\nThou, then, no longer strain thy gaze within\nYon gateway, but declare what eager chase\nThou followest, that a god may give thee light.\nODYSSEUS. Athena, ’tis thy voice! Dearest in heaven,\nHow well discerned and welcome to my soul\nFrom that dim distance doth thine utterance fly\nIn tones as of Tyrrhenian trumpet clang!\nRightly hast thou divined mine errand here,\nBeating this ground for Aias of the shield,\nThe lion-quarry whom I track to day.\nFor he hath wrought on us to night a deed\nPast thought—if he be doer of this thing;\nWe drift in ignorant doubt, unsatisfied—\nAnd I unbidden have bound me to this toil.\nBrief time hath flown since suddenly we knew\nThat all our gathered spoil was reaved and slaughtered,\nFlocks, herds, and herdmen, by some human hand,\nAll tongues, then, lay this deed at Aias’ door.\nAnd one, a scout who had marked him, all alone,\nWith new-fleshed weapon bounding o’er the plain,\n[page 44][31-66]Gave me to know it, when immediately\nI darted on the trail, and here in part\nI find some trace to guide me, but in part\nI halt, amazed, and know not where to look.\nThou com’st full timely. For my venturous course,\nPast or to come, is governed by thy will.\nATH. I knew thy doubts, Odysseus, and came forth\nZealous to guard thy perilous hunting-path.\nOD. Dear Queen! and am I labouring to an end?\nATH. Thou schem’st not idly. This is Aias’ deed.\nOD. What can have roused him to a work so wild?\nATH. His grievous anger for Achilles’ arms.\nOD. But wherefore on the flock this violent raid?\nATH. He thought to imbrue his hands with your heart’s blood.\nOD. What? Was this planned against the Argives, then?\nATH. Planned, and performed, had I kept careless guard.\nOD. What daring spirit, what hardihood, was here!\nATH. Alone by night in craft he sought your tents.\nOD. How? Came he near them? Won he to his goal?\nATH. He stood in darkness at the generals’ gates.\nOD. What then restrained his eager hand from murder?\nATH. I turned him backward from his baleful joy,\nAnd overswayed him with blind phantasies,\nTo swerve against the flocks and well-watched herd\nNot yet divided from the public booty.\nThere plunging in he hewed the horned throng,\nAnd with him Havoc ranged: while now he thought\nTo kill the Atreidae with hot hand, now this\nNow that commander, as the fancy grew.\nI, joining with the tumult of his mind,\nFlung the wild victim on the fatal net.\nAnon, this toil being overpast, he draws\nThe living oxen and the panting sheep\nWith cords to his home, not as a hornèd prey,\nBut as in triumph marshalling his foes:\nWhom now he tortures in their bonds within.\nCome, thou shalt see this madness in clear day,\n[page 45][67-100]And tell to the Argives all I show thee here\nOnly stand firm and shrink not, I will turn\nHis eyes askance, not to distinguish thee,\nFear nought—Ho! thou that bindest to thy will\nThe limbs of those thy captives, come thou forth!\nAias! advance before thy palace gate!\nOD. My Queen! what dost thou? Never call him forth.\nATH. Hush, hush! Be not so timorous, but endure.\nOD. Nay, nay! Enough. He is there, and let him bide.\nATH. What fear you? Dates his valour from to day?\nOD. He was and is my valiant enemy.\nATH. Then is not laughter sweetest o’er a foe?\nOD. No more! I care not he should pass abroad.\nATH. You flinch from seeing the madman in full view.\nOD. When sane, I ne’er had flinched before his face.\nATH. Well, but even now he shall not know thee near.\nOD. How, if his eyes be not transformed or lost?\nATH. I will confound his sense although he see.\nOD. Well, nothing is too hard for Deity.\nATH. Stand still and keep thy place without a word.\nOD. I must. Would I were far away from here!\nATH. Aias! Again I summon thee. Why pay\nSo scanty heed to her who fights for thee?\nEnter AIAS with a bloody scourge.\nAIAS. Hail, offspring of the Highest! Pallas, hail!\nWell hast thou stood by me. Triumphal gold\nShall crown thy temple for this lordly prey.\nATH. A fair intention! But resolve me this:\nHast dyed thy falchion deep in Argive blood?\nAI. There is my boast; that charge I’ll ne’er deny.\nATH. Have Atreus’ sons felt thy victorious might?\nAI. They have. No more they’ll make a scorn of me!\nATH. I take it, then, they are dead.\nAI. Ay, now they are dead,\nLet them arise and rob me of mine arms!\n[page 46][101-133]ATH. Good. Next inform us of Laërtes’ son;\nHow stands his fortune? Hast thou let him go?\nAI. The accursed fox! Dost thou inquire of him?\nATH. Ay, of Odysseus, thy late adversary.\nAI. He sits within, dear lady, to my joy,\nBound; for I mean him not just yet to die.\nATH. What fine advantage wouldst thou first achieve?\nAI. First, tie him to a pillar of my hall—\nATH. Poor wretch! What torment wilt thou wreak on him?\nAI. Then stain his back with scourging till he die.\nATH. Nay, ’tis too much. Poor caitiff! Not the scourge!\nAI. Pallas, in all things else have thou thy will,\nBut none shall wrest Odysseus from this doom.\nATH. Well, since thou art determined on the deed,\nSpare nought of thine intent: indulge thy hand!\nAI. (waving the bloody scourge.)\nI go! But thou, I charge thee, let thine aid\nBe evermore like valiant as to-day.[Exit\nATH. The gods are strong, Odysseus. Dost thou see?\nWhat man than Aias was more provident,\nOr who for timeliest action more approved?\nOD. I know of none. But, though he hates me sore,\nI pity him, poor mortal, thus chained fast\nTo a wild and cruel fate,—weighing not so much\nHis fortune as mine own. For now I feel\nAll we who live are but an empty show\nAnd idle pageant of a shadowy dream.\nATH. Then, warned by what thou seest, be thou not rash\nTo vaunt high words toward Heaven, nor swell thy port\nToo proudly, if in puissance of thy hand\nThou passest others, or in mines of wealth.\nSince Time abases and uplifts again\nAll that is human, and the modest heart\nIs loved by Heaven, who hates the intemperate will.[Exeunt\n[page 47][134-156]\nCHORUS (entering).\nTelamonian child, whose hand\nGuards our wave-encircled land,\nSalamis that breasts the sea,\nGood of thine is joy to me;\nBut if One who reigns above\nSmite thee, or if murmurs move\nFrom fierce Danaäns in their hate\nFull of threatening to thy state,\nAll my heart for fear doth sigh,\nShrinking like a dove’s soft eye.\nHardly had the darkness waned,[Half-Chorus I.\nWhen our ears were filled and pained\nWith huge scandal on thy fame.\nTelling, thine the arm that came\nTo the cattle-browsèd mead,\nWild with prancing of the steed,\nAnd that ravaged there and slew\nWith a sword of fiery hue\nAll the spoils that yet remain,\nBy the sweat of spearmen ta’en.\nSuch report against thy life,[Half-Chorus II.\nWhispered words with falsehood rife,\nWise Odysseus bringing near\nShrewdly gaineth many an ear:\nSince invention against thee\nFindeth hearing speedily,\nTallying with the moment’s birth;\nAnd with loudly waxing mirth\nHeaping insult on thy grief,\nEach who hears it glories more\nThan the tongue that told before.\nEvery slander wins belief\nAimed at souls whose worth is chief:\nShot at me, or one so small,\nSuch a bolt might harmless fall.\n[page 48][157-192]Ever toward the great and high\nCreepeth climbing jealousy\nYet the low without the tall\nMake at need a tottering wall\nLet the strong the feeble save\nAnd the mean support the brave.\nCHORUS.\nAh! ’twere vain to tune such song\n’Mid the nought discerning throng\nWho are clamouring now ’gainst thee\nLong and loud, and strengthless we,\nMighty chieftain, thou away,\nTo withstand the gathering fray\nFlocking fowl with carping cry\nSeem they, lurking from thine eye,\nTill the royal eagle’s poise\nOverawe the paltry noise\nTill before thy presence hushed\nSudden sink they, mute and crushed.\nDid bull slaying Artemis, Zeus’ cruel daughterI 1\n(Ah, fearful rumour, fountain of my shame!)\nPrompt thy fond heart to this disastrous slaughter\nOf the full herd stored in our army’s name!\nSay, had her blood stained temple missed the kindness\nOf some vow promised fruit of victory,\nFoiled of some glorious armour through thy blindness,\nOr fell some stag ungraced by gift from thee?\nOr did stern Ares venge his thankless spear\nThrough this night foray that hath cost thee dear!\nFor never, if thy heart were not distractedI 2\nBy stings from Heaven, O child of Telamon,\nWouldst thou have bounded leftward, to have acted\nThus wildly, spoiling all our host hath won!\nMadness might fall some heavenly power forfend it\nBut if Odysseus and the tyrant lords\nSuggest a forged tale, O rise to end it,\nNor fan the fierce flame of their withering words!\n[page 49][201-226]Forth from thy tent, and let thine eye confound\nThe brood of Sisyphus that would thee wound!\nToo long hast thou been fixed in grim repose,III\nHeightening the haughty malice of thy foes,\nThat, while thou porest by the sullen sea,\nThrough breezy glades advanceth fearlessly,\nA mounting blaze with crackling laughter fed\nFrom myriad throats; whence pain and sorrow bred\nWithin my bosom are establishèd.\nEnter TECMESSA.\nTECMESSA. Helpers of Aias’ vessel’s speed,\nErechtheus’ earth-derivèd seed,\nSorrows are ours who truly care\nFor the house of Telamon afar.\nThe dread, the grand, the rugged form\nOf him we know,\nIs stricken with a troublous storm;\nOur Aias’ glory droopeth low.\nCHORUS. What burden through the darkness fell\nWhere still at eventide ’twas well?\nPhrygian Teleutas’ daughter, say;\nSince Aias, foremost in the fray,\nDisdaining not the spear-won bride,\nStill holds thee nearest at his side,\nAnd thou may’st solve our doubts aright.\nTEC. How shall I speak the dreadful word?\nHow shall ye live when ye have heard?\nMadness hath seized our lord by night\nAnd blasted him with hopeless blight.\nSuch horrid victims mightst thou see\nHuddled beneath yon canopy,\nTorn by red hands and dyed in blood,\nDread offerings to his direful mood.\nCH. What news of our fierce lord thy story showeth,1\nSharp to endure, impossible to fly!\nNews that on tongues of Danaäns hourly groweth,\nWhich Rumour’s myriad voices multiply!\n[page 50][227-266]Alas! the approaching doom awakes my terror.\nThe man will die, disgraced in open day,\nWhose dark dyed steel hath dared through mad brained error\nThe mounted herdmen with their herds to slay.\nTEC. O horror! Then ’twas there he found\nThe flock he brought as captives tied,\nAnd some he slew upon the ground,\nAnd some, side smiting, sundered wide\nTwo white foot rams he backward drew,\nAnd bound. Of one he shore and threw\nThe tipmost tongue and head away,\nThe other to an upright stay\nHe tied, and with a harness thong\nDoubled in hand, gave whizzing blows,\nEchoing his lashes with a song\nMore dire than mortal fury knows.\nCH. Ah! then ’tis time, our heads in mantles hiding,2\nOur feet on some stol’n pathway now to ply,\nOr with swift oarage o’er the billows gliding,\nWith ordered stroke to make the good ship fly\nSuch threats the Atridae, armed with two fold power,\nLaunch to assail us. Oh, I sadly fear\nStones from fierce hands on us and him will shower,\nWhose heavy plight no comfort may come near.\nTEC. ’Tis changed, his rage, like sudden blast,\nWithout the lightning gleam is past\nAnd now that Reason’s light returns,\nNew sorrow in his spirit burns.\nFor when we look on self made woe,\nIn which no hand but ours had part,\nThought of such griefs and whence they flow\nBrings aching misery to the heart.\nCH. If he hath ceased to rave, he should do well\nThe account of evil lessens when ’tis past.\nTEC. If choice were given you, would you rather choose\nHurting your friends, yourself to feel delight,\n[page 51][267-302]Or share with them in one commingled pain?\nCH. The two fold trouble is more terrible.\nTEC. Then comes our torment now the fit is o’er.\nCH. How mean’st thou by that word? I fail to see.\nTEC. He in his rage had rapture of delight\nAnd knew not how he grieved us who stood near\nAnd saw the madding tempest ruining him.\nBut now ’tis over and he breathes anew,\nThe counterblast of sorrow shakes his soul,\nWhilst our affliction vexeth as before,\nHave we not double for our single woe?\nCH. I feel thy reasoning move me, and I fear\nSome heavenly stroke hath fallen. How else, when the end\nOf stormy sickness brings no cheering ray?\nTEC. Our state is certain. Dream not but ’tis so.\nCH. How first began the assault of misery?\nTell us the trouble, for we share the pain.\nTEC. It toucheth you indeed, and ye shall hear\nAll from the first. ’Twas midnight, and the lamp\nOf eve had died, when, seizing his sharp blade,\nHe sought on some vain errand to creep forth.\nI broke in with my word: ‘Aias, what now?\nWhy thus uncalled for salliest thou? No voice\nOf herald summoned thee. No trumpet blew.\nWhat wouldst thou when the camp is hushed in sleep?’\nHe with few words well known to women’s ears\nChecked me: ‘The silent partner is the best.’\nI saw how ’twas and ceased. Forth then he fared\nAlone—What horror passed upon the plain\nThis night, I know not. But he drags within,\nTied in a throng, bulls, shepherd dogs, and spoil\nOf cattle and sheep. Anon he butchers them,\nFelling or piercing, hacking or tearing wide,\nRibs from breast, limb from limb. Others in rage\nHe seized and bound and tortured, brutes for men.\nLast, out he rushed before the doors, and there\nWhirled forth wild language to some shadowy form,\nFlouting the generals and Laërtes’ son\n[page 52][303-341]With torrent laughter and loud triumphing\nWhat in his raid he had wreaked to their despite.\nThen diving back within—the fitful storm\nSlowly assuaging left his spirit clear.\nAnd when his eye had lightened through the room\nCumbered with ruin, smiting on his brow\nHe roared; and, tumbling down amid the wreck\nOf woolly carnage he himself had made,\nSate with clenched hand tight twisted in his hair.\nLong stayed he so in silence. Then flashed forth\nThose frightful words of threatening vehemence,\nThat bade me show him all the night’s mishap,\nAnd whither he was fallen I, dear my friends,\nPrevailed on through my fear, told all I knew.\nAnd all at once he raised a bitter cry,\nWhich heretofore I ne’er had heard, for still\nHe made us think such doleful utterance\nBetokened the dull craven spirit, and still\nDumb to shrill wailings, he would only moan\nWith half heard muttering, like an angry bull.\nBut now, by such dark fortune overpowered,\nFoodless and dry, amid the quivering heap\nHis steel hath quelled, all quietly he broods;\nAnd out of doubt his mind intends some harm:\nSuch words, such groans, burst from him. O my friends.—\nTherefore I hastened,—enter and give aid\nIf aught ye can! Men thus forgone will oft\nGrow milder through the counsel of a friend.\nCH. Teleutas’ child! we shudder at thy tale\nThat fatal frenzy wastes our hero’s soul.\nAIAS (within). Woe’s me, me, me!\nTEC. More cause anon! Hear ye not Aias there,\nHow sharp the cry that shrills from him?\nAI. Woe! Woe!\nCH. Madly it sounds—Or springs it of deep grief\nFor proofs of madness harrowing to his eye?\nAI. Boy, boy!\nTEC. What means he? Oh, Eurysakes!\nHe cries on thee. Where art thou? O my heart!\n[page 53][342-376]AI. Teucer I call! Where ’s Teucer? Will he ne’er\nCome from the chase, but leave me to my doom?\nCH. Not madness now. Disclose him. Let us look.\nHaply the sight of us may calm his soul.\nTEC. There, then; I open to your view the form\nOf Aias, and his fortunes as they are.[AIAS is discovered\nAI. Dear comrades of the deep, whose truth and loveI 1\nStand forth alone unbroken in my woe,\nBehold what gory sea\nOf storm-lashed agony\nDoth round and round me flow!\nCH. (to TEC.). Too true thy witness: for the fact cries out\nWild thoughts were here and Reason’s lamp extinct.\nAI. Strong helpers of sea-speed, whose nimble handI 2\nPlied hither the salt oar with circling stroke,\nNo shepherd there was found\nTo give the avenging wound.\nCome, lay me with the flock!\nCH.

Child of Laërtes old,II 2\nThou that dost still behold\nAnd still contrive all shapes of monstrous ill,\nWinding in foulest ways\nThrough the army’s sinful maze,—\nNow even for pleasure thou may’st laugh thy fill.\nCH.

This mad prey\nShames me for evermore:\nVengeance is at the door;\nYea, all the Achaean host, with armèd hand,\nIs ready at command\nTo slay me o’er and o’er.\n[page 55][410-447]TEC.

Grey firths of foaming brine,III 2 And ye, deep groves, that crown\nThe sea-caves and long cliffs upon the shore,\nToo long did ye confine\nMy life about the walls of Troia’s town:\nBut no more now! a breathing man, no more!\nThe wise in heart may duly learn that lore.\nLet Xanthus know,\nWhose waters neighbouring flow,\nAnd minister to Argive men:\nOne man he ne’er shall see again;\nOne, I will vaunt it forth!\nHighest in warlike worth\nOf all Greek forms that Troia’s towers have eyed:\nNow, shorn of all that pride,\nI lie thus low.\nCH. I know not how to let thee speak, nor how\nTo silence thee. Such evils close thee round.\nAI. Ay me!\nCould human thought have prophesied\nMy name would thus give echo to mine ill?\n‘Ai’ now for Aias, doubly, trebly said,\nSorts all too well to mark my misery;\nWhose father from this land of Troy, as noblest\nOf all the host, carrying the fairest prize,\nCame girt about with glory to his home.\nBut I his son, not less of might than he,\nNor poorer in the achievements of my hand,\nTo this same region following in my prime,\nAm scouted by the Achaeans and destroyed.\nYet know I one thing well. Had Peleus’ child,\nLiving, adjudged his armour as a meed\nOf well-tried bravery, no grasp save mine\nHad clutched it. But the Atridae with mean craft\nConveyed his heirloom to a wit-proud knave,\nWhilst Aias’ peerless prowess was despised.\nAnd had not this mine eye and mind distraught\n[page 56][448-486]Glanced from my purpose, ne’er again had they\nPerverted judgement. But the invincible\nStern daughter of the Highest, with baneful eye,\nEven as mine arm descended, baffled me,\nAnd hurled upon my soul a frenzied plague,\nTo stain my hand with these dumb victims’ blood.\nAnd those mine enemies exult in safety,—\nNot with my will; but where a God misguides,\nStrong arms are thwarted and the weakling lives.\nNow, what remains? Heaven hates me, ’tis too clear:\nThe Grecian host abhor me: Troy, with all\nThis country round our camp, is my sworn foe.\nShall I, across the Aegean sailing home,\nLeave these Atridae and their fleet forlorn?\nHow shall I dare to front my father’s eye?\nHow will he once endure to look on me,\nDenuded of the prize of high renown,\nWhose coronal stood sparkling on his brow?\nNo! ’twere too dreadful. Then shall I advance\nBefore the Trojan battlements, and there\nIn single conflict doing valiantly\nLast die upon their spears? Nay, for by this\nI might perchance make Atreus’ offspring glad.\nThat may not be imagined. I must find\nSome act to let my grey-haired father feel\nNo heartless recreant once called him sire.\nShame on the wight who when beset with ill\nCares to live on in misery unrelieved.\nCan hour outlasting hour make less or more\nOf death? Whereby then can it furnish joy?\nThat mortal weighs for nothing-worth with me,\nWhom Hope can comfort with her fruitless fire.\nHonour in life or honour in the grave\nBefits the noble heart. You hear my will.\nCH. From thine own spirit, Aias, all may tell,\nThat utterance came, and none have prompted thee.\nYet stay thy hurrying thought, and by thy friends\nBe ruled to loose this burden from thy mind.\nTEC. O my great master! heaviest of all woe\nIs theirs whose life is crushed beyond recall.\n[page 57][487-526]I, born of one the mightiest of the free\nAnd wealthiest in the Phrygian land, am now\nA captive. So Heaven willed, and thy strong arm\nDetermined. Therefore, since the hour that made\nMy being one with thine, I breathe for thee;\nAnd I beseech thee by the sacred fire\nOf home, and by the sweetness of the night\nWhen from thy captive I became thy bride,\nLeave me not guardless to the unworthy touch\nAnd cruel taunting of thine enemies’\nFor, shouldst thou die and leave us, then shall I\nBorne off by Argive violence with thy boy\nEat from that day the bread of slavery.\nAnd some one of our lords shall smite me there\nWith galling speech: Behold the concubine\nOf Aias, first of all the Greeks for might,\nHow envied once, worn with what service now!\nSo will they speak; and while my quailing heart\nShall sink beneath its burden, clouds of shame\nWill dim thy glory and degrade thy race.\nOh! think but of thy father, left to pine\nIn doleful age, and let thy mother’s grief—\nWho, long bowed down with many a careful year,\nPrays oftentimes thou may’st return alive—\nO’er awe thee. Yea, and pity thine own son,\nUnsheltered in his boyhood, lorn of thee,\nWith bitter foes to tend his orphanhood,\nThink, O my lord, what sorrow in thy death\nThou send’st on him and me. For I have nought\nTo lean to but thy life. My fatherland\nThy spear hath ruined. Fate—not thou—hath sent\nMy sire and mother to the home of death\nWhat wealth have I to comfort me for thee?\nWhat land of refuge? Thou art all my stay\nOh, of me too take thought! Shall men have joy,\nAnd not remember? Or shall kindness fade?\nSay, can the mind be noble, where the stream\nOf gratitude is withered from the spring?\nCH. Aias, I would thy heart were touched like mine\nWith pity; then her words would win thy praise.\n[page 58][527-565]AI. My praise she shall not miss, if she perform\nMy bidding with firm heart, and fail not here.\nTEC. Dear Aias, I will fail in nought thou bidst me.\nAI. Bring me my boy, that I may see his face.\nTEC. Oh, in my terror I conveyed him hence!\nAI. Clear of this mischief, mean’st thou? or for what?\nTEC. Lest he might run to thee, poor child, and die.\nAI. That issue had been worthy of my fate!\nTEC. But I kept watch to fence his life from harm.\nAI. ’Twas wisely done. I praise thy foresight there.\nTEC. Well, since ’tis so, how can I help thee now?\nAI. Give me to speak to him and see him near.\nTEC. He stands close by with servants tending him.\nAI. Then why doth he not come, but still delay?\nTEC. Thy father calls thee, child. Come, lead him hither,\nWhichever of you holds him by the hand.\nAI. Moves he? or do thine accents idly fall?\nTEC. See, where thy people bring him to thine eye.\nAI. Lift him to me: lift him! He will not fear\nAt sight of this fresh havoc of the sword,\nIf rightly he be fathered of my blood.\nLike some young colt he must be trained and taught\nTo run fierce courses with his warrior sire.\nBe luckier than thy father, boy! but else\nBe like him, and thy life will not be low.\nOne thing even now I envy thee, that none\nOf all this misery pierces to thy mind.\nFor life is sweetest in the void of sense,\nEre thou know joy or sorrow. But when this\nHath found thee, make thy father’s enemies\nFeel the great parent in the valiant child.\nMeantime grow on in tender youthfulness,\nNursed by light breezes, gladdening this thy mother.\nNo Greek shall trample thee with brutal harm,\nThat I know well, though I shall not be near—\nSo stout a warder to protect thy life\nI leave in Teucer. He’ll not fail, though now\nHe follow far the chase upon his foes.\nMy trusty warriors, people of the sea,\n[page 59][566-596]Be this your charge, no less,—and bear to him\nMy clear commandment, that he take this boy\nHome to my fatherland, and make him known\nTo Telamon, and Eriboea too,\nMy mother. Let him tend them in their age.\nAnd, for mine armour, let not that be made\nThe award of Grecian umpires or of him\nWho ruined me. But thou, named of the shield,\nEurysakes, hold mine, the unpierceable\nSeven-hided buckler, and by the well stitched thong\nGrasp firm and wield it mightily.—The rest\nShall lie where I am buried.—Take him now,\nQuickly, and close the door. No tears! What! weep\nBefore the tent? How women crave for pity!\nMake fast, I say. No wise physician dreams\nWith droning charms to salve a desperate sore.\nCH. There sounds a vehement ardour in thy words\nThat likes me not. I fear thy sharpened tongue.\nTEC. Aias, my lord, what act is in thy mind?\nAI. Inquire not, question not; be wise, thou’rt best.\nTEC. How my heart sinks! Oh, by thy child, by Heaven,\nI pray thee on my knees, forsake us not!\nAI. Thou troublest me. What! know’st thou not that Heaven\nHath ceased to be my debtor from to-day?\nTEC. Hush! Speak not so.\nAI. Speak thou to those that hear.\nTEC. Will you not hear me?\nAI. Canst thou not be still?\nTEC. My fears, my fears!\nAI. (to the Attendants). Come, shut me in, I say.\nTEC.

Friends, my first news is Teucer’s presence here,\nFresh from the Mysian heights; who, as he came\nRight toward the generals’ quarter, was assailed\nWith outcry from the Argives in a throng:\nFor when they knew his motion from afar\nThey swarmed around him, and with shouts of blame\nFrom each side one and all assaulted him\nAs brother to the man who had gone mad\nAnd plotted ’gainst the host,—threatening aloud,\nSpite of his strength, he should be stoned, and die.\n—So far strife ran, that swords unscabbarded\nCrossed blades, till as it mounted to the height\nAge interposed with counsel, and it fell.\nBut where is Aias to receive my word?\nTidings are best told to the rightful ear.\nCH. Not in the hut, but just gone forth, preparing\nNew plans to suit his newly altered mind.\nMESS. Alas!\nToo tardy then was he who sped me hither;\nOr I have proved too slow a messenger.\nCH. What point is lacking for thine errand’s speed?\nMESS. Teucer was resolute the man should bide\nClose held within-doors till himself should come.\nCH. Why, sure his going took the happiest turn\nAnd wisest, to propitiate Heaven’s high wrath.\nMESS. The height of folly lives in such discourse,\nIf Calchas have the wisdom of a seer.\nCH. What knowest thou of our state? What saith he? Tell.\nMESS. I can tell only what I heard and saw.\nWhilst all the chieftains and the Atridae twain\nWere seated in a ring, Calchas alone\nRose up and left them, and in Teucer’s palm\nLaid his right hand full friendly; then out-spake\nWith strict injunction by all means i’ the world\nTo keep beneath yon covert this one day\nYour hero, and not suffer him to rove,\n[page 64][755-789]If he would see him any more alive.\nFor through this present light—and ne’er again—-\nHoly Athena, so he said, will drive him\nBefore her anger. Such calamitous woe\nStrikes down the unprofitable growth that mounts\nBeyond his measure and provokes the sky.\n‘Thus ever,’ said the prophet, ‘must he fall\nWho in man’s mould hath thoughts beyond a man.\nAnd Aias, ere he left his father’s door,\nMade foolish answer to his prudent sire.\n‘My son,’ said Telamon, ‘choose victory\nAlways, but victory with an aid from Heaven.’\nHow loftily, how madly, he replied!\n‘Father, with heavenly help men nothing worth\nMay win success. But I am confident\nWithout the Gods to pluck this glory down.’\nSo huge the boast he vaunted! And again\nWhen holy Pallas urged him with her voice\nTo hurl his deadly spear against the foe,\nHe turned on her with speech of awful sound:\n‘Goddess, by other Greeks take thou thy stand;\nWhere I keep rank, the battle ne’er shall break.’\nSuch words of pride beyond the mortal scope\nHave won him Pallas’ wrath, unlovely meed.\nBut yet, perchance, so be it he live to-day,\nWe, with Heaven’s succour, may restore his peace.’—\nThus far the prophet, when immediately\nTeucer dispatched me, ere the assembly rose,\nBearing to thee this missive to be kept\nWith all thy care. But if my speed be lost,\nAnd Calchas’ word have power, the man is dead.\nCH.

Thy case I know not; but of Aias this,\nThat if he roam abroad, ’tis dangerous.\nTEC. He is, indeed, abroad.

Didst thou then perceive\nDead Hector was at length to be thine end?—\nI pray you all, consider these two men.\nHector, whose gift from Aias was a girdle,\nTight-braced therewith to the car’s rim, was dragged\nAnd scarified till he breathed forth his life.\nAnd Aias with this present from his foe\nFinds through such means his death-fall and his doom.\nSay then what cruel workman forged the gifts,\nBut Fury this sharp sword, Hell that bright band?\nIn this, and all things human, I maintain,\nGods are the artificers. My thought is said.\nAnd if there be who cares not for my thought,\nLet him hold fast his faith and leave me mine.\nCH. Spare longer speech, and think how to secure\nThy brother’s burial, and what plea will serve;\nSince one comes here hath no good will to us\nAnd like a villain haply comes in scorn.\nTEU. What man of all the host hath caught thine eye?\nCH. The cause for whom we sailed, the Spartan King.\nTEU. Yes; I discern him, now he moves more near.\n[page 72][1047-1083]\nEnter MENELAUS.\nMENELAUS. Fellow, give o’er. Cease tending yon dead man!\nObey my voice, and leave him where he lies.\nTEU. Thy potent cause for spending so much breath?\nMEN. My will, and his whose word is sovereign here.\nTEU. May we not know the reasons of your will?\nMEN. Because he, whom we trusted to have brought\nTo lend us loyal help with heart and hand,\nProved in the trial a worse than Phrygian foe;\nWho lay in wait for all the host by night,\nAnd sallied forth in arms to shed our blood;\nThat, had not one in Heaven foiled this attempt,\nOur lot had been to lie as he doth here\nDead and undone for ever, while he lived\nAnd flourished. Heaven hath turned this turbulence\nTo fall instead upon the harmless flock.\nWherefore no strength of man shall once avail\nTo encase his body with a seemly tomb,\nBut outcast on the wide and watery sand,\nHe’ll feed the birds that batten on the shore.\nNor let thy towering spirit therefore rise\nIn threatening wrath. Wilt thou or not, our hand\nShall rule him dead, howe’er he braved us living,\nAnd that by force; for never would he yield,\nEven while he lived, to words from me. And yet\nIt shows base metal when the subject-wight\nDeigns not to hearken to the chief in power.\nSince without settled awe, neither in states\nCan laws have rightful sway, nor can a host\nBe governed with due wisdom, if no fear\nOr wholesome shame be there to shield its safety.\nAnd though a man wax great in thews and bulk,\nLet him be warned: a trifling harm may ruin him.\nWhoever knows respect and honour both\nStands free from risk of dark vicissitude.\nBut whereso pride and licence have their fling,\nBe sure that state will one day lose her course\nAnd founder in the abysm. Let fear have place\n[page 73][1084-1122]Still where it ought, say I, nor let men think\nTo do their pleasure and not bide the pain.\nThat wheel comes surely round. Once Aias flamed\nWith insolent fierceness. Now I mount in pride,\nAnd loudly bid thee bury him not, lest burying\nThy brother thou be burrowing thine own grave.\nCH. Menelaüs, make not thy philosophy\nA platform whence to insult the valiant dead.\nTEU. I nevermore will marvel, sirs, when one\nOf humblest parentage is prone to sin,\nSince those reputed men of noble strain\nStoop to such phrase of prating frowardness.\nCome, tell it o’er again,—said you ye brought\nMy brother bound to aid you with his power?\nSailed he not forth of his own sovereign will?\nWhere is thy voucher of command o’er him?\nWhere of thy right o’er those that followed him?\nSparta, not we, shall buckle to thy sway.\n’Twas written nowhere in the bond of rule\nThat thou shouldst check him rather than he thee.\nThou sailedst under orders, not in charge\nOf all, much less of Aias. Then pursue\nThy limited direction, and chastise,\nIn haughty phrase, the men who fear thy nod.\nBut I will bury Aias, whether thou\nOr the other general give consent or no.\n’Tis not for me to tremble at your word.\nNot to reclaim thy wife, like those poor souls\nThou flll’st with labour, issued this man forth,\nBut caring for his oath, and not for thee,\nOr any other nobody. Then come\nWith heralds all arow, and bring the man\nCalled king of men with thee! For thy sole noise\nI budge not, wert thou twenty times thy name.\nCH. The sufferer should not bear a bitter tongue.\nHard words, how just soe’er, will leave their sting.\nMEN. Our bowman carries no small pride, I see.\nTEU. No mere mechanic’s menial craft is mine.\nMEN. How wouldst thou vaunt it hadst thou but a shield!\n[page 74][1123-1158]TEU. Unarmed I fear not thee in panoply.\nMEN. Redoubted is the wrath lives on thy tongue.\nTEU. Whose cause is just hath licence to be proud.\nMEN. Just, that my murderer have a peaceful end?\nTEU. Thy murderer? Strange, to have been slain and live!\nMEN. Yea, through Heaven’s mercy. By his will, I am dead.\nTEU. If Heaven have saved thee, give the Gods their due.\nMEN. Am I the man to spurn at Heaven’s command?\nTEU. Thou dost, to come and frustrate burial.\nMEN. Honour forbids to yield my foe a tomb.\nTEU. And Aias was thy foeman? Where and when?\nMEN. Hate lived between us; that thou know’st full well.\nTEU. For thy proved knavery, coining votes i’ the court\nMEN. The judges voted. He ne’er lost through me.\nTEU. Guilt hiding guile wears often fairest front.\nMEN. I know whom pain shall harass for that word.\nTEU. Not without giving equal pain, ’tis clear.\nMEN. No more, but this. No burial for this man!\nTEU. Yea, this much more. He shall have instant burial.\nMEN. I have seen ere now a man of doughty tongue\nUrge sailors in foul weather to unmoor,\nWho, caught in the sea-misery by and by,\nLay voiceless, muffled in his cloak, and suffered\nWho would of the sailors over trample him\nEven so methinks thy truculent mouth ere long\nShall quench its outcry, when this little cloud\nBreaks forth on thee with the full tempest’s might.\nTEU. I too have seen a man whose windy pride\nPoured forth loud insults o’er a neighbour’s fall,\nTill one whose cause and temper showed like mine\nSpake to him in my hearing this plain word:\n‘Man, do the dead no wrong; but, if thou dost,\nBe sure thou shalt have sorrow.’ Thus he warned\nThe infatuate one: ay, one whom I behold,\n[page 75][1158-1185]For all may read my riddle—thou art he.\nMEN. I will be gone. ’Twere shame to me, if known,\nTo chide when I have power to crush by force.\nTEU.

Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nAntigone, daughter of Oedipus, the late king of Thebes, in defiance of Creon who rules in his stead, resolves to bury her brother Polyneices, slain in his attack on Thebes. She is caught in the act by Creon’s watchmen and brought before the king. She justifies her action, asserting that she was bound to obey the eternal laws of right and wrong in spite of any human ordinance. Creon, unrelenting, condemns her to be immured in a rock-hewn chamber. His son Haemon, to whom Antigone is betrothed, pleads in vain for her life and threatens to die with her. Warned by the seer Teiresias Creon repents him and hurries to release Antigone from her rocky prison. But he is too late: he finds lying side by side Antigone who had hanged herself and Haemon who also has perished by his own hand. Returning to the palace he sees within the dead body of his queen who on learning of her son’s death has stabbed herself to the heart.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE—daughters of Oedipus and sisters of Polyneices and Eteocles.\nCREON, King of Thebes.\nHAEMON, Son of Creon, betrothed to Antigone.\nEURYDICE, wife of Creon.\nTEIRESIAS, the prophet.\nCHORUS, of Theban elders.\nA WATCHMAN\nA MESSENGER\nA SECOND MESSENGER\nANTIGONE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE before the Palace gates.\nANTIGONE.\nIsmene, sister of my blood and heart,\nSee’st thou how Zeus would in our lives fulfill\nThe weird of Oedipus, a world of woes!\nFor what of pain, affliction, outrage, shame,\nIs lacking in our fortunes, thine and mine?\nAnd now this proclamation of today\nMade by our Captain-General to the State,\nWhat can its purport be? Didst hear and heed,\nOr art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?\nISMENE.\nTo me, Antigone, no word of friends\nHas come, or glad or grievous, since we twain\nWere reft of our two brethren in one day\nBy double fratricide; and since i’ the night\nOur Argive leaguers fled, no later news\nHas reached me, to inspirit or deject.\nANTIGONE.\nI know ’twas so, and therefore summoned thee\nBeyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.\nISMENE.\nWhat is it? Some dark secret stirs thy breast.\nANTIGONE.\nWhat but the thought of our two brothers dead,\nThe one by Creon graced with funeral rites,\nThe other disappointed?

I perforce obey\nThe powers that be. ’Tis foolishness, I ween,\nTo overstep in aught the golden mean.\nANTIGONE.\nI urge no more; nay, wert thou willing still,\nI would not welcome such a fellowship.\nGo thine own way; myself will bury him.\nHow sweet to die in such employ, to rest,—\nSister and brother linked in love’s embrace—\nA sinless sinner, banned awhile on earth,\nBut by the dead commended; and with them\nI shall abide for ever.

For myself, I call\nTo witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,\nIf I perceive some mischievous design\nTo sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;\nNor would I reckon as my private friend\nA public foe, well knowing that the State\nIs the good ship that holds our fortunes all:\nFarewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.\nSuch is the policy by which I seek\nTo serve the Commons and conformably\nI have proclaimed an edict as concerns\nThe sons of Oedipus; Eteocles\nWho in his country’s battle fought and fell,\nThe foremost champion—duly bury him\nWith all observances and ceremonies\nThat are the guerdon of the heroic dead.\nBut for the miscreant exile who returned\nMinded in flames and ashes to blot out\nHis father’s city and his father’s gods,\nAnd glut his vengeance with his kinsmen’s blood,\nOr drag them captive at his chariot wheels—\nFor Polyneices ’tis ordained that none\nShall give him burial or make mourn for him,\nBut leave his corpse unburied, to be meat\nFor dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.\nSo am I purposed; never by my will\nShall miscreants take precedence of true men,\nBut all good patriots, alive or dead,\nShall be by me preferred and honored.\nCHORUS.\nSon of Menoeceus, thus thou will’st to deal\nWith him who loathed and him who loved our State.\nThy word is law; thou canst dispose of us\nThe living, as thou will’st, as of the dead.\nCREON.\nSee then ye execute what I ordain.\nCHORUS.\nOn younger shoulders lay this grievous charge.\nCREON.\nFear not, I’ve posted guards to watch the corpse.\nCHORUS.\nWhat further duty would’st thou lay on us?\nCREON.\nNot to connive at disobedience.\nCHORUS.\nNo man is mad enough to court his death.\nCREON.\nThe penalty is death: yet hope of gain\nHath lured men to their ruin oftentimes.\n[Enter GUARD]\nGUARD.\nMy lord, I will not make pretense to pant\nAnd puff as some light-footed messenger.\nIn sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought\nMade many a halt and turned and turned again;\nFor conscience plied her spur and curb by turns.\n“Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?”\nShe whispered. Then again, “If Creon learn\nThis from another, thou wilt rue it worse.”\nThus leisurely I hastened on my road;\nMuch thought extends a furlong to a league.\nBut in the end the forward voice prevailed,\nTo face thee. I will speak though I say nothing.\nFor plucking courage from despair methought,\n‘Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.’\nCREON.\nWhat is thy news? Why this despondency?\nGUARD.\nLet me premise a word about myself?\nI neither did the deed nor saw it done,\nNor were it just that I should come to harm.\nCREON.\nThou art good at parry, and canst fence about\nSome matter of grave import, as is plain.\nGUARD.\nThe bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.\nCREON.\nThen, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.\nGUARD.\nWell, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone\nE’en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,\nPerformed the proper ritual—and was gone.\nCREON.\nWhat say’st thou? Who hath dared to do this thing?\nGUARD.\nI cannot tell, for there was ne’er a trace\nOf pick or mattock—hard unbroken ground,\nWithout a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,\nNo sign that human hands had been at work.\nWhen the first sentry of the morning watch\nGave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.\nThe corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,\nBut strewn with dust, as if by one who sought\nTo avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:\nOf hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.\nThereat arose an angry war of words;\nGuard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,\nFor none was there to part us, each in turn\nSuspected, but the guilt brought home to none,\nFrom lack of evidence. We challenged each\nThe ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,\nOr pass through fire, affirming on our oath\nOur innocence—we neither did the deed\nOurselves, nor know who did or compassed it.\nOur quest was at a standstill, when one spake\nAnd bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,\nFor there was no gainsaying him nor way\nTo escape perdition: Yeareboundtotell\nTheKing,yecannothideit; so he spake.\nAnd he convinced us all; so lots were cast,\nAnd I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.\nSo here I am unwilling and withal\nUnwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.\nCHORUS.\nI had misgivings from the first, my liege,\nOf something more than natural at work.\nCREON.\nO cease, you vex me with your babblement;\nI am like to think you dote in your old age.\nIs it not arrant folly to pretend\nThat gods would have a thought for this dead man?\nDid they forsooth award him special grace,\nAnd as some benefactor bury him,\nWho came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,\nTo sack their shrines, to desolate their land,\nAnd scout their ordinances? Or perchance\nThe gods bestow their favors on the bad.\nNo! no! I have long noted malcontents\nWho wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,\nMisliking these my orders, and my rule.\n’Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards\nBy bribes. Of evils current upon earth\nThe worst is money. Money ’tis that sacks\nCities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;\nWarps and seduces native innocence,\nAnd breeds a habit of dishonesty.\nBut they who sold themselves shall find their greed\nOut-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.\nYea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,\nBy Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring\nBefore my presence here the very man\nWho carried out this lawless burial,\nDeath for your punishment shall not suffice.\nHanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make\nConfession of this outrage. This will teach you\nWhat practices are like to serve your turn.\nThere are some villainies that bring no gain.\nFor by dishonesty the few may thrive,\nThe many come to ruin and disgrace.\nGUARD.\nMay I not speak, or must I turn and go\nWithout a word?—\nCREON.\nBegone! canst thou not see\nThat e’en this question irks me?\nGUARD.\nWhere, my lord?\nIs it thy ears that suffer, or thy heart?\nCREON.\nWhy seek to probe and find the seat of pain?\nGUARD.\nI gall thine ears—this miscreant thy mind.\nCREON.\nWhat an inveterate babbler! get thee gone!\nGUARD.\nBabbler perchance, but innocent of the crime.\nCREON.\nTwice guilty, having sold thy soul for gain.\nGUARD.\nAlas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.\nCREON.\nGo, quibble with thy reason. If thou fail’st\nTo find these malefactors, thou shalt own\nThe wages of ill-gotten gains is death.\n[Exit CREON]\nGUARD.\nI pray he may be found. But caught or not\n(And fortune must determine that) thou never\nShalt see me here returning; that is sure.\nFor past all hope or thought I have escaped,\nAnd for my safety owe the gods much thanks.\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nMany wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;\nOver the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,\nThrough the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;\nAnd the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay\nEver he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,\nWith breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.\n(Ant. 1)\nThe light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood\nHe traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.\nMaster of cunning he: the savage bull, and the hart\nWho roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;\nAnd the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.\n(Str. 2)\nSpeech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,\nHe hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly\nAnd the nipping airs that freeze, ’neath the open winter sky.\nHe hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;\nSafe whate’er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.\n(Ant. 2)\nPassing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,\nThat guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.\nIf he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State\nProudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate\nWhoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;\nNe’er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.\nWhat strange vision meets my eyes,\nFills me with a wild surprise?\nSure I know her, sure ’tis she,\nThe maid Antigone.\nHapless child of hapless sire,\nDidst thou recklessly conspire,\nMadly brave the King’s decree?\nTherefore are they haling thee?\n[Enter GUARD bringing ANTIGONE]\nGUARD.\nHere is the culprit taken in the act\nOf giving burial. But where’s the King?\nCHORUS.\nThere from the palace he returns in time.\n[Enter CREON]\nCREON.\nWhy is my presence timely? What has chanced?\nGUARD.\nNo man, my lord, should make a vow, for if\nHe ever swears he will not do a thing,\nHis afterthoughts belie his first resolve.\nWhen from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled\nI sware thou wouldst not see me here again;\nBut the wild rapture of a glad surprise\nIntoxicates, and so I’m here forsworn.\nAnd here’s my prisoner, caught in the very act,\nDecking the grave. No lottery this time;\nThis prize is mine by right of treasure-trove.\nSo take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.\nShe’s thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim\nHence to depart well quit of all these ills.\nCREON.\nSay, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?\nGUARD.\nBurying the man. There’s nothing more to tell.\nCREON.\nHast thou thy wits? Or know’st thou what thou say’st?\nGUARD.\nI saw this woman burying the corpse\nAgainst thy orders. Is that clear and plain?\nCREON.\nBut how was she surprised and caught in the act?\nGUARD.\nIt happened thus. No sooner had we come,\nDriven from thy presence by those awful threats,\nThan straight we swept away all trace of dust,\nAnd bared the clammy body. Then we sat\nHigh on the ridge to windward of the stench,\nWhile each man kept he fellow alert and rated\nRoundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.\nSo all night long we watched, until the sun\nStood high in heaven, and his blazing beams\nSmote us. A sudden whirlwind then upraised\nA cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,\nAnd swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,\nAnd shook the firmament. We closed our eyes\nAnd waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.\nAt last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.\nA piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,\nAs when the mother bird beholds her nest\nRobbed of its nestlings; even so the maid\nWailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,\nAnd cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.\nAnon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,\nThen, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,\nThrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.\nWe at the sight swooped down on her and seized\nOur quarry. Undismayed she stood, and when\nWe taxed her with the former crime and this,\nShe disowned nothing. I was glad—and grieved;\nFor ’tis most sweet to ’scape oneself scot-free,\nAnd yet to bring disaster to a friend\nIs grievous. Take it all in all, I deem\nA man’s first duty is to serve himself.\nCREON.\nSpeak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,\nDoes thou plead guilty or deny the deed?\nANTIGONE.\nGuilty. I did it, I deny it not.\nCREON (to GUARD)\nSirrah, begone whither thou wilt, and thank\nThy luck that thou hast ’scaped a heavy charge.\n(To ANTIGONE)\nNow answer this plain question, yes or no,\nWast thou acquainted with the interdict?\nANTIGONE.\nI knew, all knew; how should I fail to know?\nCREON.\nAnd yet wert bold enough to break the law?\nANTIGONE.\nYea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus,\nAnd she who sits enthroned with gods below,\nJustice, enacted not these human laws.\nNor did I deem that thou, a mortal man,\nCould’st by a breath annul and override\nThe immutable unwritten laws of Heaven.\nThey were not born today nor yesterday;\nThey die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang.\nI was not like, who feared no mortal’s frown,\nTo disobey these laws and so provoke\nThe wrath of Heaven. I knew that I must die,\nE’en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death\nIs thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.\nFor death is gain to him whose life, like mine,\nIs full of misery. Thus my lot appears\nNot sad, but blissful; for had I endured\nTo leave my mother’s son unburied there,\nI should have grieved with reason, but not now.\nAnd if in this thou judgest me a fool,\nMethinks the judge of folly’s not acquit.\nCHORUS.\nA stubborn daughter of a stubborn sire,\nThis ill-starred maiden kicks against the pricks.\nCREON.\nWell, let her know the stubbornest of wills\nAre soonest bended, as the hardest iron,\nO’er-heated in the fire to brittleness,\nFlies soonest into fragments, shivered through.\nA snaffle curbs the fieriest steed, and he\nWho in subjection lives must needs be meek.\nBut this proud girl, in insolence well-schooled,\nFirst overstepped the established law, and then—\nA second and worse act of insolence—\nShe boasts and glories in her wickedness.\nNow if she thus can flout authority\nUnpunished, I am woman, she the man.\nBut though she be my sister’s child or nearer\nOf kin than all who worship at my hearth,\nNor she nor yet her sister shall escape\nThe utmost penalty, for both I hold,\nAs arch-conspirators, of equal guilt.\nBring forth the older; even now I saw her\nWithin the palace, frenzied and distraught.\nThe workings of the mind discover oft\nDark deeds in darkness schemed, before the act.\nMore hateful still the miscreant who seeks\nWhen caught, to make a virtue of a crime.\nANTIGONE.\nWould’st thou do more than slay thy prisoner?\nCREON.\nNot I, thy life is mine, and that’s enough.\nANTIGONE.\nWhy dally then? To me no word of thine\nIs pleasant: God forbid it e’er should please;\nNor am I more acceptable to thee.\nAnd yet how otherwise had I achieved\nA name so glorious as by burying\nA brother? so my townsmen all would say,\nWhere they not gagged by terror, Manifold\nA king’s prerogatives, and not the least\nThat all his acts and all his words are law.\nCREON.\nOf all these Thebans none so deems but thou.\nANTIGONE.\nThese think as I, but bate their breath to thee.\nCREON.\nHast thou no shame to differ from all these?\nANTIGONE.\nTo reverence kith and kin can bring no shame.\nCREON.\nWas his dead foeman not thy kinsman too?\nANTIGONE.\nOne mother bare them and the self-same sire.\nCREON.\nWhy cast a slur on one by honoring one?\nANTIGONE.\nThe dead man will not bear thee out in this.\nCREON.\nSurely, if good and evil fare alive.\nANTIGONE.\nThe slain man was no villain but a brother.\nCREON.\nThe patriot perished by the outlaw’s brand.\nANTIGONE.\nNathless the realms below these rites require.\nCREON.\nNot that the base should fare as do the brave.\nANTIGONE.\nWho knows if this world’s crimes are virtues there?\nCREON.\nNot even death can make a foe a friend.\nANTIGONE.\nMy nature is for mutual love, not hate.\nCREON.\nDie then, and love the dead if thou must;\nNo woman shall be the master while I live.\n[Enter ISMENE]\nCHORUS.\nLo from out the palace gate,\nWeeping o’er her sister’s fate,\nComes Ismene; see her brow,\nOnce serene, beclouded now,\nSee her beauteous face o’erspread\nWith a flush of angry red.\nCREON.\nWoman, who like a viper unperceived\nDidst harbor in my house and drain my blood,\nTwo plagues I nurtured blindly, so it proved,\nTo sap my throne. Say, didst thou too abet\nThis crime, or dost abjure all privity?\nISMENE.\nI did the deed, if she will have it so,\nAnd with my sister claim to share the guilt.\nANTIGONE.\nThat were unjust. Thou would’st not act with me\nAt first, and I refused thy partnership.\nISMENE.\nBut now thy bark is stranded, I am bold\nTo claim my share as partner in the loss.\nANTIGONE.\nWho did the deed the under-world knows well:\nA friend in word is never friend of mine.\nISMENE.\nO sister, scorn me not, let me but share\nThy work of piety, and with thee die.\nANTIGONE.\nClaim not a work in which thou hadst no hand;\nOne death sufficeth.

Find’st thou pleasure in these gibes?\nANTIGONE.\n’Tis a sad mockery, if indeed I mock.\nISMENE.\nO say if I can help thee even now.\nANTIGONE.\nNo, save thyself; I grudge not thy escape.\nISMENE.\nIs e’en this boon denied, to share thy lot?\nANTIGONE.\nYea, for thou chosed’st life, and I to die.\nISMENE.\nThou canst not say that I did not protest.\nANTIGONE.\nWell, some approved thy wisdom, others mine.\nISMENE.\nBut now we stand convicted, both alike.\nANTIGONE.\nFear not; thou livest, I died long ago\nThen when I gave my life to save the dead.\nCREON.\nBoth maids, methinks, are crazed. One suddenly\nHas lost her wits, the other was born mad.\nISMENE.\nYea, so it falls, sire, when misfortune comes,\nThe wisest even lose their mother wit.\nCREON.\nI’ faith thy wit forsook thee when thou mad’st\nThy choice with evil-doers to do ill.\nISMENE.\nWhat life for me without my sister here?\nCREON.\nSay not thy sister here: thy sister’s dead.\nISMENE.\nWhat, wilt thou slay thy own son’s plighted bride?\nCREON.\nAye, let him raise him seed from other fields.\nISMENE.\nNo new espousal can be like the old.\nCREON.\nA plague on trulls who court and woo our sons.\nANTIGONE.\nO Haemon, how thy sire dishonors thee!\nCREON.\nA plague on thee and thy accursed bride!\nCHORUS.\nWhat, wilt thou rob thine own son of his bride?\nCREON.\n’Tis death that bars this marriage, not his sire.\nCHORUS.\nSo her death-warrant, it would seem, is sealed.\nCREON.\nBy you, as first by me; off with them, guards,\nAnd keep them close. Henceforward let them learn\nTo live as women use, not roam at large.\nFor e’en the bravest spirits run away\nWhen they perceive death pressing on life’s heels.\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nThrice blest are they who never tasted pain!\nIf once the curse of Heaven attaint a race,\nThe infection lingers on and speeds apace,\nAge after age, and each the cup must drain.\nSo when Etesian blasts from Thrace downpour\nSweep o’er the blackening main and whirl to land\nFrom Ocean’s cavernous depths his ooze and sand,\nBillow on billow thunders on the shore.\n(Ant. 1)\nOn the Labdacidae I see descending\nWoe upon woe; from days of old some god\nLaid on the race a malison, and his rod\nScourges each age with sorrows never ending.\nThe light that dawned upon its last born son\nIs vanished, and the bloody axe of Fate\nHas felled the goodly tree that blossomed late.\nO Oedipus, by reckless pride undone!\n(Str. 2)\nThy might, O Zeus, what mortal power can quell?\nNot sleep that lays all else beneath its spell,\nNor moons that never tire: untouched by Time,\nThroned in the dazzling light\nThat crowns Olympus’ height,\nThou reignest King, omnipotent, sublime.\nPast, present, and to be,\nAll bow to thy decree,\nAll that exceeds the mean by Fate\nIs punished, Love or Hate.\n(Ant. 2)\nHope flits about never-wearying wings;\nProfit to some, to some light loves she brings,\nBut no man knoweth how her gifts may turn,\nTill ’neath his feet the treacherous ashes burn.\nSure ’twas a sage inspired that spake this word;\nIf evil good appear\nTo any, Fate is near;\nAnd brief the respite from her flaming sword.\nHither comes in angry mood\nHaemon, latest of thy brood;\nIs it for his bride he’s grieved,\nOr her marriage-bed deceived,\nDoth he make his mourn for thee,\nMaid forlorn, Antigone?\n[Enter HAEMON]\nCREON.\nSoon shall we know, better than seer can tell.\nLearning may fixed decree anent thy bride,\nThou mean’st not, son, to rave against thy sire?\nKnow’st not whate’er we do is done in love?\nHAEMON.\nO father, I am thine, and I will take\nThy wisdom as the helm to steer withal.\nTherefore no wedlock shall by me be held\nMore precious than thy loving goverance.\nCREON.\nWell spoken: so right-minded sons should feel,\nIn all deferring to a father’s will.\nFor ’tis the hope of parents they may rear\nA brood of sons submissive, keen to avenge\nTheir father’s wrongs, and count his friends their own.\nBut who begets unprofitable sons,\nHe verily breeds trouble for himself,\nAnd for his foes much laughter.

But repeat your tale\nTo one not unacquaint with misery.\nMESSENGER.\nDear mistress, I was there and will relate\nThe perfect truth, omitting not one word.\nWhy should we gloze and flatter, to be proved\nLiars hereafter? Truth is ever best.\nWell, in attendance on my liege, your lord,\nI crossed the plain to its utmost margin, where\nThe corse of Polyneices, gnawn and mauled,\nWas lying yet. We offered first a prayer\nTo Pluto and the goddess of cross-ways,\nWith contrite hearts, to deprecate their ire.\nThen laved with lustral waves the mangled corse,\nLaid it on fresh-lopped branches, lit a pyre,\nAnd to his memory piled a mighty mound\nOf mother earth. Then to the caverned rock,\nThe bridal chamber of the maid and Death,\nWe sped, about to enter. But a guard\nHeard from that godless shrine a far shrill wail,\nAnd ran back to our lord to tell the news.\nBut as he nearer drew a hollow sound\nOf lamentation to the King was borne.\nHe groaned and uttered then this bitter plaint:\n“Am I a prophet? miserable me!\nIs this the saddest path I ever trod?\n’Tis my son’s voice that calls me. On press on,\nMy henchmen, haste with double speed to the tomb\nWhere rocks down-torn have made a gap, look in\nAnd tell me if in truth I recognize\nThe voice of Haemon or am heaven-deceived.”\nSo at the bidding of our distraught lord\nWe looked, and in the craven’s vaulted gloom\nI saw the maiden lying strangled there,\nA noose of linen twined about her neck;\nAnd hard beside her, clasping her cold form,\nHer lover lay bewailing his dead bride\nDeath-wedded, and his father’s cruelty.\nWhen the King saw him, with a terrible groan\nHe moved towards him, crying, “O my son\nWhat hast thou done? What ailed thee? What mischance\nHas reft thee of thy reason? O come forth,\nCome forth, my son; thy father supplicates.”\nBut the son glared at him with tiger eyes,\nSpat in his face, and then, without a word,\nDrew his two-hilted sword and smote, but missed\nHis father flying backwards. Then the boy,\nWroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent\nFell on his sword and drove it through his side\nHome, but yet breathing clasped in his lax arms\nThe maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined\nWith his expiring gasps. So there they lay\nTwo corpses, one in death. His marriage rites\nAre consummated in the halls of Death:\nA witness that of ills whate’er befall\nMortals’ unwisdom is the worst of all.\n[Exit EURYDICE]\nCHORUS.\nWhat makest thou of this? The Queen has gone\nWithout a word importing good or ill.\nMESSENGER.\nI marvel too, but entertain good hope.\n’Tis that she shrinks in public to lament\nHer son’s sad ending, and in privacy\nWould with her maidens mourn a private loss.\nTrust me, she is discreet and will not err.\nCHORUS.\nI know not, but strained silence, so I deem,\nIs no less ominous than excessive grief.\nMESSENGER.\nWell, let us to the house and solve our doubts,\nWhether the tumult of her heart conceals\nSome fell design. It may be thou art right:\nUnnatural silence signifies no good.\nCHORUS.\nLo! the King himself appears.\nEvidence he with him bears\n’Gainst himself (ah me! I quake\n’Gainst a king such charge to make)\nBut all must own,\nThe guilt is his and his alone.\nCREON.\n(Str. 1)\nWoe for sin of minds perverse,\nDeadly fraught with mortal curse.\nBehold us slain and slayers, all akin.\nWoe for my counsel dire, conceived in sin.\nAlas, my son,\nLife scarce begun,\nThou wast undone.\nThe fault was mine, mine only, O my son!\nCHORUS.\nToo late thou seemest to perceive the truth.\nCREON.\n(Str. 2)\nBy sorrow schooled.

Orestes, then a child, had been rescued by his sister Electra, and sent into Phocis with the one servant who remained faithful to his old master. The son of Agamemnon now returns, being of a full age, accompanied by this same attendant and his friend Pylades, with whom he has already concerted a plan for taking vengeance on his father’s murderers, in obedience to the command of Apollo.\nOrestes had been received in Phocis by Strophius, his father’s friend.

Now all in a confusèd throng\nSpared not the goad, each eager to outgo\nThe crowded axles and the snorting steeds;\nFor close about his nimbly circling wheels\nAnd stooping sides fell flakes of panted foam.\nOrestes, ever nearest at the turn,\nWith whirling axle seemed to graze the stone,\nAnd loosing with free rein the right-hand steed\nThat pulled the side-rope, held the near one in.\nSo for a time all chariots upright moved,\nBut soon the Oetaean’s hard-mouthed horses broke\nFrom all control, and wheeling as they passed\nFrom the sixth circuit to begin the seventh,\nSmote front to front against the Barcan car.\n[page 151][728-766]And when that one disaster had befallen,\nEach dashed against his neighbour and was thrown,\nTill the whole plain was strewn with chariot-wreck.\nThen the Athenian, skilled to ply the rein,\nDrew on one side, and heaving to, let pass\nThe rider-crested surge that rolled i’ the midst.\nMeanwhile Orestes, trusting to the end,\nWas driving hindmost with tight rein; but now,\nSeeing him left the sole competitor,\nHurling fierce clamour through his steeds, pursued:\nSo drave they yoke by yoke—now this, now that\nPulling ahead with car and team. Orestes,\nIll-fated one, each previous course had driven\nSafely without a check, but after this,\nIn letting loose again the left-hand rein,\nHe struck the edge of the stone before he knew,\nShattering the axle’s end, and tumbled prone,\nCaught in the reins, that dragged him with sharp thongs.\nThen as he fell to the earth the horses swerved,\nAnd roamed the field. The people when they saw\nHim fallen from out the car, lamented loud\nFor the fair youth, who had achieved before them\nSuch glorious feats, and now had found such woe,—\nDashed on the ground, then tossed with legs aloft\nAgainst the sky,—until the charioteers,\nHardly restraining the impetuous team,\nReleased him, covered so with blood that none,—\nNo friend who saw—had known his hapless form.\nWhich then we duly burned upon the pyre.\nAnd straightway men appointed to the task\nFrom all the Phocians bear his mighty frame—\nPoor ashes! narrowed in a brazen urn,—\nThat he may find in his own fatherland\nHis share of sepulture.—Such our report,\nPainful to hear, but unto us, who saw,\nThe mightiest horror that e’er met mine eye.\nCH. Alas! the stock of our old masters, then,\nIs utterly uprooted and destroyed.\nCLY. O heavens! what shall I say? That this is well?\n[page 152][767-799]Or terrible, but gainful?

O misery! ’Tis time to wail thy fate,\nOrestes, when, in thy calamity,\nThy mother thus insults thee. Is it well?\nCLY. ’Tis well that he is gone, not that you live.\nEL. Hear, ’venging spirits of the lately dead!\nCLY. The avenging spirits have heard and answered well.\nEL. Insult us now, for thou art fortunate!\nCLY. You and Orestes are to quench my pride.\nEL. Our pride is quenched. No hope of quenching thee!\nCLY. A world of good is in thy coming, stranger,\nSince thou hast silenced this all-clamorous tongue.\nOLD M. Then I may go my way, seeing all is well.\n[page 153][800-836]CLY. Nay, go not yet!

Art thou mad, unhappy one, to laugh\nOver thine own calamity and mine?\nCHR. No, by our father’s hearth, I say not this\nIn mockery. I tell you he is come.\nEL. Me miserable! Who hath given thine ear\nThe word that so hath wrought on thy belief?\nCHR. Myself am the eyewitness, no one else\nGained my belief, but proofs I clearly saw.\nEL. What sign hath so engrossed thine eye, poor girl?\nWhat sight hath fired thee with this quenchless glow?\nCHR. But list to me, I pray thee, that henceforth\nThou mayest account me clear eyed, or a fool!\nEL. By all means, if it pleasure thee, say on.\nCHR. Well, I will tell thee all I saw:—I came\nUnto the ancient tomb that holds our sire;\nAnd from the topmost mound I marked a stream\nOf milk fresh-flowing, and his resting place\nRinged round with garlands of all flowers that blow.\nI marvelled at the sight, and peered about,\nLest some one might be nearer than we knew.\nBut finding all was quiet in the spot,\nI ventured closer to the tomb, and there,\nHard by the limit, I beheld a curl\nOf hair new shorn, with all the gloss of youth\nAnd straight it struck my heart, as with a sense\nOf something seen, ah me! long, long ago,\nAnd told me that my sight encountered here\nThe token of Orestes, dearest soul\nThen, clasping it, I did not cry aloud,\nBut straight mine eyes were filled with tears of joy.\n[page 156][907-943]And now as much as then I feel assured\nHe and none else bestowed this ornament.\nTo whom beyond thyself and me belongs\nSuch consecration? And I know this well,\nI did it not,—nor thou. Impossible!\nThou canst not worship even the blessèd Gods\nForth of this roof, unpunished. And, most sure,\nOur mother is not minded so to act,\nNor, had she done it, could we fail to know.\nThis offering comes then of Orestes’ hand.\nTake courage, dear one. Not one fate pursues\nOne house perpetually, but changeth still.\nOurs was a sullen Genius, but perchance\nThis day begins the assurance of much good.\nEL. Oh how I pity thine infatuate mind!\nCHR. Why? Dost thou find no comfort in my news?\nEL. You know not where you roam. Far wide! far wide!\nCHR. Not know? when I have seen it with mine eyes?\nEL. Dear, he is dead. Look not to him, poor girl!\nSalvation comes to thee no more from him.\nCHR. Oh me, unfortunate! Who told thee this?\nEL. He who stood by and saw his life destroyed.\nCHR. Amazement seizes me. Where is that man?\nEL. Right welcome to the mother there within.\nCHR. Me miserable! Who then can have decked\nWith all those ceremonies our father’s tomb?\nEL. I cannot but suppose some hand hath brought\nThese gifts in memory of Orestes dead.\nCHR. O cruel fate! While I in ecstasy\nSped with such news, all ignorant, it seems,\nOf our dire fortune; and, arriving, find\nFresh sorrows added to the former woe.\nEL. It is so, sister; yet if thou wilt list\nTo me, thou mayest disperse this heaviness.\nCHR. What? Shall I raise the dead again to life?\nEL. I did not mean so. I am not so fond.\nCHR. What bid you then that I have power to do?\nEL. To endure courageously what I enjoin.\n[page 157][944-981]CHR. So it make profit, I will not refuse.\nEL. Remember, without toil no plan may thrive!\nCHR. I know it, and will aid thee to my power.\nEL. Then hearken my resolve. Thou seëst now,\nWe have no friendly succour in the world;\nBut death has taken all, and we are left\nTwo only. I, so long as I could hear\nMy brother lived and flourished, still had hope\nHe would arise to wreak his father’s blood.\nBut now that he is gone, to thee I turn,\nTo help thy sister boldly to destroy\nThe guilty author of our father’s death,\nAegisthus.—Wherefore hide it from thee now?\n—Yea, sister! Till what term wilt thou remain\nInactive? To what end? What hope is yet\nLeft standing? Surely thou hast cause to grieve,\nBobbed of thy father’s opulent heritage,\nAnd feeling bitterly the creeping years\nThat find thee still a virgin and unwed.\nNay, nor imagine thou shalt ever know\nThat blessing. Not so careless of his life\nIs King Aegisthus, as to risk the birth\nOf sons from us, to his most certain fall.\nBut if thou wilt but follow my resolve,\nFirst thou shalt win renown of piety\nFrom our dead father, and our brother too,\nWho rest beneath the ground, and shalt be free\nFor evermore in station as in birth,\nAnd nobly matched in marriage, for the good\nDraw gazers to them still. Then seest thou not\nWhat meed of honour, if thou dost my will,\nThou shalt apportion to thyself and me?\nFor who, beholding us, what citizen,\nWhat foreigner, will not extend the hand\nOf admiration, and exclaim, ‘See, friends,\nThese scions of one stock, these noble twain,\nThese that have saved their father’s house from woe,\nWho once when foes were mighty, set their life\nUpon a cast, and stood forth to avenge\nThe stain of blood! Who will not love the pair\n[page 158][981-1018]And do them reverence? Who will not give\nHonour at festivals, and in the throng\nOf popular resort, to these in chief,\nFor their high courage and their bold emprise?’\nSuch fame will follow us in all the world.\nLiving or dying, still to be renowned.\nAh, then, comply, dear sister; give thy sire\nThis toil—this labour to thy brother give;\nEnd these my sufferings, end thine own regret:\nThe well-born cannot bear to live in shame.\nCH. In such affairs, for those who speak and hear\nWise thoughtfulness is still the best ally.\nCHR. True, noble women, and before she spake\nSound thought should have prevented the rash talk\nThat now hath proved her reckless. What wild aim\nBeckons thee forth in arming this design\nWhereto thou wouldst demand my ministry?\nDost not perceive, thou art not man but woman,\nOf strength inferior to thine enemies,—\nTheir Genius daily prospering more and more,\nWhilst ours is dwindling into nothingness?\nWho then that plots against a life so strong\nShall quit him of the danger without harm?\nTake heed we do not add to our distress\nShould some one hear of this our colloquy.\nSmall help and poor advantage ’twere for us\nTo win brief praise and then inglorious die.\nNay, death is not so hateful as when one\nDesiring death is balked of that desire.\nAnd I beseech thee, ere in utter ruin\nWe perish and make desolate our race,\nRefrain thy rage. And I will guard for thee\nIn silence these thy words unrealized;\nIf thou wilt learn this wisdom from long time,\nHaving no strength, to bend before the strong.\nCH. Comply. Than prudence and a heedful mind,\nNo fairer treasure can be found for men.\nEL. Thy words have not surprised me. Well I knew\nThe good I offered would come back with scorn.\n[page 159][1019-1052]I, all alone and with a single hand,\nMust do this. For it shall not rest undone.\nCHR. Would thou hadst been thus minded when our sire\nLay dying! In one act thou hadst compassed all.\nEL. My spirit was the same: my mind was less.\nCHR. Be such the life-long temper of thy mind!\nEL. Thine admonition augurs little aid.\nCHR. Yea. For the attempt would bring me certain bane.\nEL. I envy thee thy prudence, hate thy fear.\nCHR. Even when thou speak’st me fair, I will endure it.\nEL. Take heart. That never will be thine from me.\nCHR. Long time remains to settle that account.\nEL. I find no profit in thee. Go thy way.\nCHR. Profit there is, hadst thou a mind to learn.\nEL. Go to thy mother and declare all this!\nCHR. I am not so in hatred of thy life.\nEL. Yet know the shame thou wouldst prepare for me.\nCHR. No, no! Not shame, but care for thine estate.\nEL. Must I still follow as thou thinkest good?\nCHR. When thou hast wisdom, thou shalt be the guide.\nEL. ’Tis hard when error wears the garb of sense.\nCHR. Right. That is the misfortune of your case.\nEL. Why? Feel you not the justice of my speech?\nCHR. Justice may chance to bring me injury.\nEL. I care not, I, to live by such a rule.\nCHR. Well, if you do it, you will find me wise.\nEL. Well, I will do it, nought dismayed by thee.\nCHR. Speak you plain sooth? and will you not be counselled?\nEL. No, for bad counsel is of all most hateful.\nCHR. You take the sense of nothing that I say.\nEL. Long since, not newly, my resolve is firm.\nCHR. Then I will go. Thy heart will ne’er be brought\nTo praise my words, nor I thine action here.\nEL. Then go within! I will not follow thee,\n[page 160][1053-1089]Though thou desire it vehemently. None\nWould be so fond to hunt on a cold trail.\nCHR.

Nor fear\nShe should behold me with a smiling face.\nMine ancient hate of her hath sunk too deep.\nAnd from the time I saw thee, tears of joy\nWill cease not. Wherefore should I stint their flow?\nI, who in this thy coming have beheld\nThee dead and living? Strangely hast thou wrought\nOn me;—that should my father come alive,\nI would not think the sight were miracle,\nBut sober truth. Since such thy presence, then,\nLead as thy spirit prompts. For I alone\nOf two things surely had achieved one,\nNoble deliverance or a noble death.\nOR. Be silent; for I hear within the house\nA footstep coming forth.\nEL. (loudly).

    "content":"OEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nOedipus, the blind and banished King of Thebes, has come in his wanderings to Colonus, a deme of Athens, led by his daughter Antigone. He sits to rest on a rock just within a sacred grove of the Furies and is bidden depart by a passing native. But Oedipus, instructed by an oracle that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to stir, and the stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the Chorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at first the blind beggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are horror-striken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will confer on the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus. From Theseus Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil; the benefits that will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs having promised to aid and befriend him. No sooner has he gone than Creon enters with an armed guard who seize Antigone and carry her off (Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured) and he is about to lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard the tumult, hurries up and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to detain him till he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the next scene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs Oedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon wishes to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father’s forgiveness and blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to the side that Oedipus espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and invokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of thunder is heard, and as peal follows peal, Oedipus is aware that his hour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus. Self-guided he leads the way to the spot where death should overtake him, attended by Theseus and his daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell, and what followed none but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports) for the gods took him.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nOEDIPUS, banished King of Thebes.\nANTIGONE, his daughter.\nISMENE, his daughter.\nTHESEUS, King of Athens.\nCREON, brother of Jocasta, now reigning at Thebes.\nPOLYNEICES, elder son of Oedipus.\nSTRANGER, a native of Colonus.\nMESSENGER, an attendant of Theseus.\nCHORUS, citizens of Colonus.\nScene: In front of the grove of the Eumenides.\nOEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nEnter the blind OEDIPUS led by his daughter, ANTIGONE.\nOEDIPUS.\nChild of an old blind sire, Antigone,\nWhat region, say, whose city have we reached?\nWho will provide today with scanted dole\nThis wanderer? ’Tis little that he craves,\nAnd less obtains—that less enough for me;\nFor I am taught by suffering to endure,\nAnd the long years that have grown old with me,\nAnd last not least, by true nobility.\nMy daughter, if thou seest a resting place\nOn common ground or by some sacred grove,\nStay me and set me down. Let us discover\nWhere we have come, for strangers must inquire\nOf denizens, and do as they are bid.\nANTIGONE.\nLong-suffering father, Oedipus, the towers\nThat fence the city still are faint and far;\nBut where we stand is surely holy ground;\nA wilderness of laurel, olive, vine;\nWithin a choir or songster nightingales\nAre warbling.

To tell him aught or urge his coming?\nOEDIPUS.\nSay a slight service may avail him much.\nSTRANGER.\nHow can he profit from a sightless man?\nOEDIPUS.\nThe blind man’s words will be instinct with sight.\nSTRANGER.\nHeed then; I fain would see thee out of harm;\nFor by the looks, marred though they be by fate,\nI judge thee noble; tarry where thou art,\nWhile I go seek the burghers—those at hand,\nNot in the city. They will soon decide\nWhether thou art to rest or go thy way.\n[Exit STRANGER]\nOEDIPUS.\nTell me, my daughter, has the stranger gone?\nANTIGONE.\nYes, he has gone; now we are all alone,\nAnd thou may’st speak, dear father, without fear.\nOEDIPUS.\nStern-visaged queens, since coming to this land\nFirst in your sanctuary I bent the knee,\nFrown not on me or Phoebus, who, when erst\nHe told me all my miseries to come,\nSpake of this respite after many years,\nSome haven in a far-off land, a rest\nVouchsafed at last by dread divinities.\n“There,” said he, “shalt thou round thy weary life,\nA blessing to the land wherein thou dwell’st,\nBut to the land that cast thee forth, a curse.”\nAnd of my weird he promised signs should come,\nEarthquake, or thunderclap, or lightning flash.\nAnd now I recognize as yours the sign\nThat led my wanderings to this your grove;\nElse had I never lighted on you first,\nA wineless man on your seat of native rock.\nO goddesses, fulfill Apollo’s word,\nGrant me some consummation of my life,\nIf haply I appear not all too vile,\nA thrall to sorrow worse than any slave.\nHear, gentle daughters of primeval Night,\nHear, namesake of great Pallas; Athens, first\nOf cities, pity this dishonored shade,\nThe ghost of him who once was Oedipus.\nANTIGONE.\nHush! for I see some grey-beards on their way,\nTheir errand to spy out our resting-place.\nOEDIPUS.\nI will be mute, and thou shalt guide my steps\nInto the covert from the public road,\nTill I have learned their drift. A prudent man\nWill ever shape his course by what he learns.\n[Enter CHORUS]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nHa! Where is he?

Yet am I then\nA villain born because in self-defense,\nStriken, I struck the striker back again?\nE’en had I known, no villainy ’twould prove:\nBut all unwitting whither I went, I went—\nTo ruin; my destroyers knew it well,\nWherefore, I pray you, sirs, in Heaven’s name,\nEven as ye bade me quit my seat, defend me.\nO pay not a lip service to the gods\nAnd wrong them of their dues. Bethink ye well,\nThe eye of Heaven beholds the just of men,\nAnd the unjust, nor ever in this world\nHas one sole godless sinner found escape.\nStand then on Heaven’s side and never blot\nAthens’ fair scutcheon by abetting wrong.\nI came to you a suppliant, and you pledged\nYour honor; O preserve me to the end,\nO let not this marred visage do me wrong!\nA holy and god-fearing man is here\nWhose coming purports comfort for your folk.\nAnd when your chief arrives, whoe’er he be,\nThen shall ye have my story and know all.\nMeanwhile I pray you do me no despite.\nCHORUS.\nThe plea thou urgest, needs must give us pause,\nSet forth in weighty argument, but we\nMust leave the issue with the ruling powers.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere is he, strangers, he who sways the realm?\nCHORUS.\nIn his ancestral seat; a messenger,\nThe same who sent us here, is gone for him.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd think you he will have such care or thought\nFor the blind stranger as to come himself?\nCHORUS.\nAye, that he will, when once he learns thy name.\nOEDIPUS.\nBut who will bear him word!\nCHORUS.\nThe way is long,\nAnd many travelers pass to speed the news.\nBe sure he’ll hear and hasten, never fear;\nSo wide and far thy name is noised abroad,\nThat, were he ne’er so spent and loth to move,\nHe would bestir him when he hears of thee.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell, may he come with blessing to his State\nAnd me! Who serves his neighbor serves himself. 5\nANTIGONE.\nZeus! What is this? What can I say or think?\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat now, Antigone?\nANTIGONE.\nI see a woman\nRiding upon a colt of Aetna’s breed;\nShe wears for headgear a Thessalian hat\nTo shade her from the sun.

The one\nSince first she grew from girlish feebleness\nTo womanhood has been the old man’s guide\nAnd shared my weary wandering, roaming oft\nHungry and footsore through wild forest ways,\nIn drenching rains and under scorching suns,\nCareless herself of home and ease, if so\nHer sire might have her tender ministry.\nAnd thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,\nEluding the Cadmeians’ vigilance,\nTo bring thy father all the oracles\nConcerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself\nMy faithful lieger, when they banished me.\nAnd now what mission summons thee from home,\nWhat news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?\nThis much I know, thou com’st not empty-handed,\nWithout a warning of some new alarm.\nISMENE.\nThe toil and trouble, father, that I bore\nTo find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,\nI spare thee; surely ’twere a double pain\nTo suffer, first in act and then in telling;\n’Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons\nI come to tell thee.

These two maids\nTheir sisters, girls, gave all their sex could give,\nFood and safe harborage and filial care;\nWhile their two brethren sacrificed their sire\nFor lust of power and sceptred sovereignty.\nNo! me they ne’er shall win for an ally,\nNor will this Theban kingship bring them gain;\nThat know I from this maiden’s oracles,\nAnd those old prophecies concerning me,\nWhich Phoebus now at length has brought to pass.\nCome Creon then, come all the mightiest\nIn Thebes to seek me; for if ye my friends,\nChampioned by those dread Powers indigenous,\nEspouse my cause; then for the State ye gain\nA great deliverer, for my foemen bane.\nCHORUS.\nOur pity, Oedipus, thou needs must move,\nThou and these maidens; and the stronger plea\nThou urgest, as the savior of our land,\nDisposes me to counsel for thy weal.\nOEDIPUS.\nAid me, kind sirs; I will do all you bid.\nCHORUS.\nFirst make atonement to the deities,\nWhose grove by trespass thou didst first profane.\nOEDIPUS.\nAfter what manner, stranger?

Having come\nUnto a State that champions right and asks\nFor every action warranty of law,\nThou hast set aside the custom of the land,\nAnd like some freebooter art carrying off\nWhat plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth\nThou thoughtest this a city without men,\nOr manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.\nYet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;\nThebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,\nNor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou\nWert robbing me—aye and the gods to boot,\nHaling by force their suppliants, poor maids.\nWere I on Theban soil, to prosecute\nThe justest claim imaginable, I\nWould never wrest by violence my own\nWithout sanction of your State or King;\nI should behave as fits an outlander\nLiving amongst a foreign folk, but thou\nShamest a city that deserves it not,\nEven thine own, and plentitude of years\nHave made of thee an old man and a fool.\nTherefore again I charge thee as before,\nSee that the maidens are restored at once,\nUnless thou would’st continue here by force\nAnd not by choice a sojourner; so much\nI tell thee home and what I say, I mean.\nCHORUS.\nThy case is perilous; though by birth and race\nThou should’st be just, thou plainly doest wrong.\nCREON.\nNot deeming this city void of men\nOr counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say’st\nI did what I have done; rather I thought\nYour people were not like to set such store\nby kin of mine and keep them ’gainst my will.\nNor would they harbor, so I stood assured,\nA godless parricide, a reprobate\nConvicted of incestuous marriage ties.\nFor on her native hill of Ares here\n(I knew your far-famed Areopagus)\nSits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk\nTo stay within your borders. In that faith\nI hunted down my quarry; and e’en then\nI had refrained but for the curses dire\nWherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:\nSuch wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.\nAnger has no old age but only death;\nThe dead alone can feel no touch of spite.\nSo thou must work thy will; my cause is just\nBut weak without allies; yet will I try,\nOld as I am, to answer deeds with deeds.\nOEDIPUS.\nO shameless railer, think’st thou this abuse\nDefames my grey hairs rather than thine own?\nMurder and incest, deeds of horror, all\nThou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,\nNo willing sinner; so it pleased the gods\nWrath haply with my sinful race of old,\nSince thou could’st find no sin in me myself\nFor which in retribution I was doomed\nTo trespass thus against myself and mine.\nAnswer me now, if by some oracle\nMy sire was destined to a bloody end\nBy a son’s hand, can this reflect on me,\nMe then unborn, begotten by no sire,\nConceived in no mother’s womb? And if\nWhen born to misery, as born I was,\nI met my sire, not knowing whom I met\nor what I did, and slew him, how canst thou\nWith justice blame the all-unconscious hand?\nAnd for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,\nSeeing she was thy sister, to extort\nFrom me the story of her marriage, such\nA marriage as I straightway will proclaim.\nFor I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech\nHas broken all the bonds of reticence.\nShe was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;\nI knew it not, nor she; and she my mother\nBare children to the son whom she had borne,\nA birth of shame. But this at least I know\nWittingly thou aspersest her and me;\nBut I unwitting wed, unwilling speak.\nNay neither in this marriage or this deed\nWhich thou art ever casting in my teeth—\nA murdered sire—shall I be held to blame.\nCome, answer me one question, if thou canst:\nIf one should presently attempt thy life,\nWould’st thou, O man of justice, first inquire\nIf the assassin was perchance thy sire,\nOr turn upon him? As thou lov’st thy life,\nOn thy aggressor thou would’st turn, no stay\nDebating, if the law would bear thee out.\nSuch was my case, and such the pass whereto\nThe gods reduced me; and methinks my sire,\nCould he come back to life, would not dissent.\nYet thou, for just thou art not, but a man\nWho sticks at nothing, if it serve his plea,\nReproachest me with this before these men.\nIt serves thy turn to laud great Theseus’ name,\nAnd Athens as a wisely governed State;\nYet in thy flatteries one thing is to seek:\nIf any land knows how to pay the gods\nTheir proper rites, ’tis Athens most of all.\nThis is the land whence thou wast fain to steal\nTheir aged suppliant and hast carried off\nMy daughters. Therefore to yon goddesses,\nI turn, adjure them and invoke their aid\nTo champion my cause, that thou mayest learn\nWhat is the breed of men who guard this State.\nCHORUS.\nAn honest man, my liege, one sore bestead\nBy fortune, and so worthy our support.\nTHESEUS.\nEnough of words; the captors speed amain,\nWhile we the victims stand debating here.\nCREON.\nWhat would’st thou?

By a god-sent, painless doom, poor soul?\nMESSENGER.\nThy question hits the marvel of the tale.\nHow he moved hence, you saw him and must know;\nWithout a friend to lead the way, himself\nGuiding us all. So having reached the abrupt\nEarth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,\nHe paused at one of the converging paths,\nHard by the rocky basin which records\nThe pact of Theseus and Peirithous.\nBetwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,\nThe hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,\nMidway he sat and loosed his beggar’s weeds;\nThen calling to his daughters bade them fetch\nOf running water, both to wash withal\nAnd make libation; so they clomb the steep;\nAnd in brief space brought what their father bade,\nThen laved and dressed him with observance due.\nBut when he had his will in everything,\nAnd no desire was left unsatisfied,\nIt thundered from the netherworld; the maids\nShivered, and crouching at their father’s knees\nWept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.\nHe, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,\nFolded his arms about them both and said,\n“My children, ye will lose your sire today,\nFor all of me has perished, and no more\nHave ye to bear your long, long ministry;\nA heavy load, I know, and yet one word\nWipes out all score of tribulations—love.\nAnd love from me ye had—from no man more;\nBut now must live without me all your days.”\nSo clinging to each other sobbed and wept\nFather and daughters both, but when at last\nTheir mourning had an end and no wail rose,\nA moment there was silence; suddenly\nA voice that summoned him; with sudden dread\nThe hair of all stood up and all were ’mazed;\nFor the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.\n“Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?\nToo long, too long thy passing is delayed.”\nBut when he heard the summons of the god,\nHe prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when\nThe Prince came nearer: “O my friend,” he cried,\n“Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand—\nAnd, daughters, give him yours—and promise me\nThou never wilt forsake them, but do all\nThat time and friendship prompt in their behoof.”\nAnd he of his nobility repressed\nHis tears and swore to be their constant friend.\nThis promise given, Oedipus put forth\nBlind hands and laid them on his children, saying,\n“O children, prove your true nobility\nAnd hence depart nor seek to witness sights\nUnlawful or to hear unlawful words.\nNay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,\nOur ruler, to behold what next shall hap.”\nSo we all heard him speak, and weeping sore\nWe companied the maidens on their way.\nAfter brief space we looked again, and lo\nThe man was gone, evanished from our eyes;\nOnly the king we saw with upraised hand\nShading his eyes as from some awful sight,\nThat no man might endure to look upon.\nA moment later, and we saw him bend\nIn prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.\nBut by what doom the stranger met his end\nNo man save Theseus knoweth. For there fell\nNo fiery bold that reft him in that hour,\nNor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.\nIt was a messenger from heaven, or else\nSome gentle, painless cleaving of earth’s base;\nFor without wailing or disease or pain\nHe passed away—and end most marvelous.\nAnd if to some my tale seems foolishness\nI am content that such could count me fool.\nCHORUS.\nWhere are the maids and their attendant friends?\nMESSENGER.\nThey cannot be far off; the approaching sound\nOf lamentation tells they come this way.\n[Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE]\nANTIGONE.\n(Str. 1)\nWoe, woe! on this sad day\nWe sisters of one blasted stock\nmust bow beneath the shock,\nMust weep and weep the curse that lay\nOn him our sire, for whom\nIn life, a life-long world of care\n’Twas ours to bear,\nIn death must face the gloom\nThat wraps his tomb.\nWhat tongue can tell\nThat sight ineffable?\nCHORUS.\nWhat mean ye, maidens?\nANTIGONE.\nAll is but surmise.\nCHORUS.\nIs he then gone?\nANTIGONE.\nGone as ye most might wish.\nNot in battle or sea storm,\nBut reft from sight,\nBy hands invisible borne\nTo viewless fields of night.\nAh me! on us too night has come,\nThe night of mourning.

    "content":"OEDIPUS THE KING\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nTo Laius, King of Thebes, an oracle foretold that the child born to him by his queen Jocasta would slay his father and wed his mother. So when in time a son was born the infant’s feet were riveted together and he was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy, who grew up believing that he was indeed the King’s son. Afterwards doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he deemed his father’s house and in his flight he encountered and unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king. So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen. Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man. The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nOedipus.\nThe Priest of Zeus.\nCreon.\nChorus of Theban Elders.\nTeiresias.\nJocasta.\nMessenger.\nHerd of Laius.\nSecond Messenger.\nScene: Thebes. Before the Palace of Oedipus.\nOEDIPUS THE KING\nSuppliants of all ages are seated round the altar at the palace doors,\nat their head a PRIEST OF ZEUS. To them enter OEDIPUS.\nOEDIPUS.\nMy children, latest born to Cadmus old,\nWhy sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands\nBranches of olive filleted with wool?\nWhat means this reek of incense everywhere,\nAnd everywhere laments and litanies?\nChildren, it were not meet that I should learn\nFrom others, and am hither come, myself,\nI Oedipus, your world-renowned king.\nHo! aged sire, whose venerable locks\nProclaim thee spokesman of this company,\nExplain your mood and purport. Is it dread\nOf ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?\nMy zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;\nRuthless indeed were I and obdurate\nIf such petitioners as you I spurned.\nPRIEST.\nYea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,\nThou seest how both extremes of age besiege\nThy palace altars—fledglings hardly winged,\nand greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I\nof Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.\nMeanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs\nCrowd our two market-places, or before\nBoth shrines of Pallas congregate, or where\nIsmenus gives his oracles by fire.\nFor, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,\nSore buffeted, can no more lift her head,\nFoundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.\nA blight is on our harvest in the ear,\nA blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,\nA blight on wives in travail; and withal\nArmed with his blazing torch the God of Plague\nHath swooped upon our city emptying\nThe house of Cadmus, and the murky realm\nOf Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.\nTherefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,\nI and these children; not as deeming thee\nA new divinity, but the first of men;\nFirst in the common accidents of life,\nAnd first in visitations of the Gods.\nArt thou not he who coming to the town\nof Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid\nTo the fell songstress? Nor hadst thou received\nPrompting from us or been by others schooled;\nNo, by a god inspired (so all men deem,\nAnd testify) didst thou renew our life.\nAnd now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,\nAll we thy votaries beseech thee, find\nSome succor, whether by a voice from heaven\nWhispered, or haply known by human wit.\nTried counselors, methinks, are aptest found1\nTo furnish for the future pregnant rede.\nUpraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!\nLook to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore\nOur country’s savior thou art justly hailed:\nO never may we thus record thy reign:—\n“He raised us up only to cast us down.”\nUplift us, build our city on a rock.\nThy happy star ascendant brought us luck,\nO let it not decline! If thou wouldst rule\nThis land, as now thou reignest, better sure\nTo rule a peopled than a desert realm.\nNor battlements nor galleys aught avail,\nIf men to man and guards to guard them tail.\nOEDIPUS.\nAh! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,\nThe quest that brings you hither and your need.\nYe sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,\nHow great soever yours, outtops it all.\nYour sorrow touches each man severally,\nHim and none other, but I grieve at once\nBoth for the general and myself and you.\nTherefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.\nMany, my children, are the tears I’ve wept,\nAnd threaded many a maze of weary thought.\nThus pondering one clue of hope I caught,\nAnd tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus’ son,\nCreon, my consort’s brother, to inquire\nOf Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,\nHow I might save the State by act or word.\nAnd now I reckon up the tale of days\nSince he set forth, and marvel how he fares.\n’Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.\nBut when he comes, then I were base indeed,\nIf I perform not all the god declares.\nPRIEST.\nThy words are well timed; even as thou speakest\nThat shouting tells me Creon is at hand.\nOEDIPUS.\nO King Apollo! may his joyous looks\nBe presage of the joyous news he brings!\nPRIEST.\nAs I surmise, ’tis welcome; else his head\nHad scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.\nOEDIPUS.\nWe soon shall know; he’s now in earshot range.\n[Enter CREON]\nMy royal cousin, say, Menoeceus’ child,\nWhat message hast thou brought us from the god?\nCREON.\nGood news, for e’en intolerable ills,\nFinding right issue, tend to naught but good.\nOEDIPUS.\nHow runs the oracle? thus far thy words\nGive me no ground for confidence or fear.\nCREON.\nIf thou wouldst hear my message publicly,\nI’ll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.\nOEDIPUS.\nSpeak before all; the burden that I bear\nIs more for these my subjects than myself.\nCREON.\nLet me report then all the god declared.\nKing Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate\nA fell pollution that infests the land,\nAnd no more harbor an inveterate sore.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat expiation means he? What’s amiss?\nCREON.\nBanishment, or the shedding blood for blood.\nThis stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?\nCREON.\nBefore thou didst assume the helm of State,\nThe sovereign of this land was Laius.\nOEDIPUS.\nI heard as much, but never saw the man.\nCREON.\nHe fell; and now the god’s command is plain:\nPunish his takers-off, whoe’er they be.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere are they? Where in the wide world to find\nThe far, faint traces of a bygone crime?\nCREON.\nIn this land, said the god; “who seeks shall find;\nWho sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind.”\nOEDIPUS.\nWas he within his palace, or afield,\nOr traveling, when Laius met his fate?\nCREON.\nAbroad; he started, so he told us, bound\nFor Delphi, but he never thence returned.\nOEDIPUS.\nCame there no news, no fellow-traveler\nTo give some clue that might be followed up?\nCREON.\nBut one escape, who flying for dear life,\nCould tell of all he saw but one thing sure.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd what was that? One clue might lead us far,\nWith but a spark of hope to guide our quest.\nCREON.\nRobbers, he told us, not one bandit but\nA troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.\nOEDIPUS.\nDid any bandit dare so bold a stroke,\nUnless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?\nCREON.\nSo ’twas surmised, but none was found to avenge\nHis murder mid the trouble that ensued.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat trouble can have hindered a full quest,\nWhen royalty had fallen thus miserably?\nCREON.\nThe riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide\nThe dim past and attend to instant needs.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell, I will start afresh and once again\nMake dark things clear. Right worthy the concern\nOf Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;\nI also, as is meet, will lend my aid\nTo avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.\nNot for some far-off kinsman, but myself,\nShall I expel this poison in the blood;\nFor whoso slew that king might have a mind\nTo strike me too with his assassin hand.\nTherefore in righting him I serve myself.\nUp, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,\nTake hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither\nThe Theban commons. With the god’s good help\nSuccess is sure; ’tis ruin if we fail.\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and CREON]\nPRIEST.\nCome, children, let us hence; these gracious words\nForestall the very purpose of our suit.\nAnd may the god who sent this oracle\nSave us withal and rid us of this pest.\n[Exeunt PRIEST and SUPPLIANTS]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nSweet-voiced daughter of Zeus from thy gold-paved Pythian shrine\nWafted to Thebes divine,\nWhat dost thou bring me? My soul is racked and shivers with fear.\n(Healer of Delos, hear!)\nHast thou some pain unknown before,\nOr with the circling years renewest a penance of yore?\nOffspring of golden Hope, thou voice immortal, O tell me.\n(Ant. 1)\nFirst on Athene I call; O Zeus-born goddess, defend!\nGoddess and sister, befriend,\nArtemis, Lady of Thebes, high-throned in the midst of our mart!\nLord of the death-winged dart!\nYour threefold aid I crave\nFrom death and ruin our city to save.\nIf in the days of old when we nigh had perished, ye drave\nFrom our land the fiery plague, be near us now and defend us!\n(Str. 2)\nAh me, what countless woes are mine!\nAll our host is in decline;\nWeaponless my spirit lies.\nEarth her gracious fruits denies;\nWomen wail in barren throes;\nLife on life downstriken goes,\nSwifter than the wind bird’s flight,\nSwifter than the Fire-God’s might,\nTo the westering shores of Night.\n(Ant. 2)\nWasted thus by death on death\nAll our city perisheth.\nCorpses spread infection round;\nNone to tend or mourn is found.\nWailing on the altar stair\nWives and grandams rend the air—\nLong-drawn moans and piercing cries\nBlent with prayers and litanies.\nGolden child of Zeus, O hear\nLet thine angel face appear!\n(Str. 3)\nAnd grant that Ares whose hot breath I feel,\nThough without targe or steel\nHe stalks, whose voice is as the battle shout,\nMay turn in sudden rout,\nTo the unharbored Thracian waters sped,\nOr Amphitrite’s bed.\nFor what night leaves undone,\nSmit by the morrow’s sun\nPerisheth. Father Zeus, whose hand\nDoth wield the lightning brand,\nSlay him beneath thy levin bold, we pray,\nSlay him, O slay!\n(Ant. 3)\nO that thine arrows too, Lycean King,\nFrom that taut bow’s gold string,\nMight fly abroad, the champions of our rights;\nYea, and the flashing lights\nOf Artemis, wherewith the huntress sweeps\nAcross the Lycian steeps.\nThee too I call with golden-snooded hair,\nWhose name our land doth bear,\nBacchus to whom thy Maenads Evoe shout;\nCome with thy bright torch, rout,\nBlithe god whom we adore,\nThe god whom gods abhor.\n[Enter OEDIPUS.]\nOEDIPUS.\nYe pray; ’tis well, but would ye hear my words\nAnd heed them and apply the remedy,\nYe might perchance find comfort and relief.\nMind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger\nTo this report, no less than to the crime;\nFor how unaided could I track it far\nWithout a clue? Which lacking (for too late\nWas I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)\nThis proclamation I address to all:—\nThebans, if any knows the man by whom\nLaius, son of Labdacus, was slain,\nI summon him to make clean shrift to me.\nAnd if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus\nConfessing he shall ’scape the capital charge;\nFor the worst penalty that shall befall him\nIs banishment—unscathed he shall depart.\nBut if an alien from a foreign land\nBe known to any as the murderer,\nLet him who knows speak out, and he shall have\nDue recompense from me and thanks to boot.\nBut if ye still keep silence, if through fear\nFor self or friends ye disregard my hest,\nHear what I then resolve; I lay my ban\nOn the assassin whosoe’er he be.\nLet no man in this land, whereof I hold\nThe sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;\nGive him no part in prayer or sacrifice\nOr lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.\nFor this is our defilement, so the god\nHath lately shown to me by oracles.\nThus as their champion I maintain the cause\nBoth of the god and of the murdered King.\nAnd on the murderer this curse I lay\n(On him and all the partners in his guilt):—\nWretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!\nAnd for myself, if with my privity\nHe gain admittance to my hearth, I pray\nThe curse I laid on others fall on me.\nSee that ye give effect to all my hest,\nFor my sake and the god’s and for our land,\nA desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.\nFor, let alone the god’s express command,\nIt were a scandal ye should leave unpurged\nThe murder of a great man and your king,\nNor track it home. And now that I am lord,\nSuccessor to his throne, his bed, his wife,\n(And had he not been frustrate in the hope\nOf issue, common children of one womb\nHad forced a closer bond twixt him and me,\nBut Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I\nHis blood-avenger will maintain his cause\nAs though he were my sire, and leave no stone\nUnturned to track the assassin or avenge\nThe son of Labdacus, of Polydore,\nOf Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.\nAnd for the disobedient thus I pray:\nMay the gods send them neither timely fruits\nOf earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,\nBut may they waste and pine, as now they waste,\nAye and worse stricken; but to all of you,\nMy loyal subjects who approve my acts,\nMay Justice, our ally, and all the gods\nBe gracious and attend you evermore.\nCHORUS.\nThe oath thou profferest, sire, I take and swear.\nI slew him not myself, nor can I name\nThe slayer. For the quest, ’twere well, methinks\nThat Phoebus, who proposed the riddle, himself\nShould give the answer—who the murderer was.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell argued; but no living man can hope\nTo force the gods to speak against their will.\nCHORUS.\nMay I then say what seems next best to me?\nOEDIPUS.\nAye, if there be a third best, tell it too.\nCHORUS.\nMy liege, if any man sees eye to eye\nWith our lord Phoebus, ’tis our prophet, lord\nTeiresias; he of all men best might guide\nA searcher of this matter to the light.\nOEDIPUS.\nHere too my zeal has nothing lagged, for twice\nAt Creon’s instance have I sent to fetch him,\nAnd long I marvel why he is not here.\nCHORUS.\nI mind me too of rumors long ago—\nMere gossip.\nOEDIPUS.\nTell them, I would fain know all.\nCHORUS.\n’Twas said he fell by travelers.\nOEDIPUS.\nSo I heard,\nBut none has seen the man who saw him fall.\nCHORUS.\nWell, if he knows what fear is, he will quail\nAnd flee before the terror of thy curse.\nOEDIPUS.\nWords scare not him who blenches not at deeds.\nCHORUS.\nBut here is one to arraign him. Lo, at length\nThey bring the god-inspired seer in whom\nAbove all other men is truth inborn.\n[Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy.]\nOEDIPUS.\nTeiresias, seer who comprehendest all,\nLore of the wise and hidden mysteries,\nHigh things of heaven and low things of the earth,\nThou knowest, though thy blinded eyes see naught,\nWhat plague infects our city; and we turn\nTo thee, O seer, our one defense and shield.\nThe purport of the answer that the God\nReturned to us who sought his oracle,\nThe messengers have doubtless told thee—how\nOne course alone could rid us of the pest,\nTo find the murderers of Laius,\nAnd slay them or expel them from the land.\nTherefore begrudging neither augury\nNor other divination that is thine,\nO save thyself, thy country, and thy king,\nSave all from this defilement of blood shed.\nOn thee we rest. This is man’s highest end,\nTo others’ service all his powers to lend.\nTEIRESIAS.\nAlas, alas, what misery to be wise\nWhen wisdom profits nothing! This old lore\nI had forgotten; else I were not here.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat ails thee? Why this melancholy mood?\nTEIRESIAS.\nLet me go home; prevent me not; ’twere best\nThat thou shouldst bear thy burden and I mine.\nOEDIPUS.\nFor shame! no true-born Theban patriot\nWould thus withhold the word of prophecy.\nTEIRESIAS.\nThy words, O king, are wide of the mark, and I\nFor fear lest I too trip like thee...\nOEDIPUS.\nOh speak,\nWithhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know’st,\nThy knowledge. We are all thy suppliants.\nTEIRESIAS.\nAye, for ye all are witless, but my voice\nWill ne’er reveal my miseries—or thine.2\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat then, thou knowest, and yet willst not speak!\nWouldst thou betray us and destroy the State?\nTEIRESIAS.\nI will not vex myself nor thee. Why ask\nThus idly what from me thou shalt not learn?\nOEDIPUS.\nMonster! thy silence would incense a flint.\nWill nothing loose thy tongue? Can nothing melt thee,\nOr shake thy dogged taciturnity?\nTEIRESIAS.\nThou blam’st my mood and seest not thine own\nWherewith thou art mated; no, thou taxest me.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd who could stay his choler when he heard\nHow insolently thou dost flout the State?\nTEIRESIAS.\nWell, it will come what will, though I be mute.\nOEDIPUS.\nSince come it must, thy duty is to tell me.\nTEIRESIAS.\nI have no more to say; storm as thou willst,\nAnd give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.\nOEDIPUS.\nYea, I am wroth, and will not stint my words,\nBut speak my whole mind. Thou methinks thou art he,\nWho planned the crime, aye, and performed it too,\nAll save the assassination; and if thou\nHadst not been blind, I had been sworn to boot\nThat thou alone didst do the bloody deed.\nTEIRESIAS.\nIs it so? Then I charge thee to abide\nBy thine own proclamation; from this day\nSpeak not to these or me.

When the riddling Sphinx was here\nWhy hadst thou no deliverance for this folk?\nAnd yet the riddle was not to be solved\nBy guess-work but required the prophet’s art;\nWherein thou wast found lacking; neither birds\nNor sign from heaven helped thee, but I came,\nThe simple Oedipus; I stopped her mouth\nBy mother wit, untaught of auguries.\nThis is the man whom thou wouldst undermine,\nIn hope to reign with Creon in my stead.\nMethinks that thou and thine abettor soon\nWill rue your plot to drive the scapegoat out.\nThank thy grey hairs that thou hast still to learn\nWhat chastisement such arrogance deserves.\nCHORUS.\nTo us it seems that both the seer and thou,\nO Oedipus, have spoken angry words.\nThis is no time to wrangle but consult\nHow best we may fulfill the oracle.\nTEIRESIAS.\nKing as thou art, free speech at least is mine\nTo make reply; in this I am thy peer.\nI own no lord but Loxias; him I serve\nAnd ne’er can stand enrolled as Creon’s man.\nThus then I answer: since thou hast not spared\nTo twit me with my blindness—thou hast eyes,\nYet see’st not in what misery thou art fallen,\nNor where thou dwellest nor with whom for mate.\nDost know thy lineage? Nay, thou know’st it not,\nAnd all unwitting art a double foe\nTo thine own kin, the living and the dead;\nAye and the dogging curse of mother and sire\nOne day shall drive thee, like a two-edged sword,\nBeyond our borders, and the eyes that now\nSee clear shall henceforward endless night.\nAh whither shall thy bitter cry not reach,\nWhat crag in all Cithaeron but shall then\nReverberate thy wail, when thou hast found\nWith what a hymeneal thou wast borne\nHome, but to no fair haven, on the gale!\nAye, and a flood of ills thou guessest not\nShall set thyself and children in one line.\nFlout then both Creon and my words, for none\nOf mortals shall be striken worse than thou.\nOEDIPUS.\nMust I endure this fellow’s insolence?\nA murrain on thee!

First, I bid thee think,\nWould any mortal choose a troubled reign\nOf terrors rather than secure repose,\nIf the same power were given him? As for me,\nI have no natural craving for the name\nOf king, preferring to do kingly deeds,\nAnd so thinks every sober-minded man.\nNow all my needs are satisfied through thee,\nAnd I have naught to fear; but were I king,\nMy acts would oft run counter to my will.\nHow could a title then have charms for me\nAbove the sweets of boundless influence?\nI am not so infatuate as to grasp\nThe shadow when I hold the substance fast.\nNow all men cry me Godspeed! wish me well,\nAnd every suitor seeks to gain my ear,\nIf he would hope to win a grace from thee.\nWhy should I leave the better, choose the worse?\nThat were sheer madness, and I am not mad.\nNo such ambition ever tempted me,\nNor would I have a share in such intrigue.\nAnd if thou doubt me, first to Delphi go,\nThere ascertain if my report was true\nOf the god’s answer; next investigate\nIf with the seer I plotted or conspired,\nAnd if it prove so, sentence me to death,\nNot by thy voice alone, but mine and thine.\nBut O condemn me not, without appeal,\nOn bare suspicion. ’Tis not right to adjudge\nBad men at random good, or good men bad.\nI would as lief a man should cast away\nThe thing he counts most precious, his own life,\nAs spurn a true friend.

To banish me the land?\nOEDIPUS.\nI would not have thee banished, no, but dead,\nThat men may mark the wages envy reaps.\nCREON.\nI see thou wilt not yield, nor credit me.\nOEDIPUS.\n[None but a fool would credit such as thou.]3\nCREON.\nThou art not wise.\nOEDIPUS.\nWise for myself at least.\nCREON.\nWhy not for me too?\nOEDIPUS.\nWhy for such a knave?\nCREON.\nSuppose thou lackest sense.\nOEDIPUS.\nYet kings must rule.\nCREON.\nNot if they rule ill.\nOEDIPUS.\nOh my Thebans, hear him!\nCREON.\nThy Thebans? am not I a Theban too?\nCHORUS.\nCease, princes; lo there comes, and none too soon,\nJocasta from the palace.

An oracle\nOnce came to Laius (I will not say\n’Twas from the Delphic god himself, but from\nHis ministers) declaring he was doomed\nTo perish by the hand of his own son,\nA child that should be born to him by me.\nNow Laius—so at least report affirmed—\nWas murdered on a day by highwaymen,\nNo natives, at a spot where three roads meet.\nAs for the child, it was but three days old,\nWhen Laius, its ankles pierced and pinned\nTogether, gave it to be cast away\nBy others on the trackless mountain side.\nSo then Apollo brought it not to pass\nThe child should be his father’s murderer,\nOr the dread terror find accomplishment,\nAnd Laius be slain by his own son.\nSuch was the prophet’s horoscope. O king,\nRegard it not. Whate’er the god deems fit\nTo search, himself unaided will reveal.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat memories, what wild tumult of the soul\nCame o’er me, lady, as I heard thee speak!\nJOCASTA.\nWhat mean’st thou? What has shocked and startled thee?\nOEDIPUS.\nMethought I heard thee say that Laius\nWas murdered at the meeting of three roads.\nJOCASTA.\nSo ran the story that is current still.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere did this happen? Dost thou know the place?\nJOCASTA.\nPhocis the land is called; the spot is where\nBranch roads from Delphi and from Daulis meet.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd how long is it since these things befell?\nJOCASTA.\n’Twas but a brief while were thou wast proclaimed\nOur country’s ruler that the news was brought.\nOEDIPUS.\nO Zeus, what hast thou willed to do with me!\nJOCASTA.\nWhat is it, Oedipus, that moves thee so?\nOEDIPUS.\nAsk me not yet; tell me the build and height\nOf Laius? Was he still in manhood’s prime?\nJOCASTA.\nTall was he, and his hair was lightly strewn\nWith silver; and not unlike thee in form.\nOEDIPUS.\nO woe is me! Mehtinks unwittingly\nI laid but now a dread curse on myself.\nJOCASTA.\nWhat say’st thou? When I look upon thee, my king,\nI tremble.\nOEDIPUS.\n’Tis a dread presentiment\nThat in the end the seer will prove not blind.\nOne further question to resolve my doubt.\nJOCASTA.\nI quail; but ask, and I will answer all.\nOEDIPUS.\nHad he but few attendants or a train\nOf armed retainers with him, like a prince?\nJOCASTA.\nThey were but five in all, and one of them\nA herald; Laius in a mule-car rode.\nOEDIPUS.\nAlas! ’tis clear as noonday now. But say,\nLady, who carried this report to Thebes?\nJOCASTA.\nA serf, the sole survivor who returned.\nOEDIPUS.\nHaply he is at hand or in the house?\nJOCASTA.\nNo, for as soon as he returned and found\nThee reigning in the stead of Laius slain,\nHe clasped my hand and supplicated me\nTo send him to the alps and pastures, where\nHe might be farthest from the sight of Thebes.\nAnd so I sent him. ’Twas an honest slave\nAnd well deserved some better recompense.\nOEDIPUS.\nFetch him at once. I fain would see the man.\nJOCASTA.\nHe shall be brought; but wherefore summon him?\nOEDIPUS.\nLady, I fear my tongue has overrun\nDiscretion; therefore I would question him.\nJOCASTA.\nWell, he shall come, but may not I too claim\nTo share the burden of thy heart, my king?\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish.\nNow my imaginings have gone so far.\nWho has a higher claim that thou to hear\nMy tale of dire adventures? Listen then.\nMy sire was Polybus of Corinth, and\nMy mother Merope, a Dorian;\nAnd I was held the foremost citizen,\nTill a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,\nYet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.\nA roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,\nShouted “Thou art not true son of thy sire.”\nIt irked me, but I stomached for the nonce\nThe insult; on the morrow I sought out\nMy mother and my sire and questioned them.\nThey were indignant at the random slur\nCast on my parentage and did their best\nTo comfort me, but still the venomed barb\nRankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.\nSo privily without their leave I went\nTo Delphi, and Apollo sent me back\nBaulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.\nBut other grievous things he prophesied,\nWoes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;\nTo wit I should defile my mother’s bed\nAnd raise up seed too loathsome to behold,\nAnd slay the father from whose loins I sprang.\nThen, lady,—thou shalt hear the very truth—\nAs I drew near the triple-branching roads,\nA herald met me and a man who sat\nIn a car drawn by colts—as in thy tale—\nThe man in front and the old man himself\nThreatened to thrust me rudely from the path,\nThen jostled by the charioteer in wrath\nI struck him, and the old man, seeing this,\nWatched till I passed and from his car brought down\nFull on my head the double-pointed goad.\nYet was I quits with him and more; one stroke\nOf my good staff sufficed to fling him clean\nOut of the chariot seat and laid him prone.\nAnd so I slew them every one. But if\nBetwixt this stranger there was aught in common\nWith Laius, who more miserable than I,\nWhat mortal could you find more god-abhorred?\nWretch whom no sojourner, no citizen\nMay harbor or address, whom all are bound\nTo harry from their homes. And this same curse\nWas laid on me, and laid by none but me.\nYea with these hands all gory I pollute\nThe bed of him I slew. Say, am I vile?\nAm I not utterly unclean, a wretch\nDoomed to be banished, and in banishment\nForgo the sight of all my dearest ones,\nAnd never tread again my native earth;\nOr else to wed my mother and slay my sire,\nPolybus, who begat me and upreared?\nIf one should say, this is the handiwork\nOf some inhuman power, who could blame\nHis judgment? But, ye pure and awful gods,\nForbid, forbid that I should see that day!\nMay I be blotted out from living men\nEre such a plague spot set on me its brand!\nCHORUS.\nWe too, O king, are troubled; but till thou\nHast questioned the survivor, still hope on.\nOEDIPUS.\nMy hope is faint, but still enough survives\nTo bid me bide the coming of this herd.\nJOCASTA.\nSuppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?\nOEDIPUS.\nI’ll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees\nWith thine, I shall have ’scaped calamity.\nJOCASTA.\nAnd what of special import did I say?\nOEDIPUS.\nIn thy report of what the herdsman said\nLaius was slain by robbers; now if he\nStill speaks of robbers, not a robber, I\nSlew him not; “one” with “many” cannot square.\nBut if he says one lonely wayfarer,\nThe last link wanting to my guilt is forged.\nJOCASTA.\nWell, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,\nNor can he now retract what then he said;\nNot I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.\nE’en should he vary somewhat in his story,\nHe cannot make the death of Laius\nIn any wise jump with the oracle.\nFor Loxias said expressly he was doomed\nTo die by my child’s hand, but he, poor babe,\nHe shed no blood, but perished first himself.\nSo much for divination. Henceforth I\nWill look for signs neither to right nor left.\nOEDIPUS.\nThou reasonest well. Still I would have thee send\nAnd fetch the bondsman hither. See to it.\nJOCASTA.\nThat will I straightway. Come, let us within.\nI would do nothing that my lord mislikes.\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and JOCASTA]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nMy lot be still to lead\nThe life of innocence and fly\nIrreverence in word or deed,\nTo follow still those laws ordained on high\nWhose birthplace is the bright ethereal sky\nNo mortal birth they own,\nOlympus their progenitor alone:\nNe’er shall they slumber in oblivion cold,\nThe god in them is strong and grows not old.\n(Ant. 1)\nOf insolence is bred\nThe tyrant; insolence full blown,\nWith empty riches surfeited,\nScales the precipitous height and grasps the throne.\nThen topples o’er and lies in ruin prone;\nNo foothold on that dizzy steep.\nBut O may Heaven the true patriot keep\nWho burns with emulous zeal to serve the State.\nGod is my help and hope, on him I wait.\n(Str. 2)\nBut the proud sinner, or in word or deed,\nThat will not Justice heed,\nNor reverence the shrine\nOf images divine,\nPerdition seize his vain imaginings,\nIf, urged by greed profane,\nHe grasps at ill-got gain,\nAnd lays an impious hand on holiest things.\nWho when such deeds are done\nCan hope heaven’s bolts to shun?\nIf sin like this to honor can aspire,\nWhy dance I still and lead the sacred choir?\n(Ant. 2)\nNo more I’ll seek earth’s central oracle,\nOr Abae’s hallowed cell,\nNor to Olympia bring\nMy votive offering.\nIf before all God’s truth be not bade plain.\nO Zeus, reveal thy might,\nKing, if thou’rt named aright\nOmnipotent, all-seeing, as of old;\nFor Laius is forgot;\nHis weird, men heed it not;\nApollo is forsook and faith grows cold.\n[Enter JOCASTA.]\nJOCASTA.\nMy lords, ye look amazed to see your queen\nWith wreaths and gifts of incense in her hands.\nI had a mind to visit the high shrines,\nFor Oedipus is overwrought, alarmed\nWith terrors manifold.

    "content":"PHILOCTETES\nTHE PERSONS\nODYSSEUS.\nNEOPTOLEMUS.\nCHORUS of Mariners.\nPHILOCTETES.\nMessenger, disguised as a Merchantman.\nHERACLES, appearing from the sky.\nSCENE. A desert shore of the Island of Lemnos.\n[page 216]It was fated that Troy should be taken by Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, assisted by the bow of Heracles in the hands of Philoctetes.\nNow Philoctetes had been rejected by the army because of a trouble in his foot, which made his presence with them insufferable; and had been cast away by Odysseus on the island of Lemnos.\nBut when the decree of fate was revealed by prophecy, Odysseus undertook to bring Philoctetes back, and took with him Neoptolemus, whose ambition could only be gratified through the return of Philoctetes with the bow.\nPhiloctetes was resolutely set against returning, and at the opening of the drama Neoptolemus is persuaded by Odysseus to take him with guile.\nBut when Philoctetes appears, the youth’s ingenuous nature is so wrought upon through pity and remorse, that his sympathy and native truthfulness at length overcome his ambition.\nWhen the inward sacrifice is complete, Heracles appears from heaven, and by a few words changes the mind of Philoctetes, so that all ends well.\n[page 217]\nPHILOCTETES\nODYSSEUS. NEOPTOLEMUS.\nODYSSEUS. This coast of sea-girt Lemnos, where we stand,\nIs uninhabited, untrodden of men.\nAnd here, O noble son of noblest sire,\nAchilles-born Neoptolemus, I erewhile,—\nOrdered by those who had command,—cast forth\nTrachinian Philoctetes, Poeas’ son,\nHis foot dark-dripping with a rankling wound;\nWhen with wild cries, that frighted holy rest,\nFilling the camp, he troubled every rite,\nThat none might handle sacrifice, or pour\nWine-offering, but his noise disturbed our peace.\nBut why these words? No moment this for talk,\nLest he discern my coming, and I lose\nThe scheme, wherewith I think to catch him soon.\nNow most behoves thy service, to explore\nThis headland for a cave with double mouth,\nWhose twofold aperture, on wintry days,\nGives choice of sunshine, and in summer noons\nThe breeze wafts slumber through the airy cell.\nThen, something lower down, upon the left,\nUnless ’tis dried, thine eye may note a spring.\nGo near now silently, and make me know\nIf still he persevere, and hold this spot,\nOr have roamed elsewhere, that informed of this\nI may proceed with what remains to say,\nAnd we may act in concert.\nNEOPTOLEMUS. Lord Odysseus,\nThy foremost errand will not task me far.\nMethinks I see the cave whereof thou speakest.\nOD. Where? let me see it. Above there, or below?\n[page 218][29-64]\nNEO. Yonder, above. And yet I hear no tread.\n[NEOPTOLEMUS climbs up to the cave\nOD. Look if he be not lodged in slumber there.\nNEO. I find no inmate, but an empty room.\nOD. What? no provision for a dwelling-place?\nNEO. A bed of leaves for some one harbouring here.\nOD. Nought else beneath the roof? Is all forlorn?\nNEO. A cup of wood, some untaught craftsman’s skill,\nAnd, close at hand, these embers of a fire.\nOD. That store is his. I read the token clear.\nNEO. Oh! and these festering rags give evidence,\nSteeped as with dressing some malignant sore.\nOD. The man inhabits here: I know it now.\nAnd sure he’s not far off. How can he range,\nWhose limb drags heavy with an ancient harm?\nBut he’s gone, either to bring forage home,\nOr where he hath found some plant of healing power.\nSend therefore thine attendant to look forth,\nLest unawares he find me. All our host\nWere not so fair a prize for him as I.\nNEO. My man is going, and shall watch the path.\nWhat more dost thou require of me? Speak on.\nOD. Son of Achilles, know that thou art come\nTo serve us nobly, not with strength alone,\nBut, faithful to thy mission, if so be,\nTo do things strange, unwonted to thine ear.\nNEO. What dost thou bid me?\nOD. ’Tis thy duty now\nTo entrap the mind of Poeas’ son with words.\nWhen he shall ask thee, who and whence thou art,\nDeclare thy name and father. ’Tis not that\nI charge thee to conceal. But for thy voyage,\n’Tis homeward, leaving the Achaean host,\nWith perfect hatred hating them, because\nThey who had drawn thee with strong prayers from home,\nTheir hope for taking Troy, allowed thee not\nThy just demand to have thy father’s arms,\nBut, e’er thy coming, wrongly gave them o’er\n[page 219][64-101]Unto Odysseus: and thereon launch forth\nWith boundless execration against me.\nThat will not pain me, but if thou reject\nThis counsel, thou wilt trouble all our host,\nSince, if his bow shall not be ta’en, thy life\nWill ne’er be crowned through Troy’s discomfiture.\nNow let me show, why thine approach to him\nIs safe and trustful as mine cannot be\nThou didst sail forth, not to redeem thine oath,\nNor by constraint, nor with the foremost band.\nAll which reproaches I must bear: and he,\nBut seeing me, while master of his bow,\nWill slay me, and my ruin will be thine.\nThis point then craves our cunning, to acquire\nBy subtle means the irresistible bow—\nThy nature was not framed, I know it well,\nFor speaking falsehood, or contriving harm.\nYet, since the prize of victory is so dear,\nEndure it—We’ll be just another day\nBut now, for one brief hour, devote thyself\nTo serve me without shame, and then for aye\nHereafter be the pearl of righteousness.\nNEO. The thing that, being named, revolts mine ear,\nSon of Laërtes, I abhor to do\n’Tis not my nature, no, nor, as they tell,\nMy father’s, to work aught by craft and guile.\nI’ll undertake to bring him in by force,\nNot by deceit. For, sure, with his one foot,\nHe cannot be a match for all our crew\nBeing sent, my lord, to serve thee, I am loth\nTo seem rebellious. But I rather choose\nTo offend with honour, than to win by wrong.\nOD. Son of a valiant sire, I, too, in youth,\nHad once a slow tongue and an active hand.\nBut since I have proved the world, I clearly see\nWords and not deeds give mastery over men.\nNEO. What then is thy command? To lie? No more?\nOD. To entangle Philoctetes with deceit.\n[page 210][102-134]NEO. Why through deceit? May not persuasion fetch him?\nOD. Never. And force as certainly will fail.\nNEO. What lends him such assurance of defence?\nOD. Arrows, the unerring harbingers of Death.\nNEO. Then to go near him is a perilous thing.\nOD. Unless with subtlety, as I have said.\nNEO. And is not lying shameful to thy soul?\nOD. Not if by lying I can save my soul.\nNEO. How must one look in speaking such a word?\nOD. Where gain invites, this shrinking is not good.\nNEO. What gain I through his coming back to Troy?\nOD. His arms alone have power to take Troy-town.\nNEO. Then am not I the spoiler, as ye said?\nOD. Thou without them, they without thee, are powerless.\nNEO. If it be so, they must be sought and won.\nOD. Yea, for in this two prizes will be thine.\nNEO. What? When I learn them, I will not refuse.\nOD. Wisdom and valour joined in one good name.\nNEO. Shame, to the winds! Come, I will do this thing.\nOD. Say, dost thou bear my bidding full in mind?\nNEO. Doubt not, since once for all I have embraced it.\nOD. Thou, then, await him here. I will retire,\nFor fear my hated presence should be known,\nAnd take back our attendant to the ship.\nAnd then once more, should ye appear to waste\nThe time unduly, I will send again\nThis same man hither in disguise, transformed\nTo the strange semblance of a merchantman;\nFrom dark suggestion of whose crafty tongue,\nThou, O my son, shalt gather timely counsel.\nNow to my ship. This charge I leave to thee.\nMay secret Hermes guide us to our end,\nAnd civic Pallas, named of victory,\nThe sure protectress of my devious way.\n[page 221][135-162]\nCHORUS (entering).\nStrange in the stranger land,I 1\nWhat shall I speak? What hide\nFrom a heart suspicious of ill?\nTell me, O master mine!\nWise above all is the man,\nPeerless in searching thought,\nWho with the Zeus-given wand\nWieldeth a Heaven-sent power.\nThis unto thee, dear son,\nFraught with ancestral might,\nThis to thy life hath come.\nWherefore I bid thee declare,\nWhat must I do for thy need?\nNEO. Even now methinks thou longest to espy\nNear ocean’s marge the place where he doth lie.\nGaze without fear. But when the traveller stern,\nWho from this roof is parted, shall return,\nAdvancing still as I the signal give,\nTo serve each moment’s mission thou shalt strive.\nCH. That, O my son, from of oldI 2\nHath been my care, to take note\nWhat by thy beck’ning is told;\nStill thy success to promote.\nBut for our errand to-day\nBehoves thee, master, to say\nWhere is the hearth of his home;\nOr where even now doth he roam?\nO tell me, lest all unaware\nHe spring like a wolf from his lair\nAnd I by surprise should be ta’en,\nWhere doth he move or remain,\nHere lodging, or wandering away?\nNEO. Thou seëst yon double doorway of his cell,\nPoor habitation of the rock.\nCH. 2. But tell\nWhere is the pain-worn wight himself abroad?\nNEO. To me ’tis clear, that, in his quest for food,\n[page 222][163-204]Here, not far off, he trails yon furrowed path.\nFor, so ’tis told, this mode the sufferer hath\nOf sustenance, oh hardness! bringing low\nWild creatures with wing’d arrows from his bow;\nNor findeth healer for his troublous woe.\nCH. I feel his misery.II 1\nWith no companion eye,\nFar from all human care,\nHe pines with fell disease;\nEach want he hourly sees\nAwakening new despair.\nHow can he bear it still?\nO cruel Heavens! O pain\nOf that afflicted mortal train\nWhose life sharp sorrows fill!\nBorn in a princely hall,II 2\nHighest, perchance, of all,\nNow lies he comfortless\nAlone in deep distress,\n’Mongst rough and dappled brutes,\nWith pangs and hunger worn;\nWhile from far distance shoots,\nOn airy pinion borne,\nThe unbridled Echo, still replying\nTo his most bitter crying.\nNEO. At nought of this I marvel—for if I\nJudge rightly, there assailed him from on high\nThat former plague through Chrysa’s cruel sting:\nAnd if to-day he suffer anything\nWith none to soothe, it must be from the will\nOf some great God, so caring to fulfil\nThe word of prophecy, lest he should bend\nOn Troy the shaft no mortal may forfend,\nBefore the arrival of Troy’s destined hour,\nWhen she must fall, o’er-mastered by their power.\nCH. 1. Hush, my son!III 1\nNEO. Why so?\nCH. 1. A sound\nGendered of some mortal woe,\n[page 223][205-237]Started from the neighbouring ground.\nHere, or there? Ah! now I know.\nHark! ’tis the voice of one in pain,\nTravelling hardly, the deep strain\nOf human anguish, all too clear,\nThat smites my heart, that wounds mine ear.\nCH. 2. From far it peals. But thou, my son!III 2\nNEO. What?\nCH. 2. Think again. He moveth nigh:\nHe holds the region: not with tone\nOf piping shepherd’s rural minstrelsy,\nBut belloweth his far cry,\nStumbling perchance with mortal pain,\nOr else in wild amaze,\nAs he our ship surveys\nUnwonted on the inhospitable main.\nEnter PHILOCTETES.\nPHILOCTETES. Ho!\nWhat men are ye that to this desert shore,\nHarbourless, uninhabited, are come\nOn shipboard? Of what country or what race\nShall I pronounce ye? For your outward garb\nIs Grecian, ever dearest to this heart\nThat hungers now to hear your voices’ tune.\nAh! do not fear me, do not shrink away\nFrom my wild looks: but, pitying one so poor,\nForlorn and desolate in nameless woe,\nSpeak, if with friendly purpose ye are come.\nOh answer! ’Tis not meet that I should lose\nThis kindness from your lips, or ye from mine.\nNEO. Then know this first, O stranger, as thou wouldest,\nThat we are Greeks.\nPHI. O dear, dear name! Ah me!\nIn all these years, once, only once, I hear it!\nMy son, what fairest gale hath wafted thee?\nWhat need hath brought thee to the shore? What mission?\n[page 224][238-273]Declare all this, that I may know thee well.\nNEO. The sea-girt Scyros is my native home.\nThitherward I make voyage:—Achilles’ son,\nNamed Neoptolemus.—I have told thee all.\nPHI. Dear is that shore to me, dear is thy father\nO ancient Lycomedes’ foster-child,\nWhence cam’st thou hither? How didst thou set forth?\nNEO. From Troy we made our course in sailing hither.\nPHI. How? Sure thou wast not with us, when at first\nWe launched our vessels on the Troyward way?\nNEO. Hadst thou a share in that adventurous toil?\nPHI. And know’st thou not whom thou behold’st in me,\nYoung boy?\nNEO. How should I know him whom I ne’er\nSet eye on?\nPHI. Hast not even heard my name,\nNor echoing rumour of my ruinous woe?\nNEO. Nay, I know nought of all thy questioning.\nPHI. How full of griefs am I, how Heaven-abhorred,\nWhen of my piteous state no faintest sound\nHath reached my home, or any Grecian land!\nBut they, who pitilessly cast me forth,\nKeep silence and are glad, while this my plague\nBlooms ever, and is strengthened more and more.\nBoy, great Achilles’ offspring, in this form\nThou seest the man, of whom, methinks, erewhile\nThou hast been told, to whom the Hercúlean bow\nDescended, Philoctetes, Poeas’ son;\nWhom the two generals and the Ithacan king\nCast out thus shamefully forlorn, afflicted\nWith the fierce malady and desperate wound\nMade by the cruel basilisk’s murderous tooth.\nWith this for company they left me, child!\nExposed upon this shore, deserted, lone.\nFrom seaward Chrysa came they with their fleet\nAnd touched at Lemnos. I had fallen to rest\nFrom the long tossing, in a shadowy cave\nOn yonder cliff by the shore. Gladly they saw,\nAnd left me, having set forth for my need,\n[page 225][273-314]Poor man, some scanty rags, and a thin store\nOf provender. Such food be theirs, I pray!\nImagine, O my son, when they were gone,\nWhat wakening, what arising, then was mine;\nWhat weeping, what lamenting of my woe!\nWhen I beheld the ships, wherewith I sailed,\nGone, one and all! and no man in the place,\nNone to bestead me, none to comfort me\nIn my sore sickness. And where’er I looked,\nNought but distress was present with me still.\nNo lack of that, for one thing!—Ah! my son,\nTime passed, and there I found myself alone\nWithin my narrow lodging, forced to serve\nEach pressing need. For body’s sustenance\nThis bow supplied me with sufficient store,\nWounding the feathered doves, and when the shaft,\nFrom the tight string, had struck, myself, ay me!\nDragging this foot, would crawl to my swift prey.\nThen water must be fetched, and in sharp frost\nWood must be found and broken,—all by me.\nNor would fire come unbidden, but with flint\nFrom flints striking dim sparks, I hammered forth\nThe struggling flame that keeps the life in me.\nFor houseroom with the single help of fire\nGives all I need, save healing for my sore.\nNow learn, my son, the nature of this isle.\nNo mariner puts in here willingly.\nFor it hath neither moorage, nor sea-port,\nFor traffic or kind shelter or good cheer.\nNot hitherward do prudent men make voyage.\nPerchance one may have touched against his will.\nMany strange things may happen in long time.\nThese, when they come, in words have pitied me,\nAnd given me food, or raiment, in compassion.\nBut none is willing, when I speak thereof,\nTo take me safely home. Wherefore I pine\nNow this tenth year, in famine and distress,\nFeeding the hunger of my ravenous plague.\nSuch deeds, my son, the Atridae, and the might\nOf sage Odysseus, have performed on me.\n[page 226][315-349]Wherefore may all the Olympian gods, one day,\nPlague them with stern requital for my wrong!\nCH. Methinks my feeling for thee, Poeas’ child,\nIs like that of thy former visitants.\nNEO. I, too, a witness to confirm his words,\nKnow them for verities, since I have found\nThe Atridae and Odysseus evil men.\nPHI. Art thou, too, wroth with the all-pestilent sons\nOf Atreus? Have they given thee cause to grieve?\nNEO. Would that my hand might ease the wrath I feel!\nThen Sparta and Mycenae should be ware\nThat Scyros too breeds valiant sons for war.\nPHI. Brave youth! I love thee. Tell me the great cause\nWhy thou inveighest against them with such heat?\nNEO. O son of Poeas, hardly shall I tell\nWhat outrage I endured when I had come;\nYet I will speak it. When the fate of death\nO’ertook Achilles—\nPHI. Out, alas! no more!\nHold, till thou first hast made me clearly know,\nIs Peleus’ offspring dead?\nNEO. Alas! he is,\nSlain by no mortal, felled by Phoebus’ shaft:\nSo men reported—\nPHI. Well, right princely was he!\nAnd princely is he who slew him. Shall I mourn\nHim first, or wait till I have heard thy tale?\nNEO. Methinks thou hast thyself enough to mourn,\nWithout the burden of another’s woe.\nPHI. Well spoken. Then renew thine own complaint,\nAnd tell once more wherein they insulted thee.\nNEO. There came to fetch me, in a gallant ship,\nOdysseus and the fosterer of my sire,\nSaying, whether soothly, or in idle show,\nThat, since my father perished, it was known\nNone else but I should take Troy’s citadel.\nSuch words from them, my friend, thou may’st believe,\nHeld me not long from making voyage with speed,\n[page 227][350-385]Chiefly through longing for my father’s corse,\nTo see him yet unburied,—for I ne’er\nHad seen him. Then, besides, ’twas a fair cause,\nIf, by my going, I should vanquish Troy.\nOne day I had sailed, and on the second came\nTo sad Sigeum with wind-favoured speed,\nWhen straightway all the host, surrounding me\nAs I set foot on shore, saluted me,\nAnd swore the dead Achilles was in life,\nTheir eyes being witness, when they looked on me.\nHe lay there in his shroud: but I, unhappy,\nSoon ending lamentation for the dead,\nWent near to those Atridae, as to friends,\nTo obtain my father’s armour and all else\nThat had been his. And then,—alas the while,\nThat men should be so hard!—they spake this word:\n‘Seed of Achilles, thou may’st freely take\nAll else thy father owned, but for those arms,\nAnother wields them now, Laërtes’ son.’\nTears rushed into mine eyes, and in hot wrath\nI straightway rose, and bitterly outspake:\n‘O miscreant! What? And have ye dared to give\nMine arms to some man else, unknown to me?’\nThen said Odysseus, for he chanced to be near,\n‘Yea, child, and justly have they given me these.\nI saved them and their master in the field.’\nThen in fierce anger all at once I launched\nAll terms of execration at his head,\nBating no word, being maddened by the thought\nThat I should lose this heirloom,—and to him!\nHe, at this pass, though not of wrathful mood,\nStung by such utterance, made rejoinder thus:\n‘Thou wast not with us here, but wrongfully\nDidst bide afar. And, since thou mak’st so bold,\nI tell thee, never shalt thou, as thou sayest,\nSail with these arms to Scyros.’—Thus reviled,\nWith such an evil echo in mine ear,\nI voyage homeward, robbed of mine own right\nBy that vile offset of an evil tree.\nYet less I blame him than the men in power.\n[page 228][386-423]For every multitude, be it army or state,\nTakes tone from those who rule it, and all taint\nOf disobedience from bad counsel springs.\nI have spoken. May the Atridae’s enemy\nBe dear to Heaven, as he is loved by me!\nCH. Mother of mightiest Zeus,1\nFeeder of all that live,\nWho from thy mountainous breast\nRivers of gold dost give!\nTo thee, O Earth, I cried that shameful day,\nWhen insolence from Atreus’ sons went forth\nFull on our lord: when they bestowed away\nHis father’s arms to crown Odysseus’ worth;\nThou, whom bull-slaughtering lions yoked bear,\nO mighty mother, hear!\nPHI. Your coming is commended by a grief\nThat makes you kindly welcome. For I feel\nA chord that vibrates to your voice, and tells,\nThus have Odysseus and the Atridae wrought.\nFull well I know, Odysseus’ poisoned tongue\nShrinks from no mischief nor no guileful word\nThat leads to bad achievement in the end.\nThis moves not my main marvel, but if one\nSaw this and bore it,—Aias of the shield.\nNEO. Ah, friend, he was no more. Had he but lived,\nThis robbery had ne’er been wrought on me.\nPHI. What? Is he too departed?\nNEO. He is dead.\nThe light no more beholds him.\nPHI. Oh! alas!\nBut Tydeus’ offspring, and the rascal birth\nLaërtes bought of Sisyphus, they live:\nI know it. For their death were to be wished.\nNEO. Yea, be assured, they live and flourish high\nExalted in the host of Argive men.\nPHI. And Nestor, my old friend, good aged man,\nIs he yet living? Oft he would prevent\nTheir evils, by the wisdom of his thought.\n[page 229][424-461]NEO. He too is now in trouble, having lost\nAntilochus, the comfort of his age.\nPHI. There, there! In one brief word thou hast revealed\nThe mournful case of twain, whom I would last\nHave chosen to hear of as undone. Ah me!\nWhere must one look? when these are dead, and he,\nOdysseus, lives,—and in a time like this,\nThat craves their presence, and his death for theirs.\nNEO. He wrestles cleverly; but, O my friend,\nEven ablest wits are ofttimes snared at last.\nPHI. Tell me, I pray, what was become of him,\nPatroclus, whom thy father loved so well?\nNEO. He, too, was gone. I’ll teach thee in a word\nOne truth for all. War doth not willingly\nSnatch off the wicked, but still takes the good.\nPHI. True! and to prove thy saying, I will inquire\nThe fate of a poor dastard, of mean worth,\nBut ever shrewd and nimble with his tongue.\nNEO. Whom but Odysseus canst thou mean by this?\nPHI. I meant not him. But there was one Thersites,\nWho ne’er made conscience to stint speech, where all\nCried ‘Silence!’ Is he living, dost thou know?\nNEO. I saw him not, but knew he was alive.\nPHI. He must be: for no evil yet was crushed.\nThe Heavens will ever shield it. ’Tis their sport\nTo turn back all things rancorous and malign\nFrom going down to the grave, and send instead\nThe good and true. Oh, how shall we commend\nSuch dealings, how defend them? When I praise\nThings god-like, I find evil in the Gods.\nNEO. I, O thou child of a Trachinian sire,\nHenceforth will take good care, from far away\nTo look on Troy and Atreus’ children twain.\nYea, where the trickster lords it o’er the just,\nAnd goodness languishes and rascals rule,\n—Such courses I will nevermore endure.\nBut rock-bound Scyros henceforth shall suffice\nTo yield me full contentment in my home.\nNow, to my vessel! And thou, Poeas’ child,\n[page 230][462-499]Farewell, right heartily farewell! May Heaven\nGrant thy desire, and rid thee of thy plague!\nLet us be going, that when God shall give\nFair voyage, that moment we may launch away.\nPHI. My son, are ye now setting forth?\nNEO. Our time\nBids us go near and look to sail erelong.\nPHI. Now, by thy father, by thy mother,—nay,\nBy all thy love e’er cherished in thy home,\nSuppliant I beg thee, leave me not thus lone,\nForlorn in all my misery which thou seest,\nIn all thou hast heard of here surrounding me!\nStow me with other freightage. Full of care,\nI know, and burdensome the charge may prove.\nYet venture! Surely to the noble mind\nAll shame is hateful and all kindness blest.\nAnd shame would be thy meed, didst thou fail here\nBut, doing this, thou shalt have glorious fame,\nWhen I return alive to Oeta’s vale.\nCome, ’tis the labour not of one whole day.\nSo thou durst take me, fling me where thou wilt\nO’ the ship, in hold, prow, stern, or wheresoe’er\nI least may trouble those on board with me.\nAh! by great Zeus, the suppliant’s friend, comply,\nMy son, be softened! See, where I am fall’n\nThus on my knees before thee, though so weak,\nCrippled and powerless. Ah! forsake me not\nThus far from human footstep. Take me, take me!\nIf only to thy home, or to the town\nOf old Chalcodon in Euboea.—From thence\nI have not far to Oeta, and the ridge\nOf Trachis, and Spercheius’ lordly flood.\nSo thou shalt bless my father with my sight.\nAnd yet long since I fear he may be gone.\nFor oft I sent him suppliant prayers by men\nWho touched this isle, entreating him to fetch\nAnd bear me safely home with his own crew.\nBut either he is dead, or else, methinks,\nIt well may be, my messengers made light\nOf my concerns, and hastened onward home.\n[page 231][500-536]But now in thee I find both messenger\nAnd convoy, thou wilt pity me and save.\nFor, well thou knowest, danger never sleeps,\nAnd fear of dark reverse is always nigh.\nMortals, when free, should look where mischief lurks,\nAnd in their happiest hour consider well\nTheir life, lest ruin unsuspected come.\nCH. Pity him, O my king!2\nMany a crushing woe\nHe telleth, such as I pray\nNone of my friends may know.\nAnd if, dear master, thou mislikest sore\nYon cruel-hearted lordly pair, I would,\nTurning their plan of evil to his good,\nOn swift ship bear him to his native shore,\nMeeting his heart’s desire; and free thy path\nFrom fear of heavenly wrath.\nNEO. Thou mak’st small scruple here; but be advised:\nLest, when this plague on board shall weary thee,\nThy voice should alter from this liberal tone.\nCH. No, truly! Fear not thou shalt ever have\nJust cause to utter such reproach on me.\nNEO. Then sure ’twere shame, should I more backward prove\nThan thou, to labour for the stranger’s need.\nCome, if thou wilt, let us make voyage, and he,\nLet him set forth with speed. Our ship shall take him.\nHe shall not be refused. Only may Heaven\nLead safely hence and to our destined port!\nPHI. O morning full of brightness! Kindest friend,\nSweet mariners, how can I make you feel,\nIn act, how dearly from my heart I love you!\nYe have won my soul. Let us be gone, my son,—\nFirst having said farewell to this poor cave,\nMy homeless dwelling-place, that thou may’st know,\nHow barely I have lived, how firm my heart!\nMethinks another could not have endured\n[page 232][537-572]The very sight of what I bore. But I\nThrough strong necessity have conquered pain.\nCH. Stay: let us understand. There come two men\nA stranger, with a shipmate of thy crew.\nWhen ye have heard them, ye may then go in.\nEnter Messenger, disguised as a merchantman.\nMERCHANTMAN. Son of Achilles, my companion here,\nWho with two more remained to guard thy ship,\nAgreed to help me find thee where thou wert,\nSince unexpectedly, through fortune’s will,\nI meet thee, mooring by the self-same shore.\nFor like a merchantman, with no great sail,\nMaking my course from Ilion to my home,\nGrape-clustered Peparethos, when I heard\nThe mariners declare that one and all\nWere of thy crew, I would not launch again,\nWithout a word, till we had told our news.—\nMethinks thou knowest nought of thine own case,\nWhat new devices of the Argive chiefs\nSurround thee; nor devices only now,\nBut active deeds, no longer unperformed.\nNEO. Well, stranger, for the kindness thou hast shown,—\nElse were I base,—my heart must thank thee still.\nBut tell me what thou meanest, that I may learn\nWhat new-laid plot thou bring’st me from the camp.\nMER. Old Phoenix, Acamas and Demophon\nAre gone in thy pursuit with ships and men.\nNEO. To bring me back with reasons or perforce?\nMER. I know not. What I heard, I am here to tell.\nNEO. How? And is this in act? Are they set forth\nTo please the Atridae, Phoenix and the rest?\nMER. The thing is not to do, but doing now.\nNEO. What kept Odysseus back, if this be so,\nFrom going himself? Had he some cause for fear?\nMER. He and the son of Tydeus, when our ship\nHoist sail, were gone to fetch another man.\nNEO. For whom could he himself be sailing forth?\n[page 233][573-607]MER. For some one,—but first tell me, whispering low\nWhate’er thou speakest,—who is this I see?\nNEO. (speaking aloud).\nThis, sir, is Philoctetes the renowned.\nMER. (aside to NEOPTOLEMUS).\nWithout more question, snatch thyself away\nAnd sail forth from this land.\nPHI. What saith he, boy?\nThrough what dark traffic is the mariner\nBetraying me with whispering in thine ear?\nNEO. I have not caught it, but whate’er he speaks\nHe must speak openly to us and thee.\nMER. Seed of Achilles, let me not offend\nThe army by my words! Full many a boon,\nBeing poor, I reap from them for service done.\nNEO. The Atridae are my foes; the man you see\nIs my fast friend, because he hates them sore.\nThen, if you come in kindness, you must hide\nNothing from him or me of all thou hast heard.\nMER. Look what thou doest, my son!\nNEO. I mark it well.\nMER. Thou shalt be answerable.\nNEO. Content: but speak.\nMER. Then hear me. These two men whom I have named,\nDiomedes and Odysseus, are set forth\nEngaged on oath to bring this man by force\nIf reasons fail. The Achaeans every one\nHave heard this plainly from Odysseus’ mouth.\nHe was the louder and more confident.\nNEO. Say, for what cause, after so long a time,\nCan Atreus’ sons have turned their thoughts on him,\nWhom long they had cast forth? What passing touch\nOf conscience moved them, or what stroke from Heaven,\nWhose wrath requites all wicked deeds of men?\nMER. Methinks thou hast not heard what I will now\nUnfold to thee. There was a princely seer,\nA son of Priam, Helenus by name,\nWhom he for whom no word is bad enough,\n[page 234][608-645]Crafty Odysseus, sallying forth alone\nOne night, had taken, and in bonds displayed\n‘Fore all the Achaeans, a right noble prey.\nHe, ’mid his other prophecies, foretold\nNo Grecian force should sack Troy’s citadel,\nTill with fair reasons they had brought this man\nFrom Lemnos isle, his lonely dwelling-place.\nWhen thus the prophet spake, Laërtes’ son\nStraight undertook to fetch this man, and show him\nTo all the camp:—he hoped, with fair consent:\nBut else, perforce.—And, if he failed in this,\nWhoever would might smite him on the head.\nMy tale is told, dear youth. I counsel speed\nTo thee and to the friend for whom thou carest.\nPHI. Ah me, unhappy! has that rascal knave\nSworn to fetch me with reasons to their camp?\nAs likely might his reasons bring me back,\nLike his begetter, from the house of death.\nMER. You talk of what I know not. I will go\nShipward. May God be with you for all good.[Exit\nPHI. Is not this terrible, Laërtes’ son\nShould ever think to bring me with soft words\nAnd show me from his deck to all their host?\nNo! Sooner will I listen to the tongue\nOf the curs’d basilisk that thus hath maim’d me.\nAy, but he’ll venture anything in word\nOr deed. And now I know he will be here.\nCome, O my son, let us be gone, while seas\nAnd winds divide us from Odysseus’ ship.\nLet us depart. Sure timely haste brings rest\nAnd quiet slumber when the toil is done.\nNEO. Shall we not sail when this south-western wind\nHath fallen, that now is adverse to our course?\nPHI. All winds are fair to him who flies from woe.\nNEO. Nay, but this head-wind hinders them no less.\nPHI. No head-wind hinders pirates on their way,\nWhen violence and rapine lead them on.\nNEO. Well, then, let us be going, if you will;\n[page 235][646-675]When you have taken from within the cave\nWhat most you need and value.\nPHI. Though my all\nBe little, there is that I may not lose.\nNEO. What can there be that we have not on board?\nPHI. A leaf I have found, wherewith I still the rage\nOf my sore plague, and lull it quite to rest.\nNEO. Well, bring it forth.—What? Is there something more?\nPHI. If any of these arrows here are fallen,\nI would not leave them for a casual prey.\nNEO. How? Do I see thee with the marvellous bow?\nPHI. Here in my hand. The world hath only one.\nNEO. And may one touch and handle it, and gaze\nWith reverence, as on a thing from Heaven?\nPHI. Thou mayest, my son. This and whate’er of mine\nMay stead thee, ’tis thy privilege to enjoy.\nNEO. In very truth I long for it, but so,\nThat longing waits on leave. Am I permitted?\nPHI. Thou art, my son,—and well thou speakest,—thou art.\nThou, that hast given me light and life, the joy\nOf seeing Mount Oeta and my father’s home,\nWith all I love there, and his aged head,—\nThou that hast raised me far above my foes\nWho triumphed! Thou may’st take it in thine hand,\nAnd,—when thou hast given it back to me,—may’st vaunt\nAlone of mortals for thine excellence\nTo have held this in thy touch. I, too, at first,\nReceived it as a boon for kindness done.\nNEO. Well, go within.\nPHI. Nay, I must take thee too.\nMy sickness craves thee for its comforter.\n[PHILOCTETES and NEOPTOLEMUS go into the cave\n[page 236][676-711]\nCHORUS.\nIn fable I have heard,I 1\nThough sight hath ne’er confirmed the word,\nHow he who attempted once the couch supreme,\nTo a whirling wheel by Zeus the all-ruler bound,\nTied head and heel, careering ever round,\nAtones his impious unsubstantial dream.\nOf no man else, through eye or ear,\nHave I discerned a fate more full of fear\nThan yonder sufferer’s of the cureless wound:\nWho did no violence, defrauded none:—\nA just man, had he dwelt among the just\nUnworthily behold him thrust\nAlone to hear the billows roar\nThat break around a rugged shore!\nHow could he live, whose life was thus consumed with moan?\nWhere neighbour there was none:I 2\nNo arm to stay him wandering lone,\nUnevenly, with stumbling steps and sore;\nNo friend in need, no kind inhabitant,\nTo minister to his importunate want,\nNo heart whereto his pangs he might deplore.\nNone who, whene’er the gory flow\nWas rushing hot, might healing herbs bestow,\nOr cull from teeming Earth some genial plant\nTo allay the anguish of malignant pain\nAnd soothe the sharpness of his poignant woe.\nLike infant whom the nurse lets go,\nWith tottering movement here and there,\nHe crawled for comfort, whensoe’er\nHis soul-devouring plague relaxed its cruel strain.\nNot fed with foison of all-teeming EarthII 1\nWhence we sustain us, ever-toiling men,\nBut only now and then\nWith wingèd things, by his wing’d shafts brought low,\nHe stayed his hunger from his bow.\n[page 237][712-749]Poor soul, that never through ten years of dearth\nHad pleasure from the fruitage of the vine,\nBut seeking to some standing pool,\nNor clear nor cool,\nFoul water heaved to head for lack of heartening wine.\nBut now, consorted with the hero’s child,II 2\nHe winneth greatness and a joyful change;\nOver the water wild\nBorne by a friendly bark beneath the range\nOf Oeta, where Spercheius fills\nWide channels winding among lovely hills\nHaunted of Melian nymphs, till he espies\nThe roof-tree of his father’s hall,\nAnd high o’er all\nShines the bronze shield of him, whose home is in the skies.\n[NEOPTOLEMUS comes out of the cave, followed by PHILOCTETES in pain\nNEO. Prithee, come on! Why dost thou stand aghast,\nVoiceless, and thus astonied in thine air?\nPHI. Oh! oh!\nNEO. What?\nPHI. Nothing. Come my son, fear nought.\nNEO. Is pain upon thee? Hath thy trouble come?\nPHI. No pain, no pain! ’Tis past; I am easy now.\nYe heavenly powers!\nNEO. Why dost thou groan aloud,\nAnd cry to Heaven?\nPHI. To come and save. Kind Heaven!\nOh, oh!\nNEO. What is ’t? Why silent? Wilt not speak?\nI see thy misery.\nPHI. Oh! I am lost, my son!\nI cannot hide it from you. Oh! it shoots,\nIt pierces. Oh unhappy! Oh! my woe!\nI am lost, my son, I am devoured. Oh me!\nOh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Pain! pain! Oh pain! oh pain!\nChild, if a sword be to thine hand, smite hard,\nShear off my foot! heed not my life! Quick, come!\n[page 238][751-786]NEO. What hath so suddenly arisen, that thus\nThou mak’st ado and groanest o’er thyself?\nPHI. Thou knowest.\nNEO. What know I?\nPHI. O! thou knowest, my son!\nNEO. I know not.\nPHI. How? Not know? Ah me! Pain, pain!\nNEO. Thy plague is a sore burden, heavy and sore.\nPHI. Sore? ’Tis unutterable. Have pity on me!\nNEO. What shall I do?\nPHI. Do not in fear forsake me.\nThis wandering evil comes in force again,\nHungry as ere it fed.\nNEO. O hapless one!\nThrice hapless in thy manifold distress!\nWhat wilt thou? Shall I raise thee on mine arm?\nPHI. Nay, but receiving from my hand the bow,\nAs late thou didst desire me, keep it safe\nAnd guard it, till the fury of my pain\nPass over me and cease. For when ’tis spent,\nSlumber will seize me, else it ne’er would end.\nI must sleep undisturbed. But if meanwhile\nThey come,—by Heaven I charge thee, in no wise,\nWillingly nor perforce, let them have this!\nElse thou wilt be the slayer of us both;\nOf me thy suppliant, and of thyself.\nNEO. Fear not my care. No hand shall hold these arms\nBut thine and mine. Give, and Heaven bless the deed!\nPHI. I give them; there, my son! But look to Heaven\nAnd pray no envy smite thee, nor such bane\nIn having them, as fell on me and him\nWho bore them formerly.\nNEO. O grant it, Gods!\nAnd grant us fair and happy voyage, where’er\nOur course is shaped and righteous Heaven shall guide.\nPHI. Ah! but I fear, my son, thy prayer is vain:\nFor welling yet again from depths within,\nThis gory ooze is dripping. It will come!\nI know it will. O, foot, torn helpless thing,\n[page 239][786-816]What wilt thou do to me? Ah! ah! It comes,\nIt is at hand. ’Tis here! Woe’s me, undone!\nI have shown you all. Stay near me. Go not far:\nAh! ah!\nO island king, I would this agony\nMight cleave thy bosom through and through! Woe, woe!\nWoe! Ah! ye two commanders of the host,\nAgamemnon, Menelaüs, O that ye,\nAnother ten years’ durance in my room\nMight nurse this malady! O Death, Death, Death!\nI call thee daily—wilt thou never come?\nWill it not be?—My son, thou noble boy,\nIf thou art noble, take and burn me there\nAloft in yon all-worshipped Lemnian fire!\nYea, when the bow thou keep’st was my reward,\nI did like service for the child of Heaven.\nHow now, my son?\nWhat say’st? Art silent? Where—where art thou, boy?\nNEO. My heart is full, and groaning o’er thy woes.\nPHI. Nay, yet have comfort. This affliction oft\nGoes no less swiftly than it came. I pray thee,\nStand fast and leave me not alone!\nNEO. Fear nought.\nWe will not stir.\nPHI. Wilt thou remain?\nNEO. Be sure of it.\nPHI. I’ll not degrade thee with an oath, my son.\nNEO. Rest satisfied. I may not go without thee.\nPHI. Thy hand, to pledge me that!\nNEO. There, I will stay.\nPHI. Now, now, aloft!\nNEO. Where mean’st thou?\nPHI. Yonder aloft!\nNEO. Whither? Thou rav’st. Why starest thou at the sky?\nPHI. Now, let me go.\nNEO. Where?\nPHI. Let me go, I say!\n[page 240][817-847]NEO. I will not.\nPHI. You will kill me. Let me go!\nNEO. Well, thou know’st best I hold thee not.\nPHI. O Earth,\nI die. receive me to thy breast! This pain\nSubdues me utterly, I cannot stand.\nNEO. Methinks he will be fast in slumber soon\nThat head sinks backward, and a clammy sweat\nBathes all his limbs, while from his foot hath burst\nA vein, dark bleeding. Let us leave him, friends,\nIn quietness, till he hath fallen to sleep.\nCHORUS\nLord of the happiest life,I\nSleep, thou that know’st not strife,\nThat know’st not grief,\nStill wafting sure relief,\nCome, saviour now!\nThy healing balm is spread\nOver this pain worn head,\nQuench not the beam that gives calm to his brow.\nLook, O my lord, to thy path,\nEither to go or to stay\nHow is my thought to proceed?\nWhat is our cause for delay?\nLook! Opportunity’s power,\nFitting the task to the hour,\nGiveth the race to the swift.\nNEO. He hears not. But I see that to have ta’en\nHis bow without him were a bootless gain\nHe must sail with us. So the god hath said\nHeaven hath decreed this garland for his head:\nAnd to have failed with falsehood were a meed\nOf shameful soilure for a shameless deed.\nCH. God shall determine the end—II\nBut for thine answer, friend,\nWaft soft words low!\nAll sick men’s sleep, we know,\n[page 241][848-879]Hath open eye;\nTheir quickly ruffling mind\nQuivers in lightest wind,\nSleepless in slumber new danger to spy.\nThink, O my lord, of thy path,\nSecretly look forth afar,\nWhat wilt thou do for thy need?\nHow with the wise wilt thou care?\nIf toward the nameless thy heart\nChooseth this merciful part,\nHuge are the dangers that drift.\nThe wind is fair, my son, the wind is fair,\nThe man is dark and helpless, stretched in night.\n(O kind, warm sleep that calmest human care!)\nPowerless of hand and foot and ear and sight,\nBlind, as one lying in the house of death.\n(Think well if here thou utterest timely breath.)\nThis, O my son, is all my thought can find,\nBest are the toils that without frightening bind.\nNEO. Hush! One word more were madness. He revives.\nHis eye hath motion. He uplifts his head.\nPHI. Fair daylight following sleep, and ye, dear friends,\nFaithful beyond all hope in tending me!\nI never could have dreamed that thou, dear youth,\nCouldst thus have borne my sufferings and stood near\nSo full of pity to relieve my pain.\nNot so the worthy generals of the host;—\nThis princely patience was not theirs to show.\nOnly thy noble nature, nobly sprung,\nMade light of all the trouble, though oppressed\nWith fetid odours and unceasing cries.\nAnd now, since this my plague would seem to yield\nSome pause and brief forgetfulness of pain,\nWith thine own hand, my son, upraise me here,\nAnd set me on my feet, that, when my strength\n[page 242][880-913]After exhaustion shall return again,\nWe may move shoreward and launch forth with speed.\nNEO. I feel unhoped-for gladness when I see\nThy painless gaze, and hear thy living breath,\nFor thine appearance and surroundings both\nWere deathlike. But arise! Or, if thou wilt,\nThese men shall raise thee. For they will not shrink\nFrom toil which thou and I at once enjoin.\nPHI. Right, right, my son! But lift me thine own self,\nAs I am sure thou meanest. Let these be,\nLest they be burdened with the noisome smell\nBefore the time. Enough for them to bear\nThe trouble on board.\nNEO. I will; stand up, endure!\nPHI. Fear not. Old habit will enable me.\nNEO. O me!\nWhat shall I do? Now ’tis my turn to exclaim!\nPHI. What canst thou mean? What change is here, my son?\nNEO. I know not how to shift the troublous word.\n’Tis hopeless.\nPHI. What is hopeless? Speak not so,\nDear child!\nNEO. But so my wretched lot hath fallen.\nPHI. Ah! Can it be, the offence of my disease\nHath moved thee not to take me now on board?\nNEO. All is offence to one who hath forced himself\nFrom the true bent to an unbecoming deed.\nPHI. Nought misbecoming to thyself or sire\nDoest thou or speak’st, befriending a good man.\nNEO. My baseness will appear. That wrings my soul.\nPHI. Not in thy deeds. But for thy words, I fear me!\nNEO. O Heaven! Must double vileness then be mine\nBoth shameful silence and most shameful speech?\nPHI. Or my discernment is at fault, or thou\nMean’st to betray me and make voyage without me.\nNEO. Nay, not without thee, there is my distress!\nLest I convey thee to thy bitter grief.\n[page 243][914-946]PHI. How? How, dear youth? I do not understand.\nNEO. Here I unveil it. Thou art to sail to Troy,\nTo join the chieftains and the Achaean host.\nPHI. What do I hear? Ah!\nNEO. Grieve not till you learn.\nPHI. Learn what? What wilt thou make of me? What mean’st thou?\nNEO. First to release thee from this plague, and then\nWith thee to go and take the realm of Troy.\nPHI. And is this thine intent?\nNEO. ’Tis so ordained\nUnchangeably. Be not dismayed! ’Tis so.\nPHI. Me miserable! I am betrayed, undone!\nWhat guile is here? My bow! give back my bow!\nNEO. I may not. Interest, and duty too,\nForce me to obey commandment.\nPHI. O thou fire,\nThou terror of the world! Dark instrument\nOf ever-hateful guile!—What hast thou done?\nHow thou hast cheated me! Art not ashamed\nTo look on him that sued to thee for shelter?\nO heart of stone, thou hast stolen my life away\nWith yonder bow!—Ah, yet I beg of thee,\nGive it me back, my son, I entreat thee, give!\nBy all thy father worshipped, rob me not\nOf life!—Ah me! Now he will speak no more,\nBut turns away, obdúrate to retain it.\nO ye, my comrades in this wilderness,\nRude creatures of the rocks, O promontories,\nCreeks, precipices of the hills, to you\nAnd your familiar presence I complain\nOf this foul trespass of Achilles’ son.\nSworn to convey me home, to Troy he bears me.\nAnd under pledge of his right hand hath ta’en\nAnd holds from me perforce my wondrous bow,\nThe sacred gift of Zeus-born Heracles,\nThinking to wave it midst the Achaean host\nTriumphantly for his. In conquering me\nHe vaunts as of some valorous feat, and knows not\nHe is spoiling a mere corse, an empty dream,\n[page 244][947-980]The shadow of a vapour. In my strength\nHe ne’er had vanquished me. Even as I am,\nHe could not, but by guile. Now, all forlorn,\nI am abused, deceived. What must I do?\nNay, give it me. Nay, yet be thy true self!\nThou art silent. I am lost. O misery!\nRude face of rock, back I return to thee\nAnd thy twin gateway, robbed of arms and food,\nTo wither in thy cave companionless:—\nNo more with these mine arrows to destroy\nOr flying bird or mountain-roving beast.\nBut, all unhappy! I myself must be\nThe feast of those on whom I fed, the chase\nOf that I hunted, and shall dearly pay\nIn bloody quittance for their death, through one\nWho seemed all ignorant of sinful guile.\nPerish,—not till I am certain if thy heart\nWill change once more,—if not, my curse on thee!\nCH. What shall we do, my lord? We wait thy word\nOr to sail now, or yield to his desire.\nNEO. My heart is pressed with a strange pity for him,\nNot now beginning, but long since begun.\nPHI. Ay, pity me, my son! by all above,\nMake not thy name a scorn by wronging me!\nNEO. O! I am troubled sore. What must I do?\nWould I had never left mine island home!\nPHI. Thou art not base, but seemest to have learnt\nSome baseness from base men. Now, as ’tis meet,\nBe better guided—leave me mine arms, and go.\nNEO. (to Chorus).\nWhat shall we do?\nEnter ODYSSEUS.\nODYSSEUS. What art thou doing, knave?\nGive me that bow, and haste thee back again.\nPHI. Alas! What do I hear? Odysseus’ voice?\nOD. Be sure of that, Odysseus, whom thou seest.\nPHI. Oh, I am bought and sold, undone! ’Twas he\nThat kidnapped me, and robbed me of my bow.\nOD. Yea. I deny it not. Be sure, ’twas I.\n[page 245][981-1015]PHI. Give back, my son, the bow; release it!\nOD. That,\nThough he desire it, he shall never do.\nThou too shalt march along, or these shall force thee.\nPHI. They force me! O thou boldest of bad men!\nThey force me?\nOD. If thou com’st not willingly.\nPHI. O Lemnian earth and thou almighty flame,\nHephaestos’ workmanship, shall this be borne,\nThat he by force must drag me from your care?\nOD. ’Tis Zeus, I tell thee, monarch of this isle,\nWho thus hath willed. I am his minister.\nPHI. Wretch, what vile words thy wit hath power to say!\nThe gods are liars when invoked by thee.\nOD. Nay, ’tis their truth compels thee to this voyage.\nPHI. I will not have it so.\nOD. I will. Thou shalt.\nPHI. Woe for my wretchedness! My father, then,\nBegat no freeman, but a slave in me.\nOD. Nay, but the peer of noblest men, with whom\nThou art to take and ravage Troy with might.\nPHI. Never,—though I must suffer direst woe,—\nWhile this steep Lemnian ground is mine to tread!\nOD. What now is thine intent?\nPHI. Down from the crag\nThis head shall plunge and stain the crag beneath.\nOD. (to the Attendants.)\nAy, seize and bind him. Baffle him in this.\nPHI. Poor hands, for lack of your beloved string,\nCaught by this craven! O corrupted soul!\nHow thou hast undermined me, having taken\nTo screen thy quest this youth to me unknown,\nFar worthier of my friendship than of thine,\nWho knew no better than to obey command.\nEven now ’tis manifest he burns within\nWith pain for his own error and my wrong.\nBut, though unwilling and mapt for ill,\nThy crafty, mean, and cranny spying soul\nToo well hath lessoned him in sinful lore.\n[page 246][1016-1052]Now thou hast bound me, O thou wretch, and thinkest\nTo take me from this coast, where thou didst cast me\nOutlawed and desolate, a corpse ’mongst men.\nOh!\nI curse thee now, as ofttimes in the past:\nBut since Heaven yields me nought but bitterness,\nThou livest and art blithe, while ’tis my pain\nTo live on in my misery, laughed to scorn\nBy thee and Atreus’ sons, those generals twain\nWhom thou art serving in this chase. But thou\nWith strong compulsion and deceit was driven\nTroyward, whilst I, poor victim, of free will\nTook my seven ships and sailed there, yet was thrown\nFar from all honour,—as thou sayest, by them,\nBut, as they turn the tale, by thee.—And now\nWhy fetch me hence and take me? To what end?\nI am nothing, dead to you this many a year.\nHow, O thou Heaven-abhorred! am I not now\nLame and of evil smell? how shall ye vaunt\nBefore the gods drink-offering or the fat\nOf victims, if I sail among your crew?\nFor this, as ye professed, was the chief cause\nWhy ye disowned me. Perish!—So ye shall,\nFor the wrong done me, if the Heavens be just.\nAnd that they are, I know. Else had ye ne’er\nSailed on this errand for an outcast wretch,\nHad they not pricked your heart with thoughts of me.\nOh, if ye pity me, chastising powers,\nAnd thou, the Genius of my land, revenge,\nRevenge this crime on all their heads at once!\nMy life is pitiable; but if I saw\nTheir ruin, I would think me well and strong.\nCH. How full of bitterness is his resolve,\nWrathfully spoken with unbending will!\nOD. I might speak long in answer, did the time\nGive scope, but now one thing is mine to say.\nI am known to vary with the varying need;\nAnd when ’tis tried, who can be just and good,\nMy peer will not be found for piety.\nBut though on all occasions covetous\n[page 247][1053-1092]Of victory, this once I yield to thee,\nAnd willingly. Unhand him there. Let go!\nLeave him to stay. What further use of thee,\nWhen we have ta’en these arms? Have we not Teucer,\nSkilled in this mystery? Yea, I may boast\nMyself thine equal both in strength and aim\nTo wield them. Fare thee well, then! Thou art free\nTo roam thy barren isle. We need thee not.\nLet us be going! And perchance thy gift\nMay bring thy destined glory to my brow.\nPHI. What shall I do? Alas, shalt thou be seen\nGraced with mine arms amongst Achaean men?\nOD. No more! I am going.\nPHI. O Achilles’ child!\nWilt thou, too, vanish? Must I lose thy voice?\nOD. Come on, and look not, noble though thou be,\nLest thou undo our fortune.\nPHI. Mariners,\nMust ye, too, leave me thus disconsolate?\nWill ye not pity me?\nCH. Our captain’s here.\nWhate’er he saith to thee, that we too speak.\nNEO. My chief will call me weakling, soft of heart;\nBut go not yet, since our friend bids you stay.\nTill we have prayed, and all be ready on board.\nMeanwhile, perchance, he may conceive some thought\nThat favours our design. We two will start;\nAnd ye, be swift to speed forth at our call.[Exit\nMONODY.\nPHI. O cavern of the hollow rock,I 1\nFrosty and stifling in the seasons’ change!\nHow I seem fated never more to range\nFrom thy sad covert, that hath felt the shock\nOf pain on pain, steeped with my wretchedness.\nNow thou wilt be my comforter in death!\nGrief haunted harbour, choked with my distress!\nTell me, what hope is mine of daily food,\nWho will be careful for my good?\n[page 248][1093-1132]I fail. Ye cowering creatures of the sky,\nOh, as ye fly,\nSnatch me, borne upward on the blast’s sharp breath!\nCH. 1. Thou child of misery!\nNo mightier power hath this decreed,\nBut thine own will and deed\nHath bound thee thus in grief,\nSince, when kind Heaven had sent relief\nAnd shown the path of wisdom firm and sure,\nThou still hast chosen this evil to endure.\nPHI. O hapless life, sore bruised with pain!I 2\nNo more with living mortal may I dwell,\nBut ever pining in this desert cell\nWith lonely grief, all famished must remain\nAnd perish; for what food is mine to share,\nWhen this strong arm no longer wields my bow,\nWhose fleet shafts flew to smite the birds of air\nI was o’erthrown by words, words dark and blind,\nLow-creeping from a traitorous mind!\nO might I see him, whose unrighteous thought\nThis ruin wrought,\nPlagued for no less a period with like woe!\nCH. 2. Not by our craft thou art caught,\nBut Destiny divine hath wrought\nThe net that holds thee bound.\nAim not at us the sound\nOf thy dread curse with dire disaster fraught.\nOn others let that light! ’Tis our true care\nThou should’st not scorn our love in thy despair.\nPHI. Now, seated by the shoreII 1\nOf heaving ocean hoar,\nHe mocks me, waving high\nThe sole support of my precarious being,\nThe bow which none e’er held but I.\nO treasure of my heart, torn from this hand,\nThat loved thy touch,—if thou canst understand,\nHow sad must be thy look in seeing\nThy master destined now no more,\nLike Heracles of yore,\n[page 249][1133-1168]To wield thee with an archer’s might!\nBut in the grasp of an all-scheming wight,\nO bitter change! thou art plied;\nAnd swaying ever by his side,\nShalt view his life of dark malignity,\nTeeming with guileful shames, like those he wrought on me.\nCH. 3. Nobly to speak for the right\nIs manly and strong;\nBut not with an envious blight\nTo envenom the tongue;\nHe to serve all his friends of the fleet,\nOne obeying a many-voiced word,\nThrough the minist’ring craft of our lord\nHath but done what was meet.\nPHI. Come, legions of the wild,II 2\nOf aspect fierce or mild,\nFowl from the fields of air,\nAnd beasts that roam with bright untroubled gaze,\nNo longer bounding from my lair\nFly mine approach! Now freely without fear\nYe may surround my covert and come near,\nTreading the savage rock-strewn ways.\nThe might I had is no more mine,\nStolen with those arms divine.\nThis fort hath no man to defend.\nCome satisfy your vengeful jaws, and rend\nThese quivering tainted limbs!\nAlready hovering death bedims\nMy fainting sense. Who thus can live on air,\nTasting no gift of earth that breathing mortals share?\nCH. 4. Ah! do not shrink from thy friend,\nIf love thou reverest,\nBut know ’tis for thee to forfend\nThe fate which thou fearest.\nThe lot thou hast here to deplore,\nIs sad evermore to maintain,\n[page 250][1169-1202]And hardship in sickness is sore,\nBut sorest in pain.\nPHI. Kindest of all that e’er beforeIII\nHave trod this shore,\nAgain thou mind’st me of mine ancient woe!\nWhy wilt thou ruin me? What wouldst thou do?\nCH. 5. How mean’st thou?\nPHI. If to Troy, of me abhorred\nThou e’er hast hoped to lead me with thy lord.\nCH. 6. So I judge best.\nPHI. Begone at once, begone!\nCH. 7. Sweet is that word, and swiftly shall be done!\nLet us be gone, each to his place on board.\n[The Chorus make as if they were going\nPHI. Nay, by dear Zeus, to whom all suppliants moan\nLeave me not yet!\nCH. 8. Keep measure in thy word.\nPHI. Stay, by Heaven, stay!\nCH. 9. What wilt thou say?\nPHI. O misery! O cruel power\nThat rul’st this hour!\nI am destroyed. Ah me!\nO poor torn limb, what shall I do with thee\nThrough all my days to be?\nAh, strangers, come, return, return!\nCH. 10. What new command are we to learn\nCrossing thy former mind?\nPHI. Ah! yet be kind.\nReprove not him, whose tongue, with grief distraught,\nObeys not, in dark storms, the helm of thought!\nCH. 11. Come, poor friend, the way we call.\nPHI. Never, learn it once for all!\nNot though he, whom Heaven obeys,\nBlast me with fierce lightning’s blaze!\nPerish Troy, and all your host,\nThat have chosen, to their cost,\nTo despise and cast me forth,\nSince my wound obscured my worth!\nAh, but, strangers, if your sense\n[page 251][1203-1233]Hath o’er-mastered this offence,\nYield but one thing to my prayer!\nCH. 12. What wouldst thou have?\nPHI. Some weapon bare,\nAxe or sword or sharpened dart,\nBring it to content my heart.\nCH. 13. What is thy new intent?\nPHI. To sever point by point\nThis body, joint from joint.\nOn bloody death my mind is bent.\nCH. 14. Wherefore?\nPHI. To see my father’s face.\nCH. 15. Where upon earth?\nPHI. He hath no place\nWhere sun doth shine, but in the halls of night.\nO native country, land of my delight,\nWould I were blest one moment with thy sight!\nWhy did I leave thy sacred dew\nAnd loose my vessels from thy shore,\nTo join the hateful Danaän crew\nAnd lend them succour? Oh, I am no more!\nLEADER OF CH.\nLong since thou hadst seen me nearing yonder ship,\nHad I not spied Odysseus and the son\nOf great Achilles hastening to our side.\nOD. Wilt thou not tell me why thou art hurrying\nThis backward journey with reverted speed?\nNEO. To undo what I have wrongly done to-day.\nOD. Thy words appal me. What is wrongly done?\nNEO. When in obeying thee and all the host—\nOD. Thou didst what deed that misbecame thy life?\nNEO. I conquered with base stratagem and fraud—\nOD. Whom? What new plan is rising in thy mind?\nNEO. Not new. But to the child of Poeas here—\nOD. What wilt thou do? I quake with strange alarm.\nNEO. From whom I took these weapons, back again——\nOD. O Heaven! thou wilt not give them! Mean’st thou this?\n[page 252][1234-1262]NEO. Yea, for I have them through base sinful means.\nOD. I pray thee, speak’st thou thus to anger me?\nNEO. If the truth anger thee, the truth is said.\nOD. Achilles’ son! What word is fallen from thee?\nNEO. Must the same syllables be thrice thrown forth?\nOD. Once was too much. Would they had ne’er been said!\nNEO. Enough. Thou hast heard my purpose clearly told.\nOD. I know what power shall thwart thee in the deed.\nNEO. Whose will shall hinder me?\nOD. The Achaean host\nAnd I among them.\nNEO. Thou’rt sharp-witted, sure!\nBut little wit or wisdom show’st thou here.\nOD. Neither thy words nor thy design is wise.\nNEO. But if ’tis righteous, that is better far.\nOD. How righteous, to release what thou hast ta’en\nBy my device?\nNEO. I sinned a shameful sin,\nAnd I will do mine utmost to retrieve it.\nOD. How? Fear’st thou not the Achaeans in this act?\nNEO. In doing right I fear not them nor thee.\nOD. I call thy power in question.\nNEO. Then I’ll fight,\nNot with Troy’s legions, but with thee.\nOD. Come on!\nLet fortune arbitrate.\nNEO. Thou seest my hand\nFeeling the hilt.\nOD. And me thou soon shalt see\nDoing the like and dallying not!—And yet\nI will not touch thee, but will go and tell\nThe army, that shall wreak this on thy head.[Exit\nNEO. Thou show’st discretion: which if thou preserve,\nThou may’st maintain a path exempt from pain.\nHo! son of Poeas, Philoctetes, come\nAnd leave thy habitation in the rock.\n[page 253][1263-1294]PHI. What noise again is troubling my poor cave?\nWhy do ye summon me? What crave ye, sirs?\nHa! ’tis some knavery. Are ye come to add\nSome monster evil to my mountainous woe?\nNEO. Fear not, but hearken to what now I speak.\nPHI. I needs must fear thee, whose fair words erewhile\nBrought me to bitter fortune.\nNEO. May not men\nRepent and change?\nPHI. Such wast thou in thy talk,\nWhen thou didst rob me of my bow,—so bright\nWithout, so black within.\nNEO. Ah, but not now,\nAssure thee! Only let me hear thy will,\nIs ’t constant to remain here and endure,\nOr to make voyage with us?\nPHI. Stop, speak no more!\nIdle and vain will all thine utterance be.\nNEO. Thou art so resolved?\nPHI. More firmly than I say.\nNEO. I would I might have brought thee to my mind,\nBut since my words are out of tune, I have done.\nPHI. Thou wert best. No word of thine can touch my soul\nOr win me to thy love, who by deceit\nHast reft my life away. And then thou com’st\nTo school me,—of noblest father, basest son!\nPerish, the Atridae first of all, and then\nLaërtes’ child, and thou!\nNEO. Curse me no more,\nBut take this hallowed weapon from my hand.\nPHI. What words are these? Am I again deceived?\nNEO. No, by the holiest name of Zeus on high!\nPHI. O voice of gladness, if thy speech be true!\nNEO. The deed shall prove it. Only reach thy hand,\nAnd be again sole master of thy bow.[ODYSSEUS appears\nOD. But I make protest, in the sight of Heaven,\nFor Atreus’ sons, and all the Achaean host.\n[page 254][1295-1330]PHI. Dear son, whose voice disturbs us? Do I hear\nOdysseus?\nOD. Ay, and thou behold’st him nigh,\nAnd he shall force thee to the Trojan plain,\nHowe’er Achilles’ offspring make or mar.\nPHI. This shaft shall bear thee sorrow for that boast.\nNEO. Let it not fly, by Heaven!\nPHI. Dear child, let go\nMine arm!\nNEO. I will not.[Exit ODYSSEUS\nPHI. Ah! Why hast thou robbed\nMy bow of bringing down mine enemy?\nNEO. This were ignoble both for thee and me.\nPHI. One thing is manifest, the first o’ the host\nLying forerunners of the Achaean band,\nAre brave with words, but cowards with the steel.\nNEO. Well, now the bow is thine. Thou hast no cause\nFor blame or anger any more ’gainst me.\nPHI. None. Thou hast proved thy birthright, dearest boy.\nNot from the loins of Sisyphus thou earnest,\nBut from Achilles, who in life was held\nNoblest of men alive, and now o’ the dead.\nNEO. It gladdens me that thou shouldst speak in praise\nBoth of my sire and me. But hear me tell\nThe boon for which I sue thee.—Mortal men\nMust bear such evils as high Heaven ordains;\nBut those afflicted by self-chosen ills,\nLike thine to-day, receive not from just men\nOr kind indulgence or compassionate thought.\nAnd thou art restive grown, and wilt not hearken,\nBut though one counsel thee with kind’st intent,\nWilt take him for a dark malignant foe.\nYet, calling Zeus to witness for my soul,\nOnce more I will speak. Know this, and mark it well:\nThou bear’st this sickness by a heavenly doom,\nThrough coming near to Chrysa’s sentinel,\nThe lurking snake, that guards the sky-roofed fold.\nAnd from this plague thou ne’er shall find reprieve\n[page 255][1330-1368]While the same Sun god rears him from the east\nAnd droops to west again, till thou be come\nOf thine own willing mind to Troia’s plain,\nWhere our physicians, sons of Phoebus’ child,\nShall soothe thee from thy sore, and thou with me\nAnd with this bow shalt take Troy’s citadel.\nHow do I know this? I will tell thee straight\nWe have a Trojan captive, Helenus,\nBoth prince and prophet, who hath clearly told\nThis must be so, yea, and ere harvest time\nThis year, great Troy must fall, else if his words\nBe falsified, who will may slay the seer.\nNow, since thou know’st of this, yield thy consent;\nFor glorious is the gain, being singled forth\nFrom all the Greeks as noblest, first to come\nTo healing hands, and then to win renown\nUnrivalled, vanquishing all tearful Troy.\nPHI. Oh how I hate my life! Why must it keep\nThis breathing form from sinking to the shades?\nHow can I prove a rebel to his mind\nWho thus exhorts me with affectionate heart?\nAnd yet, oh misery! must I give way?\nThen how could I endure the light of heaven?\nWith whom could I exchange a word? Ay me!\nEyes that have seen each act of my sad life,\nHow could ye bear it, to behold the sons\nOf Atreus, my destroyers, comrades now\nAnd friends! Laërtes’ wicked son, my friend!\nAnd less I feel the grief of former wrong\nThan shudder with expectance of fresh harm\nThey yet may work on me. For when the mind\nHath once been mother of an evil brood,\nIt nurses nought but evils. Yea, at thee\nI marvel. Thou should’st ne’er return to Troy,\nNor suffer me to go, when thou remember’st\nWhat insult they have done thee, ravishing\nThy father’s rights from thee. And wilt thou then\nSail to befriend them, pressing me in aid?\nNay, do not, son; but, even as thou hast sworn,\nConvey me home, and thou, in Scyros dwelling,\n[page 256][1369-1402]Leave to their evil doom those evil men.\nSo thou shalt win a twofold gratitude\nFrom me and from my father, and not seem,\nHelping vile men, to be as vile as they.\nNEO. ’Tis fairly spoken. Yet I would that thou\nRelying on my word and on Heaven’s aid,\nWould’st voyage forth from Lemnos with thy friend.\nPHI. Mean’st thou to Troy, and to the hateful sons\nOf Atreus, me, with this distressful limb?\nNEO. Nay, but to those that will relieve the pain\nOf thy torn foot and heal thee of thy plague.\nPHI. Thy words are horrible. What mean’st thou, boy?\nNEO. The act I deem the noblest for us both.\nPHI. Wilt thou speak so? Where is thy fear of Heaven?\nNEO. Why should I fear, when I see certain gain?\nPHI. Gain for the sons of Atreus, or for me?\nNEO. Methinks a friend should give thee friendly counsel.\nPHI. Friendly, to hand me over to my foes?\nNEO. Ah, be not hardened in thy misery!\nPHI. I know thou wilt ruin me by what thou speakest.\nNEO. Not I. The case is dark to thee, I see.\nPHI. I know the Atreidae cast me on this rock.\nNEO. But how, if they should save thee afterward?\nPHI. They ne’er shall make me see Troy with my will.\nNEO. Hard is my fortune, then, if by no sleight\nOf reasoning I can draw thee to my mind.\nFor me, ’twere easiest to end speech, that thou\nMight’st live on as thou livest in hopeless pain.\nPHI. Then leave me to my fate!—But thou hast touched\nMy right hand with thine own, and given consent\nTo bear me to my home. Do this, dear son!\nAnd do not linger to take thought of Troy.\nEnough that name hath echoed in my groans.\nNEO. If thou wilt, let us be going.\nPHI. Nobly hast thou said the word.\n[page 257][1402-1436]NEO. Lean thy steps on mine.\nPHI. As firmly as my foot will strength afford.\nNEO. Ah! but how shall I escape Achaean anger?\nPHI. Do not care!\nNEO. Ah! but should they spoil my country!\nPHI. I to shield thee will be there.\nNEO. How to shield me, how to aid me?\nPHI. With the shafts of Heracles\nI will scare them.\nNEO. Give thy blessing to this isle, and come in peace.\nHERACLES appears from above.\nHERACLES. First, son of Poeas, wait till thou hast heard\nThe voice of Heracles, and weighed his word.\nHim thou beholdest from the Heavenly seat\nCome down, for thee leaving the blest retreat,\nTo tell thee all high Zeus intends, and stay\nThy purpose in the journey of to-day.\nThen hear me, first how after my long toils\nBy strange adventure I have found and won\nImmortal glory, which thine eyes perceive;\nAnd the like lot, I tell thee, shall be thine,\nAfter these pains to rise to glorious fame.\nSailing with this thy comrade to Troy-town,\nFirst thou shalt heal thee from thy grievous sore,\nAnd then, being singled forth from all the host\nAs noblest, thou shalt conquer with that bow\nParis, prime author of these years of harm,\nAnd capture Troy, and bear back to thy hall\nThe choicest guerdon, for thy valour’s meed,\nTo Oeta’s vale and thine own father’s home.\nBut every prize thou tak’st be sure thou bear\nUnto my pyre, in memory of my bow.\nThis word, Achilles’ offspring, is for thee\nNo less. For, as thou could’st not without him,\nSo, without thee, he cannot conquer Troy.\nThen, like twin lions hunting the same hill,\n[page 258][1437-1471]Guard thou him, and he thee! and I will send\nAsclepius Troyward to relieve thy pain.\nFor Ilion now a second time must fall\nBefore the Herculean bow. But, take good heed,\nMidst all your spoil to hold the gods in awe.\nFor our great Father counteth piety\nFar above all. This follows men in death,\nAnd fails them not when they resign their breath.\nPHI. Thou whom I have longed to see,\nThy dear voice is law to me.\nNEO. I obey with gladdened heart.\nHER. Lose no time: at once depart!\nBright occasion and fair wind\nUrge your vessel from behind.\nPHI. Come, let me bless the region ere I go.\nPoor house, sad comrade of my watch, farewell!\nYe nymphs of meadows where soft waters flow\nThou ocean headland, pealing thy deep knell,\nWhere oft within my cavern as I lay\nMy hair was moist with dashing south-wind’s spray,\nAnd ofttimes came from Hermes’ foreland high\nSad replication of my storm-vext cry;\nYe fountains and thou Lycian water sweet,—\nI never thought to leave you, yet my feet\nAre turning from your paths,—we part for aye.\nFarewell! and waft me kindly on my way,\nO Lemnian earth enclosed by circling seas,\nTo sail, where mighty Fate my course decrees,\nAnd friendly voices point me, and the will\nOf that heroic power, who doth this act fulfil.\nCH. Come now all in one strong band;\nThen, ere loosing from the land,\nPray we to the nymphs of sea\nKind protectresses to be,\nTill we touch the Trojan strand.",

    "content":"WOMEN OF TRACHIS\nTHE PERSONS\nDÊANIRA, wife of Heracles.\nAn Attendant.\nHYLLUS, son of Heracles and Dêanira.\nCHORUS of Trachinian Maidens.\nA Messenger.\nLICHAS, the Herald.\nA Nurse.\nAn Old Man.\nHERACLES.\nIOLE, who does not speak.\nSCENE. Before the temporary abode of Heracles in Trachis.\n[page 176]This tragedy is named from the Chorus. From the subject it might have been called ‘Deanira or the Death of Heracles’.\nThe Centaur Nessus, in dying by the arrow of Heracles, which had been dipped in the venom of the Hydra, persuaded the bride Deanira, whose beauty was the cause of his death, to keep some of the blood from the wound as a love-charm for her husband. Many years afterwards, when Heracles was returning from his last exploit of sacking Oechalia, in Euboea, he sent before him, by his herald Lichas, Iole, the king’s daughter, whom he had espoused. Deanira, when she had discovered this, commissioned Lichas when he returned to present his master with a robe, which she had anointed with the charm,—hoping by this means to regain her lord’s affection. But the poison of the Hydra did its work, and Heracles died in agony, Deanira having already killed herself on ascertaining what she had done. The action takes place in Trachis, near the Mahae Gulf, where Heracles and Deanira, by permission of Ceyx, the king of the country, have been living in exile. At the close of the drama, Heracles, while yet alive, is carried towards his pyre on Mount Oeta.\n[page 177]\nTHE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS\nDÊANIRA. Men say,—’twas old experience gave the word,\n—‘No lot of mortal, ere he die, can once\nBe known for good or evil.’ But I know,\nBefore I come to the dark dwelling-place,\nMine is a lot, adverse and hard and sore.\nWho yet at Pleuron, in my father’s home,\nOf all Aetolian women had most cause\nTo fear my bridal. For a river-god,\nSwift Achelôüs, was my suitor there\nAnd sought me from my father in three forms;\nNow in his own bull-likeness, now a serpent\nOf coiling sheen, and now with manlike build\nBut bovine front, while from the shadowy beard\nSprang fountain-waters in perpetual spray.\nLooking for such a husband, I, poor girl!\nStill prayed that Death might find me, ere I knew\nThat nuptial.—Later, to my glad relief,\nZeus’ and Alcmena’s glorious offspring came,\nAnd closed with him in conflict, and released\nMy heart from torment. How the fight was won\nI could not tell. If any were who saw\nUnshaken of dread foreboding, such may speak.\nBut I sate quailing with an anguished fear,\nLest beauty might procure me nought but pain,\nTill He that rules the issue of all strife,\nGave fortunate end—if fortunate! For since,\nAssigned by that day’s conquest, I have known\nThe couch of Heracles, my life is spent\nIn one continual terror for his fate.\nNight brings him, and, ere morning, some fresh toil\nDrives him afar. And I have borne him seed;\nWhich he, like some strange husbandman that farms\n[page 178]A distant field, finds but at sowing time\nAnd once in harvest. Such a weary life\nStill tossed him to and fro,—no sooner home\nBut forth again, serving I know not whom.\nAnd when his glorious head had risen beyond\nThese labours, came the strongest of my fear.\nFor since he quelled the might of Iphitus,\nWe here in Trachis dwell, far from our home,\nDependent on a stranger, but where he\nIs gone, none knoweth. Only this I know,\nHis going pierced my heart with pangs for him,\nAnd now I am all but sure he bears some woe.\nThese fifteen months he hath sent me not one word.\nAnd I have cause for fear. Ere he set forth\nHe left a scroll with me, whose dark intent\nI oft pray Heaven may bring no sorrow down.\nATTENDANT. Queen Dêanira, many a time ere now\nHave I beheld thee with all tearful moan\nBewailing the departure of thy lord.\nBut, if it be permitted that a slave\nShould tender counsel to the free, my voice\nMay venture this:—Of thy strong band of sons\nWhy is not one commissioned to explore\nFor Heracles? and why not Hyllus first,\nWhom most it would beseem to show regard\nFor tidings of his father’s happiness?\nAh! here I see him bounding home, with feet\nApt for employment! If you count me wise,\nHe and my words attend upon your will.\nEnter HYLLUS.\nDÊ. Dear child, dear boy! even from the lowliest head\nWise counsel may come forth. This woman here,\nThough a bond-maiden, hath a free-born tongue.\nHYL. What word is spoken, mother? May I know?\nDÊ. That, with thy father lost to us so long,\n’Tis shame thou dost not learn his dwelling-place.\nHYL. Yea, I have learnt, if one may trust report.\nDÊ. Where art thou told his seat is fixed, my son?\n[page 179]HYL. ’Tis said that through the length of this past year\nHe wrought as bondman to a Lydian girl.\nDÊ. Hath he borne that? Then nothing can be strange!\nHYL. Well, that is over, I am told. He is free.\nDÊ. Where is he rumoured, then, alive or dead?\nHYL. In rich Euboea, besieging, as they tell,\nThe town of Eurytus, or offering siege.\nDÊ. Child, hast thou heard what holy oracles\nHe left with me, touching that very land?\nHYL. What were they, mother, for I never knew?\nDÊ. That either he must end his being there,\nOr, this one feat performed, his following time\nShould grace his life with fair prosperity.\nWilt thou not then, my child, when he is held\nIn such a crisis of uncertain peril,\nRun to his aid?—since we must perish with him,\nOr owe our lasting safety to his life.\nHYL. I will go, mother. Had I heard this voice\nOf prophecy, long since I had been there.\nFear is unwonted for our father’s lot.\nBut now I know, my strength shall all be spent\nTo learn the course of these affairs in full.\nDÊ. Go then, my son. Though late, to learn and do\nWhat wisdom bids, hath certainty of gain.\n[Exit HYLLUS. DÊANIRA withdraws\nCHORUS (entering and turning towards the East).\nBorn of the starry night in her undoing,I 1\nLulled in her bosom at thy parting glow,\nO Sun! I bid thee show,\nWhat journey is Alcmena’s child pursuing?\nWhat region holds him now,\n’Mong winding channels of the deep,\nOr Asian plains, or rugged Western steep?\nDeclare it, thou\nPeerless in vision of thy flashing ray\nThat lightens on the world with each new day.\n[page 180]Sad Dêanira, bride of battle-wooing,I 2 [104-143]\nNe’er lets her tearful eyelids close in rest,\nBut in love-longing breast,\nLike some lorn bird its desolation rueing,\nOf her great husband’s way\nStill mindful, worn with harrowing fear\nLest some new danger for him should be near,\nBy night and day\nPines on her widowed couch of ceaseless thought,\nWith dread of evil destiny distraught:[Enter DÊANIRA.\nFor many as are billows of the SouthII 1\nBlowing unweariedly, or Northern gale,\nOne going and another coming on\nIncessantly, baffling the gazer’s eye,\nSuch Cretan ocean of unending toil\nCradles our Cadmus-born, and swells his fame.\nBut still some power doth his foot recall\nFrom stumbling down to Hades’ darkling hall.\nWherefore, in censure of thy mood, I bringII 2\nGlad, though opposing, counsel. Let not hope\nGrow weary. Never hath a painless life\nBeen cast on mortals by the power supreme\nOf the All-disposer, Cronos’ son. But joy\nAnd sorrow visit in perpetual round\nAll mortals, even as circleth still on high\nThe constellation of the Northern sky.\nWhat lasteth in the world? Not starry night,III\nNor wealth, nor tribulation; but is gone\nAll suddenly, while to another soul\nThe joy or the privation passeth on.\nThese hopes I bid thee also, O my Queen!\nHold fast continually, for who hath seen\nZeus so forgetful of his own?\nHow can his providence forsake his son?\nDÊ. I see you have been told of my distress,\nAnd that hath brought you. But my inward woe,\nBe it evermore unknown to you, as now!\n[page 181][144-179]Such the fair garden of untrammeled ease\nWhere the young life grows safely. No fierce heat,\nNo rain, no wind disturbs it, but unharmed\nIt rises amid airs of peace and joy,\nTill maiden turn to matron, and the night\nInherit her dark share of anxious thought,\nHaunted with fears for husband or for child.\nThen, imaged through her own calamity,\nSome one may guess the burden of my life.\nFull many have been the sorrows I have wept,\nBut one above the rest I tell to-day.\nWhen my great husband parted last from home,\nHe left within the house an ancient scroll\nInscribed with characters of mystic note,\nWhich Heracles had never heretofore,\nIn former labours, cared to let me see,—\nAs bound for bright achievement, not for death.\nBut now, as though his life had end, he told\nWhat marriage-portion I must keep, what shares\nHe left his sons out of their father’s ground:\nAnd set a time, when fifteen moons were spent,\nCounted from his departure, that even then\nOr he must die, or if that date were out\nAnd he had run beyond it, he should live\nThenceforth a painless and untroubled life.\nSuch by Heaven’s fiat was the promised end\nOf Heracles’ long labours, as he said;\nSo once the ancient oak-tree had proclaimed\nIn high Dodona through the sacred Doves.\nOf which prediction on this present hour\nIn destined order of accomplishment\nThe veritable issue doth depend.\nAnd I, dear friends, while taking rest, will oft\nStart from sweet slumbers with a sudden fear,\nScared by the thought, my life may be bereft\nOf the best husband in the world of men.\nCH. Hush! For I see approaching one in haste,\nGarlanded, as if laden with good news.\n[page 182][180-212]\nEnter Messenger.\nMESSENGER. Queen Dêanira, mine shall be the tongue\nTo free thee first from fear. Alcmena’s child\nIs living, be assured, and triumphing,\nAnd bringing to our Gods the fruits of war.\nDÊ. What mean’st thou, aged sir, by what thou sayest?\nMESS. That soon thy husband, envied all around,\nWill come, distinguished with victorious might.\nDÊ. What citizen or stranger told thee this?\nMESS. Your herald Lichas, where the oxen graze\nThe summer meadow, cries this to a crowd.\nI, hearing, flew off hither, that being first\nTo bring thee word thereof, I might be sure\nTo win reward and gratitude from thee.\nDÊ. And how is he not here, if all be well?\nMESS. Crossed by no light impediment, my Queen.\nFor all the Maliac people, gathering round,\nThrong him with question, that he cannot move.\nBut he must still the travail of each soul,\nAnd none will be dismissed unsatisfied.\nSuch willing audience he unwillingly\nHarangues, but soon himself will come in sight.\nDÊ. O Zeus! who rulest Oeta’s virgin wold,\nAt last, though late, thou hast vouchsafed us joy.\nLift up your voices, O my women! ye\nWithin the halls, and ye beyond the gate!\nFor now we reap the gladness of a ray,\nThat dawns unhoped for in this rumour’s sound.\nCHORUS\nWith a shout by the hearth let the palace roof ring\nFrom those that are dreaming of bridal, and ye,\nYoung men, let your voices in harmony sing\nTo the God of the quiver, the Lord of the free!\nAnd the Paean withal from the maiden band\nTo Artemis, huntress of many a land,\nLet it rise o’er the glad roof tree,\n[page 183][213-243]To Phoebus’ own sister, with fire in each hand,\nAnd the Nymphs that her co-mates be!\nMy spirit soars. O sovereign of my soul!\nI will accept the thrilling flute’s control.[They dance\nThe ivy-crownèd thyrsus, see!\nWith Bacchic fire is kindling me,\nAnd turns my emulous tread\nWhere’er the mazy dance may lead.\nEuoî! Euoî!\nO Paean! send us joy.\nSee, dearest Queen, behold!\nBefore thy gaze the event will now unfold.\nDÊ. Think not mine eye hath kept such careless guard,\nDear maids, that I could miss this moving train.\nHerald, I bid thee hail, although so late\nAppearing, if thou bringest health with thee!\nEnter LICHAS, with Captive Women.\nLICHAS. A happy welcome on a happy way,\nAs prosperous our achievement. Meet it is\nGood words should greet bright actions, mistress mine!\nDÊ. Kind friend, first tell me what I first would know—\nShall I receive my Heracles alive?\nLICH. I left him certainly alive and strong:\nBlooming in health, not with disease oppressed.\nDÊ. In Greece, or in some barbarous country? Tell!\nLICH. Euboea’s island hath a promontory,\nWhere to Cenaean Zeus he consecrates\nRich altars and the tribute of the ground.\nDÊ. Moved by an oracle, or from some vow?\nLICH. So vowed he when he conquered with the spear\nThe country of these women whom you see.\nDÊ. And who, by Heaven, are they? Who was their sire?\nTheir case is piteous, or eludes my thought.\n[page 184][244-280]LICH. He took them for the service of the Gods\nAnd his own house, when high Oechalia fell.\nDÊ. Was’t then before that city he was kept\nThose endless ages of uncounted time?\nLICH. Not so. The greater while he was detained\nAmong the Lydians, sold, as he declares,\nTo bondage. Nor be jealous of the word,\nSince Heaven, my Queen, was author of the deed.\nEnthrallèd so to Asian Omphalè,\nHe, as himself avers, fulfilled his year.\nThe felt reproach whereof so chafed his soul,\nHe bound fierce curses on himself and sware\nThat,—children, wife and all,—he yet would bring\nIn captive chains the mover of this harm.\nNor did this perish like an idle word,\nBut, when the stain was off him, straight he drew\nAllied battalions to assault the town\nOf Eurytus, whom, sole of earthly powers,\nHe had noted as the source of his annoy,\nBecause, having received him in his hall\nA guest of ancient days, he burst on him\nWith outrage of loud voice and villanous mind,\nSaying, ‘with his hand upon the unerring bow,\nOechalia’s princes could o’ershoot his skill;\nAnd born to bondage, he must quail beneath\nHis overlord’; lastly, to crown this cry,\nWhen at a banquet he was filled with wine,\nHe flung him out of door. Whereat being wroth,\nWhen Iphitus to the Tirynthian height\nFollowed the track where his brood-mares had strayed,\nHe, while the thought and eye of the man by chance\nWere sundered, threw him from the tower-crowned cliff.\nIn anger for which deed the Olympian King,\nFather of Gods and men, delivered him\nTo be a bond-slave, nor could brook the offence,\nThat of all lives he vanquished, this alone\nShould have been ta’en by guile. For had he wrought\nIn open quittance of outrageous wrong,\nEven Zeus had granted that his cause was just.\nThe braggart hath no favour even in Heaven.\n[page 185][281-316]Whence they, o’erweening with their evil tongue,\nAre now all dwellers in the house of death,\nTheir ancient city a captive;—but these women\nWhom thou beholdest, from their blest estate\nBrought suddenly to taste of piteous woe,\nCome to thy care. This task thy wedded lord\nOrdained, and I, his faithful minister,\nSeek to perform.

How if a princess, offspring of their King?\n[page 186][317-348]LICH. I cannot tell. I did not question far.\nDÊ. Have none of her companions breathed her name?\nLICH. I brought them silently. I did not hear.\nDÊ. Yet speak it to us of thyself, poor maid!\n’Tis sorrow not to know thee who thou art.\nLICH. She’ll ne’er untie her tongue, if she maintain\nAn even tenor, since nor more nor less\nWould she disclose; but, poor unfortunate!\nWith agonizing sobs and tears she mourns\nThis crushing sorrow, from the day she left\nHer wind-swept home. Her case is cruel, sure,—\nAnd claims a privilege from all who feel.\nDÊ. Well, let her go, and pass beneath the roof\nIn peace, as she desires; nor let fresh pain\nFrom me be added to her previous woe.\nShe hath enough already.

What? Tell me thy full meaning clearly forth.\nThat thou hast uttered is all mystery.\nMESS. I heard this herald say, while many thronged\nTo hearken, that this maiden was the cause,\nWhy lofty-towered Oechalia and her lord\nFell before Heracles, whom Love alone\nOf heavenly powers had warmed to this emprise,\nAnd not the Lydian thraldom or the tasks\nOf rigorous Omphalè, nor that wild fate\nOf rock-thrown Iphitus. Now he thrusts aside\nThe Love-god, contradicting his first tale.\nWhen he that was her sire could not be brought\nTo yield the maid for Heracles to hold\nIn love unrecognized, he framed erelong\nA feud about some trifle, and set forth\nIn arms against this damsel’s fatherland\n(Where Eurytus, the herald said, was king)\nAnd slew the chief her father; yea, and sacked\nTheir city. Now returning, as you see,\nHe sends her hither to his halls, no slave,\nNor unregarded, lady,—dream not so!\nSince all his heart is kindled with desire.\nI, O my Queen! thought meet to show thee all\nThe tale I chanced to gather from his mouth,\nWhich many heard as well as I, i’ the midst\nOf Trachis’ market-place, and can confirm\nMy witness. I am pained if my plain speech\nSound harshly, but the honest truth I tell.\nDÊ. Ah me! Where am I? Whither am I fallen?\nWhat hidden woe have I unwarily\nTaken beneath my roof? O misery!\nWas she unknown, as he that brought her sware?\nMESS. Nay, most distinguished both in birth and mien;\nCalled in her day of freedom Iolè,\nEurytus’ daughter,—of whose parentage,\nForsooth as ignorant, he ne’er would speak.\nCH. I curse not all the wicked, but the man\nWhose secret practices deform his life.\n[page 188][385-413]DÊ. Say, maidens, how must I proceed? The words\nNow spoken have bewildered all my mind.\nCH. Go in and question Lichas, who perchance\nWill tell the truth if you but tax him home.\nDÊ. I will; you counsel reasonably.\nMESS. And I,\nShall I bide here till thou com’st forth? Or how?\nDÊ.

So slow in coming, and so quickly flown,\nEre one have time to talk with thee anew!\nLICH. What wouldst thou ask me? I am bent to hear.\nDÊ. And art thou bent on truth in the reply?\nLICH. By Heaven! in all that I have knowledge of.\nDÊ. Then tell me, who is she thou brought’st with thee?\nLICH. An islander. I cannot trace her stock.\nMESS. Look hither, man. Who is’t to whom thou speakest?\nLICH. Why such a question? What is thine intent?\nMESS. Nay, start not, but make answer if thou knowest.\nLICH. To Dêanira, Oeneus’ queenly child,\nHeracles’ wife,—if these mine eyes be true,—\nMy mistress.\nMESS. Ay, that is the very word\nI longed to hear thee speak. Thy mistress, sayest?\nLICH. To whom I am bound.\nMESS. Hold there! What punishment\nWilt thou accept, if thou art found to be\nFaithless to her?\nLICH. I faithless! What dark speech\nHast thou contrived?\nMESS. Not I at all. ’Tis thou\nDost wrap thy thoughts i’ the dark.\n[page 189][414-448]LICH. Well, I will go.\n’Tis folly to have heard thee for so long.\nMESS. You go not till you answer one word more.\nLICH. One, or a thousand! You’ll not stint, I see.\nMESS. Thou knowest the captive maid thou leddest home?\nLICH. I do. But wherefore ask?\nMESS. Did you not say\nThat she, on whom you look with ignorant eye,\nWas Iolè, the daughter of the King,\nCommitted to your charge?\nLICH. Where? Among whom?\nWhat witness of such words will bear thee out?\nMESS. Many and sound. A goodly company\nIn Trachis’ market-place heard thee speak this.\nLICH. Ay.\nI said ’twas rumoured. But I could not give\nMy vague impression for advised report.\nMESS. Impression, quotha! Did you not on oath\nProclaim your captive for your master’s bride?\nLICH. My master’s bride! Dear lady, by the Gods,\nWho is the stranger? for I know him not.\nMESS. One who was present where he heard thee tell,\nHow that whole city was subdued and taken,\nNot for the bondage to the Lydian girl,\nBut through the longing passion for this maid.\nLICH. Dear lady, let the fellow be removed.\nTo prate with madmen is mere foolishness.\nDÊ. Nay, I entreat thee by His name, whose fire\nLightens down Oeta’s topmost glen, be not\nA niggard of the truth. Thou tell’st thy tale\nTo no weak woman, but to one who knows\nMankind are never constant to one joy.\nWhoso would buffet Love, aspires in vain.\nFor Love leads even Immortals at his will,\nAnd me. Then how not others, like to me?\n’Twere madness, sure, in me to blame my lord\nWhen this hath caught him, or the woman there,\nHis innocent accomplice in a thing,\nNo shame to either, and no harm to me.\n[page 190][449-490]It is not so. But if from him thou learnest\nThe lore of falsehood, it were best unlearnt;\nOr if the instruction comes of thine own thought,\nSuch would-be kindness doth not prove thee kind.\nThen tell me all the truth. To one free-born\nThe name of liar is a hateful lot.\nAnd thou canst not be hid. Thy news was heard\nBy many, who will tell me. If thou fearest,\nThou hast no cause—for doubtfulness is pain,\nBut to know all, what harm? His loves ere now\nWere they not manifold? And none hath borne\nReproach or evil word from me. She shall not,\nThough his new passion were as strong as death;\nSince most mine eye hath pitied her, because\nHer beauty was the ruin of her life,\nAnd all unweeting, she her own bright land,\nPoor hapless one! hath ravaged and enslaved.—\nLet that be as it must. But for thy part,\nThough false to others, be still true to me.\nCH. ’Tis fairly said. Comply. Thou ne’er wilt blame\nHer faithfulness, and thou wilt earn our loves.\nLICH. Yea, dear my Queen, now I have seen thee hold\nThy mortal wishes within mortal bound\nSo meekly, I will freely tell thee all.\nIt is as he avers. This maiden’s love,\nPiercing through Heracles, was the sole cause,\nWhy her Oechalia, land of plenteous woe,\nWas made the conquest of his spear. And he—\nFor I dare so far clear him—never bade\nConcealment or denial. But myself,\nFearing the word might wound thy queenly heart,\nSinned, if thou count such tenderness a sin.\nBut now that all is known, for both your sakes,\nHis, and thine own no less, look favouringly\nUpon the woman, and confirm the word\nThou here hast spoken in regard to her:—\nFor he, whose might is in all else supreme,\nIs wholly overmastered by her love.\nDÊ. Yea, so my mind is bent. I will do so.\n[page 191][491-519]I will not, in a bootless strife ’gainst Heaven,\nAugment my misery with self-sought ill.\nCome, go we in, that thou may’st bear from me\nSuch message as is meet, and also carry\nGifts, such as are befitting to return\nFor gifts new-given. Thou ought’st not to depart\nUnladen, having brought so much with thee.[Exeunt\nCHORUS.\nVictorious in her might,I 1\nThe Queen of soft delight\nStill ranges onward with triumphant sway.\nWhat she from Kronos’ son\nAnd strong Poseidon won,\nAnd Pluto, King of Night, I durst not say.\nBut who, to earn this bride,\nCame forth in sinewy pride\nTo strive, or e’er the nuptial might be known\nWith fearless heart I tell\nWhat heroes wrestled well,\nWith showering blows, and dust in clouds upthrown.\nOne was a river bold,I 2\nHorn-crowned, with tramp fourfold,\nBull Achelôüs, Acarnania’s Fear;\nAnd one from Bacchus’ town,\nOwn son of Zeus, came down,\nWith brandished mace, bent bow, and barbèd spear.\nWho then in battle brunt,\nTogether, front to front,\nHurled, eager both to win the beauteous prize;\nAnd Cypris ’mid the fray\nAlone, that dreadful day,\nSate umpire, holding promise in her eyes.\nThen clashed the fist, then clanged the bow;II\nThen horns gave crashing blow for blow,\nWhilst, as they clung,\n[page 192][520-555]The twining hip throw both essay\nAnd hurtling foreheads’ fearful play,\nAnd groans from each were wrung.\nBut the tender fair one far away\nSate watching with an eye of piteous cheer\n(A mother’s heart will heed the thing I say,)\nTill won by him who freed her from her fear.\nSudden she leaves her mother’s gentle side,\nBorne through the waste, our hero’s tender bride.\nEnter DÊANIRA.\nDÊ. Dear friends, while yonder herald in the house\nHolds converse with the captives ere he go,\nI have stol’n forth to you, partly to tell\nThe craft my hand hath compassed, and in part,\nTo crave your pity for my wretchedness.\nFor I have taken to my hearth a maid,—\nAnd yet, methinks, no maiden any more,\nLike some fond shipmaster, taking on board\nA cargo fraught with treason to my heart.\nAnd now we two are closed in one embrace\nBeneath one coverlet. Such generous meed\nFor faith in guarding home this dreary while\nHath the kind Heracles our trusty spouse,\nSent in return! Yet, oft as he hath caught\nThis same distemperature, I know not how\nTo harbour indignation against him.\nBut who that is a woman could endure\nTo dwell with her, both married to one man?\nOne bloom is still advancing, one doth fade.\nThe budding flower is cropped, the full-blown head\nIs left to wither, while love passeth by\nUnheeding. Wherefore I am sore afraid\nHe will be called my husband, but her mate,\nFor she is younger. Yet no prudent wife\nWould take this angerly, as I have said.\nBut, dear ones, I will tell you of a way,\nWhereof I have bethought me, to prevent\nThis heart-break. I had hidden of long time\n[page 193][555-591]In a bronze urn the ancient Centaur’s gift,\nWhich I, when a mere girl, culled from the wound\nOf hairy-breasted Nessus in his death.\nHe o’er Evenus’ rolling depths, for hire,\nFerried wayfarers on his arm, not plying\nOr rowing-boat, or canvas-wingèd bark.\nWho, when with Heracles, a new-made bride,\nI followed by my father’s sending forth,\nShouldering me too, in the mid-stream, annoyed\nWith wanton touch. And I cried out; and he,\nZeus’ son, turned suddenly, and from his bow\nSent a wing’d shaft, that whizzed into his chest\nTo the lungs. Then the weird Thing, with dying voice\nSpake to me:—‘Child of aged Oeneüs,\nSince thou wert my last burden, thou shalt win\nSome profit from mine act, if thou wilt do\nWhat now I bid thee. With a careful hand\nCollect and bear away the clotted gore\nThat clogs my wound, e’en where the monster snake\nHad dyed the arrow with dark tinct of gall;\nAnd thou shalt have this as a charm of soul\nFor Heracles, that never through the eye\nShall he receive another love than thine.’\nWhereof bethinking me, for since his death\nI kept it in a closet locked with care,\nI have applied it to this robe, with such\nAddition as his living voice ordained.—\nThe thing is done. No criminal attempts\nCould e’er be mine. Far be they from my thought,\nAs I abhor the woman who conceives them!\nBut if by any means through gentle spells\nAnd bonds on Heracles’ affection, we\nMay triumph o’er this maiden in his heart,\nMy scheme is perfected. Unless you deem\nMine action wild. If so, I will desist.\nCH. If any ground of confidence approve\nThine act, we cannot check thy counsel here.\nDÊ. My confidence is grounded on belief,\nThough unconfirmed as yet by actual proof.\n[page 194][592-627]CH. Well, do it and try. Assurance cannot come\nTill action bring experience after it.\nDÊ. The truth will soon be known. The man e’en now\nIs coming forth, and quickly will be there.\nScreen ye but well my counsel. Doubtful deeds,\nWrapt close, will not deliver us to shame.\nEnter LICHAS.\nLICH. Daughter of Oeneus, tell me thy commands.\nAlready time rebukes our tardiness.\nDÊ. Even that hath been my care, Lichas, while thou\nWert talking to the stranger-maids within,\nThat thou shouldst take for me this finewoven web,\nA present from these fingers to my lord.\nAnd when thou giv’st it, say that none of men\nMust wear it on his shoulders before him;\nAnd neither light of sun may look upon it,\nNor holy temple-court, nor household flame,\nTill he in open station ’fore the Gods\nDisplay it on a day when bulls are slaughtered.\nSo once I vowed, that should I ever see\nOr hear his safe return, I would enfold\nHis glorious person in this robe, and show\nTo all the Gods in doing sacrifice\nHim a fresh worshipper in fresh array.—\nThe truth hereof he will with ease descry\nBetokened on this treasure-guarding seal.—\nNow go, and be advised, of this in chief,\nTo act within thine office; then of this,\nTo bear thee so, that from his thanks and mine\nMeeting in one, a twofold grace may spring.\nLICH. If this my Hermes-craft be firm and sure,\nThen never will I fail thee, O my Queen!\nBut I will show the casket as it is\nTo whom I bear it, and in faithfulness\nAdd all the words thou sendest in fit place.\nDÊ. Go, then, at once. Thou hast full cognizance\nHow things within the palace are preserved?\nLICH. I know, and will declare. There is no flaw.\n[page 195][628-662]DÊ. Methinks thou knowest too, for thou hast seen,\nMy kind reception of the stranger-maid?\nLICH. I saw, and was amazed with heart-struck joy.\nDÊ.

Now I perceive how fond\nIs eagerness, where actions are obscure.\nCH. Tell, if it may be told, thy cause of fear.\nDÊ. A thing is come to pass, which should I tell,\nWill strike you with strange wonder when you learn.\nFor, O my friends, the stuff wherewith I dressed\nThat robe, a flock of soft and milkwhite wool,\nIs shrivelled out of sight, not gnawn by tooth\nOf any creature here, but, self-consumed,\nFrittered and wasting on the courtyard-stones.\nTo let you know the circumstance at full,\nI will speak on. Of all the Centaur-Thing,\nWhen labouring in his side with the fell point\nO’ the shaft, enjoined me, I had nothing lost,\nBut his vaticination in my heart\nRemained indelible, as though engraved\nWith pen of iron upon brass. ’Twas thus:—\nI was to keep this unguent closely hid\nIn dark recesses, where no heat of fire\nOr warming ray might reach it, till with fresh\nAnointing I addressed it to an end.\nSo I had done. And now this was to do,\nWithin my chamber covertly I spread\nThe ointment with piece of wool, a tuft\nPulled from a home-bred sheep; and, as ye saw,\nI folded up my gift and packed it close\nIn hollow casket from the glaring sun.\nBut, entering in, a fact encounters me\nPast human wit to fathom with surmise.\nFor, as it happened, I had tossed aside\nThe bit of wool I worked with, carelessly,\n[page 197][696-733]Into the open daylight, ’mid the blaze\nOf Helios’ beam. And, as it kindled warm,\nIt fell away to nothing, crumbled small,\nLike dust in severing wood by sawyers strewn.\nSo, on the point of vanishing, it lay.\nBut, from the place where it had lain, brake forth\nA frothy scum in clots of seething foam,\nLike the rich draught in purple vintage poured\nFrom Bacchus’ vine upon the thirsty ground.\nAnd I, unhappy, know not toward what thought\nTo turn me, but I see mine act is dire.\nFor wherefore should the Centaur, for what end,\nShow kindness to the cause for whom he died?\nThat cannot be. But seeking to destroy\nHis slayer, he cajoled me. This I learn\nToo late, by sad experience, for no good.\nAnd, if I err not now, my hapless fate\nIs all alone to be his murderess.\nFor, well I know, the shaft that made the wound\nGave pain to Cheiron, who was more than man;\nAnd wheresoe’er it falls, it ravageth\nAll the wild creatures of the world. And now\nThis gory venom blackly spreading bane\nFrom Nessus’ angry wound, must it not cause\nThe death of Heracles? I think it must.\nYet my resolve is firm, if aught harm him,\nMy death shall follow in the self-same hour.\nShe cannot bear to live in evil fame,\nWho cares to have a nature pure from ill.\nCH. Horrid mischance must needs occasion fear.\nBut Hope is not condemned before the event.\nDÊ. In ill-advised proceeding not even Hope\nRemains to minister a cheerful mind.\nCH. Yet to have erred unwittingly abates\nThe fire of wrath; and thou art in this case.\nDÊ.

On, then, with my tale!\nWhen after sacking Eurytus’ great city\nHe marched in triumph with first-fruits of war,—\nThere is a headland, last of long Euboea,\nSurf-beat Cenaeum,—where to his father Zeus\nHe dedicates high altars and a grove.\nThere first I saw him, gladdened from desire.\nAnd when he now addressed him to the work\nOf various sacrifice, the herald Lichas\nArrived from home, bearing thy fatal gift,\nThe deadly robe: wherewith invested straight,\nAs thou hadst given charge, he sacrificed\nThe firstlings of the spoil, twelve bulls entire,\nEach after each. But the full count he brought\nWas a clear hundred of all kinds of head.\nThen the all-hapless one commenced his prayer\nIn solemn gladness for the bright array.\nBut presently, when from the holy things,\nAnd from the richness of the oak-tree core,\n[page 199][766-802]There issued flame mingled with blood, a sweat\nRose on his flesh, and close to every limb\nClung, like stone-drapery from the craftsman’s hand,\nThe garment, glued unto his side. Then came\nThe tearing pangs within his bones, and then\nThe poison feasted like the venomed tooth\nOf murderous basilisk.—When this began,\nHe shouted on poor Lichas, none to blame\nFor thy sole crime, ‘What guile is here, thou knave?\nWhat was thy fraud in fetching me this robe?’\nHe, all-unknowing, in an evil hour\nDeclared his message, that the gift was thine.\nWhereat the hero, while the shooting spasm\nHad fastened on the lungs, seized him by the foot\nWhere the ankle turns i’ the socket, and, with a thought,\nHurl’d on a surf-vex’d reef that showed i’ the sea:\nAnd rained the grey pulp from the hair, the brain\nBeing scattered with the blood. Then the great throng\nSaddened their festival with piteous wail\nFor one in death and one in agony.\nAnd none had courage to approach my sire,—\nConvulsed upon the ground, then tossed i’ the air\nWith horrid yells and crying, till the cliffs\nEchoed round, the mountain-promontories\nOf Locris, and Euboea’s rugged shore.\nWearied at length with flinging on the earth,\nAnd shrieking oft with lamentable cry,\nCursing the fatal marriage with thyself\nThe all-wretched, and the bond to Oeneus’ house,\nThat prize that was the poisoner of his peace,\nHe lifted a wild glance above the smoke\nThat hung around, and ’midst the crowd of men\nSaw me in tears, and looked on me and said,\n‘O son, come near; fly not from my distress,\nThough thou shouldst be consumèd in my death,\nBut lift and bear me forth; and, if thou mayest,\nSet me where no one of mankind shall see me.\nBut if thy heart withhold thee, yet convey me\nOut of this land as quickly as ye may.\nLet me not die where I am now.’ We then,\n[page 200][803-833]Thus urgently commanded, laid him down\nWithin our bark, and hardly to this shore\nRowed him convulsed and roaring.—Presently,\nHe will appear, alive or lately dead.\nSuch, mother, is the crime thou hast devised\nAnd done against our sire, wherefore let Right\nAnd Vengeance punish thee!—May I pray so?\nI may: for thou absolv’st me by thy deed,\nThou that hast slain the noblest of the Earth,\nThy spouse, whose like thou ne’er wilt see again.[Exit DÊANIRA.\nCH.

Would that a sudden flood\nMight sweep her far and swiftly from mine eye!\nWhy fondle vainly the fair-sounding name\nOf mother, when her acts are all unmotherly?\nLet her begone for me: and may she find\nSuch joy as she hath rendered to my sire![Exit HYLLUS\nCHORUS.\nSee where falls the doom, of oldI 1\nBy the unerring Voice foretold,—\n‘When twelve troublous years have rolled,\nThen shall end your long desire:\nToil on toil no more shall tire\nThe offspring of the Eternal Sire.’\nLo! the destined Hour is come!\nLo! it hath brought its burden home.\nFor when the eyes have looked their last\nHow should sore labour vex again?\nHow, when the powers of will and thought are past,\nShould life be any more enthralled to pain?\nAnd if Nessus’ withering shroud,I 2\nWrought by destiny and craft,\nSteep him in a poisonous cloud.\nSteaming from the venomed shaft,\n[page 201][834-870]\nWhich to Death in hideous lair\nThe many-wreathed Hydra bare,\nHow shall he another day\nFeel the glad warmth of Helios’ ray?—\nEnfolded by the Monster-Thing\nOf Lerna, while the cruel sting\nOf the shagg’d Centaur’s murderous-guileful tongue\nBreaks forth withal to do him painful wrong.\nAnd she, poor innocent, who sawII 1\nCheckless advancing to the gate\nA mighty harm unto her state,—\nThis rash young bridal without fear of law,—\nGave not her will to aught that caused this woe,\nBut since it came through that strange mind’s conceiving,—\nThat ruined her in meeting,—deeply grieving,\nShe mourns with dewy tears in tenderest flow.\nThe approaching hour appeareth great with woe:\nSome guile-born misery doth Fate foreshow.\nThe springs of sorrow are unbound,II 2\nAnd such an agony disclose,\nAs never from the hands of foes\nTo afflict the life of Heracles was found.\nO dark with battle-stains, world-champion spear,\nThat from Oechalia’s highland leddest then\nThis bride that followed swiftly in thy train,\nHow fatally overshadowing was thy fear!\nBut these wild sorrows all too clearly come\nFrom Love’s dread minister, disguised and dumb.\nCH. 1.

Ay, and in dreadful wise, as thou shalt hear.\nWhen all alone she had gone within the gate,\nAnd passing through the court beheld her boy\nSpreading the couch that should receive his sire,\n[page 203][902-946]Ere he returned to meet him,—out of sight\nShe hid herself, and fell at the altar’s foot,\nAnd loudly cried that she was left forlorn;\nAnd, taking in her touch each household thing\nThat formerly she used, poor lady, wept\nO’er all; and then went ranging through the rooms,\nWhere, if there caught her eye the well-loved form\nOf any of her household, she would gaze\nAnd weep aloud, accusing her own fate\nAnd her abandoned lot, childless henceforth!\nWhen this was ended, suddenly I see her\nFly to the hero’s room of genial rest.\nWith unsuspected gaze o’ershadowed near,\nI watched, and saw her casting on the bed\nThe finest sheets of all. When that was done,\nShe leapt upon the couch where they had lain\nAnd sat there in the midst. And the hot flood\nBurst from her eyes before she spake:—‘Farewell,\nMy bridal bed, for never more shalt thou\nGive me the comfort I have known thee give.’\nThen with tight fingers she undid her robe,\nWhere the brooch lay before the breast, and bared\nAll her left arm and side. I, with what speed\nStrength ministered, ran forth to tell her son\nThe act she was preparing. But meanwhile,\nEre we could come again, the fatal blow\nFell, and we saw the wound. And he, her boy,\nSeeing, wept aloud. For now the hapless youth\nKnew that himself had done this in his wrath,\nTold all too late i’ the house, how she had wrought\nMost innocently, from the Centaur’s wit.\nSo now the unhappy one, with passionate words\nAnd cries and wild embracings of the dead,\nGroaned forth that he had slain her with false breath\nOf evil accusation, and was left\nOrphaned of both, his mother and his sire.\nSuch is the state within. What fool is he\nThat counts one day, or two, or more to come?\nTo-morrow is not, till the present day\nIn fair prosperity have passed away.[Exit\n[page 204][947-975]\nCHORUS.\nWhich shall come first in my wail,I 1\nWhich shall be last to prevail,\nIs a doubt that will never be done.\nTrouble at home may be seen,I 2\nTrouble is looked for with teen;\nAnd to have and to look for are one.\nWould some fair windII 1\nBut waft me forth to roam\nFar from the native region of my home,\nEre death me find, oppressed with wild affright\nEven at the sudden sight\nOf him, the valiant son of Zeus most High!\nBefore the house, they tell, he fareth nigh,\nA wonder beyond thought,\nWith torment unapproachable distraught.\nHark! ...II 2\nThe cause then of my cry\nWas coming all too nigh:\n(Doth the clear nightingale lament for nought?)\nSome step of stranger folk is this way brought.\nAs for a friend they love\nHeavy and slow with noiseless feet they move.\nWhich way? which way?

Many hot toils and hard beyond report,\nWith sturdy thews and sinews I have borne,\nBut no such labour hath the Thunderer’s wife\nOr sour Eurystheus ever given, as this,\nWhich Oeneus’ daughter of the treacherous eye\nHath fastened on my back, this amply-woven\nNet of the Furies, that is breaking me.\nFor, glued unto my side, it hath devoured\nMy flesh to the bone, and lodging in the lungs\nIt drains the vital channels, and hath drunk\nThe fresh life-blood, and ruins all my frame,\nFoiled in the tangle of a viewless bond.\nYet me nor War-host, nor Earth’s giant brood,\nNor Centaur’s monstrous violence could subdue,\nNor Hellas, nor the Stranger, nor all lands\nWhere I have gone, cleansing the world from harms.\nBut a soft woman without manhood’s strain\nAlone and weaponless hath conquered me.\nSon, let me know thee mine true-born, nor rate\nThy mother’s claim beyond thy sire’s, but bring\nThyself from out the chambers to my hand\nHer body that hath borne thee, that my heart\nMay be assured, if lesser than my pain\nIt will distress thee to behold her limbs\nWith righteous torment agonized and torn.\nNay, shrink not, son, but pity me, whom all\nMay pity—me, who, like a tender girl,\nAm heard to weep aloud!

O Hellas, how I grieve for thy distress!\nHow thou wilt mourn in losing him we see!\nHYL. My father, since thy silence gives me leave,\nStill hear me patiently, though in thy pain!\nFor my request is just. Lend me thy mind\n[page 209][1117-1149]Less wrathfully distempered than ’tis now;\nElse thou canst never know, where thou art keen\nWith vain resentment and with vain desire\nHER. Speak what thou wilt and cease, for I in pain\nCatch not the sense of thy mysterious talk\nHYL. I come to tell thee of my mother’s case,\nAnd her involuntary unconscious fault.\nHER. Base villain! hast thou breathed thy mother’s name,\nThy father’s murderess, in my hearing too!\nHYL. Her state requires not silence, but full speech.\nHER. Her faults in former time might well be told.\nHYL. So might her fault to day, couldst thou but know.\nHER. Speak, but beware base words disgrace thee not.\nHYL. List! She is dead even now with new-given wound.\nHER. By whom? Thy words flash wonder through my woe.\nHYL. Her own hand slaughtered her, no foreign stroke.\nHER. Wretch! to have reft this office from my hands.\nHYL. Even your rash spirit were softened, if you knew.\nHER. This bodes some knavery. But declare thy thought!\nHYL. She erred with good intent. The whole is said.\nHER. Good, O thou villain, to destroy thy sire!\nHYL. When she perceived that marriage in her home,\nShe erred, supposing to enchain thy love.\nHER. Hath Trachis a magician of such might?\nHYL. Long since the Centaur Nessus moved her mind\nTo work this charm for heightening thy desire.\nHER. O horror, thou art here! I am no more.\nMy day is darkened, boy! Undone, undone!\nI see our plight too plainly. woe is me!\nCome, O my son! —thou hast no more a father,—\nCall to me all the brethren of thy blood,\nAnd poor Alcmena, wedded all in vain\n[page 210][1149-1185]Unto the Highest, that ye may hear me tell\nWith my last breath what prophecies I know.\nHYL. Thy mother is not here, but by the shore\nOf Tiryns hath obtained a dwelling-place;\nAnd of thy sons, some she hath with her there,\nAnd some inhabit Thebè’s citadel.\nBut we who are with thee, sire, if there be aught\nThat may by us be done, will hear, and do.\nHER. Then hearken thou unto this task, and show\nIf worthily thou art reputed mine.\nNow is time to prove thee. My great father\nForewarned me long ago that I should die\nBy none who lived and breathed, but from the will\nOf one now dwelling in the house of death.\nAnd so this Centaur, as the voice Divine\nThen prophesied, in death hath slain me living.\nAnd in agreement with that ancient word\nI now interpret newer oracles\nWhich I wrote down on going within the grove\nOf the hill-roving and earth-couching Selli,—\nDictated to me by the mystic tongue\nInnumerous, of my Father’s sacred tree;\nDeclaring that my ever instant toils\nShould in the time that new hath being and life\nEnd and release me. And I look’d for joy.\nBut the true meaning plainly was my death.—\nNo labour is appointed for the dead.—\nThen, since all argues one event, my son,\nOnce more thou must befriend me, and not wait\nFor my voice goading thee, but of thyself\nSubmit and second my resolve, and know\nFilial obedience for thy noblest rule.\nHYL. I will obey thee, father, though my heart\nSinks heavily in approaching such a theme.\nHER. Before aught else, lay thy right hand in mine.\nHYL. Why so intent on this assurance, sire?\nHER. Give it at once and be not froward, boy.\nHYL. There is my hand: I will gainsay thee nought.\nHER. Swear by the head of him who gave me life.\n[page 211][1186-1221]HYL. Tell me the oath, and I will utter it.\nHER. Swear thou wilt do the thing I bid thee do.\nHYL. I swear, and make Zeus witness of my troth.\nHER. But if you swerve, pray that the curse may come.\nHYL. It will not come for swerving:—but I pray.\nHER. Now, dost thou know on Oeta’s topmost height\nThe crag of Zeus?\nHYL. I know it, and full oft\nHave stood there sacrificing.\nHER. Then even there,\nWith thine own hand uplifting this my body,\nTaking what friends thou wilt, and having lopped\nMuch wood from the deep-rooted oak and rough\nWild olive, lay me on the gathered pile,\nAnd burn all with the touch of pine-wood flame.\nLet not a tear of mourning dim thine eye;\nBut silent, with dry gaze, if thou art mine,\nPerform it. Else my curse awaits thee still\nTo weigh thee down when I am lost in night.\nHYL. How cruel, O my father, is thy tongue!\nHER. ’Tis peremptory. Else, if thou refuse,\nBe called another’s and be no more mine.\nHYL. Alas that thou shouldst challenge me to this,\nTo be thy murderer, guilty of thy blood!\nHER. Not I, in sooth: but healer of my pain,\nAnd sole preserver from a life of woe.\nHYL. How can it heal to burn thee on the pyre?\nHER. If this act frighten thee, perform the rest.\nHYL. Mine arms shall not refuse to carry thee.\nHER. And wilt thou gather the appointed wood?\nHYL. So my hand fire it not. In all but this,\nNot scanting labour, I will do my part.\nHER. Enough. ’Tis well. And having thus much given\nAdd one small kindness to a list so full.\nHYL. How great soe’er it were, it should be done.\nHER. The maid of Eurytus thou knowest, I ween.\nHYL. Of Iolè thou speak’st, or I mistake.\nHER. Of her. This then is all I urge, my son.\n[page 212][1222-1258]When I am dead, if thou wouldst show thy duty,\nThink of thine oath to me, and, on my word,\nMake her thy wife: nor let another man\nTake her, but only thou; since she hath lain\nSo near this heart. Obey me, O my boy!\nAnd be thyself the maker of this bond.\nTo spurn at trifles after great things given,\nWere to confound the meed already won.\nHYL. Oh, anger is not right, when men are ill!\nBut who could bear to see thee in this mind?\nHER. You murmur, as you meant to disobey.\nHYL. How can I do it, when my mother’s death\nAnd thy sad state sprang solely from this girl?\nWho, not possessed with furies, could choose this?\nFar better, father, for me too to die,\nThan to live still with my worst enemy.\nHER. This youth withdraws his reverence in my death.\nBut, if thou yield’st not to thy father’s best,\nThe curse from Heaven shall dog thy footsteps still.\nHYL. Ah! thou wilt tell me that thy pain is come.\nHER. Yea, for thou wak’st the torment that had slept.\nHYL. Ay me! how cross and doubtful is my way!\nHER. Because you will reject your father’s word.\nHYL. Must I be taught impiety from thee?\nHER. It is not impious to content my heart.\nHYL. Then you require this with an absolute will?\nHER. And bid Heaven witness to my strong command.\nHYL. Then I will do it, for the act is thine.\nI will not cast it off. Obeying thee,\nMy sire, the Gods will ne’er reprove my deed.\nHER. Thou endest fairly. Now, then, O my son,\nAdd the performance swiftly, that, before\nSome spasm or furious onset of my pain\nHave seized me, ye may place me on the pyre.\nCome, loiter not, but lift me. Now my end\nIs near, the last cessation of my woe.\nHYL. Since thy command is urgent, O my sire!\nWe tarry not, but bear thee to the pyre.\n[page 213][1259-1278]HER. Stubborn heart, ere yet again\nWakes the fierce rebound of pain,\nWhile the evil holds aloof,\nThou, with bit of diamond proof,\nCurb thy cry, with forcèd will\nSeeming to do gladly still!\nHYL. Lift him, men, and hate not me\nFor the evil deeds ye see,\nSince the Heavens’ relentless sway\nRecks not of the righteous way.\nHe who gave life and doth claim\nFrom his seed a Father’s name\nCan behold this hour of blame.\nThough the future none can tell,\nYet the present is not well:\nSore for him who bears the blow,\nSad for us who feel his woe,\nShameful to the Gods, we trow.\nCH. Maidens from the palace-hall,\nCome ye forth, too, at our call!\nMighty deaths beyond belief,\nMany an unknown form of grief,\nYe have seen to-day; and nought\nBut the power of Zeus hath wrought.",

Sophocles was first, Euripides second with the Cretan Women, Alcmaeon in Psophis, Telephus and Alcestis…. The play is somewhat Satyric in character.'\nALCESTIS\nThe scene represents the ancient Castle of ADMETUS near Pherae in Thessaly. It is the dusk before dawn; APOLLO, radiant in the darkness, looks at the Castle.\nAPOLLO.\nAdmetus' House! 'Twas here I bowed my head\nOf old, and chafed not at the bondman's bread,\nThough born in heaven. Aye, Zeus to death had hurled\nMy son, Asclepios, Healer of the World,\nPiercing with fire his heart; and in mine ire\nI slew his Cyclop churls, who forged the fire.\nWhereat Zeus cast me forth to bear the yoke\nOf service to a mortal. To this folk\nI came, and watched a stranger's herd for pay,\nAnd all his house I have prospered to this day.\nFor innocent was the Lord I chanced upon\nAnd clean as mine own heart, King Pheres' son,\nAdmetus. Him I rescued from the grave,\nBeguiling the Grey Sisters till they gave\nA great oath that Admetus should go free,\nWould he but pay to Them Below in fee\nAnother living soul. Long did he prove\nAll that were his, and all that owed him love,\nBut never a soul he found would yield up life\nAnd leave the sunlight for him, save his wife:\nWho, even now, down the long galleries\nIs borne, death-wounded; for this day it is\nShe needs must pass out of the light and die.\nAnd, seeing the stain of death must not come nigh\nMy radiance, I must leave this house I love.\nBut ha! The Headsman of the Pit, above\nEarth's floor, to ravish her! Aye, long and late\nHe hath watched, and cometh at the fall of fate.\nEnter from the other side THANATOS; a crouching black-haired and winged figure, carrying a drawn sword. He starts in revulsion on seeing APOLLO.\nTHANATOS.\nAha!\nWhy here? What mak'st thou at the gate,\nThou Thing of Light? Wilt overtread\nThe eternal judgment, and abate\nAnd spoil the portions of the dead?\n'Tis not enough for thee to have blocked\nIn other days Admetus' doom\nWith craft of magic wine, which mocked\nThe three grey Sisters of the Tomb;\nBut now once more\nI see thee stand at watch, and shake\nThat arrow-armèd hand to make\nThis woman thine, who swore, who swore,\nTo die now for her husband's sake.\nAPOLLO.\nFear not.\nI bring fair words and seek but what is just.\nTHANATOS (sneering)\nAnd if words help thee not, an arrow must?\nAPOLLO.\n'Tis ever my delight to bear this bow.\nTHANATOS.\nAnd aid this house unjustly? Aye, 'tis so.\nAPOLLO.\nI love this man, and grieve for his dismay.\nTHANATOS.\nAnd now wilt rob me of my second prey!\nAPOLLO.\nI never robbed thee, neither then nor now.\nTHANATOS.\nWhy is Admetus here then, not below?\nAPOLLO.\nHe gave for ransom his own wife, for whom …\nTHANATOS (interrupting).\nI am come; and straight will bear her to the tomb.\nAPOLLO.\nGo, take her.—I can never move thine heart.\nTHANATOS (mocking).\nTo slay the doomed?—Nay; I will do my part.\nAPOLLO.\nNo. To keep death for them that linger late.\nTHANATOS (still mocking).\n'Twould please thee, so?… I owe thee homage great.\nAPOLLO.\nAh, then she may yet … she may yet grow old?\nTHANATOS (with a laugh).\nNo!… I too have my rights, and them I hold.\nAPOLLO.\n'Tis but one life thou gainest either-wise.\nTHANATOS.\nWhen young souls die, the richer is my prize.\nAPOLLO.\nOld, with great riches they will bury her.\nTHANATOS.\nFie on thee, fie! Thou rich-man's lawgiver!\nAPOLLO.\nHow? Is there wit in Death, who seemed so blind?\nTHANATOS.\nThe rich would buy long life for all their kind.\nAPOLLO.\nThou will not grant me, then, this boon? 'Tis so?\nTHANATOS.\nThou knowest me, what I am: I tell thee, no!\nAPOLLO.\nI know gods sicken at thee and men pine.\nTHANATOS.\nBegone! Too many things not meant for thine\nThy greed hath conquered; but not all, not all!\nAPOLLO.\nI swear, for all thy bitter pride, a fall\nAwaits thee. One even now comes conquering\nTowards this house, sent by a southland king\nTo fetch him four wild coursers, of the race\nWhich rend men's bodies in the winds of Thrace.\nThis house shall give him welcome good, and he\nShall wrest this woman from thy worms and thee.\nSo thou shalt give me all, and thereby win\nBut hatred, not the grace that might have been.\n[Exit APOLLO.]\nTHANATOS.\nTalk on, talk on! Thy threats shall win no bride\nFrom me.—This woman, whatsoe'er betide,\nShall lie in Hades' house. Even at the word\nI go to lay upon her hair my sword.\nFor all whose head this grey sword visiteth\nTo death are hallowed and the Lords of death.\n[THANATOS goes into the house. Presently, as the day grows lighter, the CHORUS enters: it consists of Citizens of Pherae, who speak severally.]\nCHORUS.\nLEADER.\nQuiet, quiet, above, beneath!\nSECOND ELDER.\nThe house of Admetus holds its breath.\nTHIRD ELDER.\nAnd never a King's friend near,\nTo tell us either of tears to shed\nFor Pelias' daughter, crowned and dead;\nOr joy, that her eyes are clear.\nBravest, truest of wives is she\nThat I have seen or the world shall see.\nDIVERS CITIZENS, conversing.\n(The dash — indicates a new speaker.)\n—Hear ye no sob, or noise of hands\nBeating the breast? No mourners' cries\nFor one they cannot save?\n—Nothing: and at the door there stands\nNo handmaid.—Help, O Paian; rise,\nO star beyond the wave!\n—Dead, and this quiet? No, it cannot be.\n—Dead, dead!—Not gone to burial secretly!\n—Why? I still fear: what makes your speech so brave?\n—Admetus cast that dear wife to the grave\nAlone, with none to see?\n—I see no bowl of clear spring water.\nIt ever stands before the dread\nDoor where a dead man rests.\n—No lock of shorn hair! Every daughter\nOf woman shears it for the dead.\nNo sound of bruisèd breasts!\n—Yet 'tis this very day …—This very day?\n—The Queen should pass and lie beneath the clay.\n—It hurts my life, my heart!—All honest hearts\nMust sorrow for a brightness that departs,\nA good life worn away.\nLEADER.\nTo wander o'er leagues of land,\nTo search over wastes of sea,\nWhere the Prophets of Lycia stand,\nOr where Ammon's daughters three\nMake runes in the rainless sand,\nFor magic to make her free—\nAh, vain! for the end is here;\nSudden it comes and sheer.\nWhat lamb on the altar-strand\nStricken shall comfort me?\nSECOND ELDER.\nOnly, only one, I know:\nApollo's son was he,\nWho healed men long ago.\nWere he but on earth to see,\nShe would rise from the dark below\nAnd the gates of eternity.\nFor men whom the Gods had slain\nHe pitied and raised again;\nTill God's fire laid him low,\nAnd now, what help have we?\nOTHERS.\nAll's done that can be. Every vow\nFull paid; and every altar's brow\nFull crowned with spice of sacrifice.\nNo help remains nor respite now.\nEnter from the Castle a HANDMAID, almost in tears.\nLEADER.\nBut see, a handmaid cometh, and the tear\nWet on her cheek! What tiding shall we hear?…\nThy grief is natural, daughter, if some ill\nHath fallen to-day. Say, is she living still\nOr dead, your mistress? Speak, if speak you may.\nMAID.\nAlive. No, dead…. Oh, read it either way.\nLEADER.\nNay, daughter, can the same soul live and die?\nMAID.\nHer life is broken; death is in her eye.\nLEADER.\nPoor King, to think what she was, and what thou!\nMAID.\nHe never knew her worth…. He will know it now.\nLEADER.\nThere is no hope, methinks, to save her still?\nMAID.\nThe hour is come, and breaks all human will.\nLEADER.\nShe hath such tendance as the dying crave?\nMAID.\nFor sure: and rich robes ready for her grave.\nLEADER.\n'Fore God, she dies high-hearted, aye, and far\nIn honour raised above all wives that are!\nMAID.\nFar above all! How other? What must she,\nWho seeketh to surpass this woman, be?\nOr how could any wife more shining make\nHer lord's love, than by dying for his sake?\nBut thus much all the city knows. 'Tis here,\nIn her own rooms, the tale will touch thine ear\nWith strangeness. When she knew the day was come,\nShe rose and washed her body, white as foam,\nWith running water; then the cedarn press\nShe opened, and took forth her funeral dress\nAnd rich adornment. So she stood arrayed\nBefore the Hearth-Fire of her home, and prayed:\n'Mother, since I must vanish from the day,\nThis last, last time I kneel to thee and pray;\nBe mother to my two children! Find some dear\nHelpmate for him, some gentle lord for her.\nAnd let not them, like me, before their hour\nDie; let them live in happiness, in our\nOld home, till life be full and age content.'\nTo every household altar then she went\nAnd made for each his garland of the green\nBoughs of the wind-blown myrtle, and was seen\nPraying, without a sob, without a tear.\nShe knew the dread thing coming, but her clear\nCheek never changed: till suddenly she fled\nBack to her own chamber and bridal bed:\nThen came the tears and she spoke all her thought.\n'O bed, whereon my laughing girlhood's knot\nWas severed by this man, for whom I die,\nFarewell! 'Tis thou … I speak not bitterly….\n'Tis thou hast slain me. All alone I go\nLest I be false to him or thee. And lo,\nSome woman shall lie here instead of me—\nHappier perhaps; more true she cannot be.'\nShe kissed the pillow as she knelt, and wet\nWith flooding tears was that fair coverlet.\nAt last she had had her fill of weeping; then\nShe tore herself away, and rose again,\nWalking with downcast eyes; yet turned before\nShe had left the room, and cast her down once more\nKneeling beside the bed. Then to her side\nThe children came, and clung to her and cried,\nAnd her arms hugged them, and a long good-bye\nShe gave to each, like one who goes to die.\nThe whole house then was weeping, every slave\nIn sorrow for his mistress. And she gave\nHer hand to all; aye, none so base was there\nShe gave him not good words and he to her.\nSo on Admetus falls from either side\nSorrow. 'Twere bitter grief to him to have died\nHimself; and being escaped, how sore a woe\nHe hath earned instead—Ah, some day he shall know!\nLEADER.\nSurely Admetus suffers, even to-day,\nFor this true-hearted love he hath cast away?\nMAID.\nHe weeps; begs her not leave him desolate,\nAnd holds her to his heart—too late, too late!\nShe is sinking now, and there, beneath his eye\nFading, the poor cold hand falls languidly,\nAnd faint is all her breath. Yet still she fain\nWould look once on the sunlight—once again\nAnd never more. I will go in and tell\nThy presence. Few there be, will serve so well\nMy master and stand by him to the end.\nBut thou hast been from olden days our friend.\n[The MAID goes in.]\nCHORUS.\nTHIRD ELDER.\nO Zeus,\nWhat escape and where\nFrom the evil thing?\nHow break the snare\nThat is round our King?\nSECOND ELDER.\nAh list!\nOne cometh?… No.\nLet us no more wait;\nMake dark our raiment\nAnd shear this hair.\nLEADER.\nAye, friends!\n'Tis so, even so.\nYet the gods are great\nAnd may send allayment.\nTo prayer, to prayer!\nALL (praying).\nO Paian wise!\nSome healing of this home devise, devise!\nFind, find…. Oh, long ago when we were blind\nThine eyes saw mercy … find some healing breath!\nAgain, O Paian, break the chains that bind;\nStay the red hand of Death!\nLEADER.\nAlas!\nWhat shame, what dread,\nThou Pheres' son,\nShalt be harvested\nWhen thy wife is gone!\nSECOND ELDER.\nAh me;\nFor a deed less drear\nThan this thou ruest\nMen have died for sorrow;\nAye, hearts have bled.\nTHIRD ELDER.\n'Tis she;\nNot as men say dear,\nBut the dearest, truest,\nShall lie ere morrow\nBefore thee dead!\nALL.\nBut lo! Once more!\nShe and her husband moving to the door!\nCry, cry! And thou, O land of Pherae, hearken!\nThe bravest of women sinketh, perisheth,\nUnder the green earth, down where the shadows darken,\nDown to the House of Death!\n[During the last words ADMETUS and ALCESTIS have entered. ALCESTIS is supported by her Handmaids and followed by her two children.]\nLEADER.\nAnd who hath said that Love shall bring\nMore joy to man than fear and strife?\nI knew his perils from of old,\nI know them now, when I behold\nThe bitter faring of my King,\nWhose love is taken, and his life\nLeft evermore an empty thing.\nALCESTIS.\nO Sun, O light of the day that falls!\nO running cloud that races along the sky!\nADMETUS.\nThey look on thee and me, a stricken twain,\nWho have wrought no sin that God should have thee slain.\nALCESTIS.\nDear Earth, and House of sheltering walls,\nAnd wedded homes of the land where my fathers lie!\nADMETUS.\nFail not, my hapless one. Be strong, and pray\nThe o'er-mastering Gods to hate us not alway.\nALCESTIS (faintly, her mind wandering).\nA boat two-oared, upon water; I see, I see.\nAnd the Ferryman of the Dead,\nHis hand that hangs on the pole, his voice that cries;\n'Thou lingerest; come. Come quickly, we wait for thee.'\nHe is angry that I am slow; he shakes his head.\nADMETUS.\nAlas, a bitter boat-faring for me,\nMy bride ill-starred.—Oh, this is misery!\nALCESTIS (as before).\nDrawing, drawing! 'Tis some one that draweth me …\nTo the Palaces of the Dead.\nSo dark. The wings, the eyebrows and ah, the eyes!…\nGo back! God's mercy! What seekest thou? Let me be!…\n(Recovering) Where am I? Ah, and what paths are these I tread?\nADMETUS.\nGrievous for all who love thee, but for me\nAnd my two babes most hard, most solitary.\nALCESTIS.\nHold me not; let me lie.—\nI am too weak to stand; and Death is near,\nAnd a slow darkness stealing on my sight.\nMy little ones, good-bye.\nSoon, soon, and mother will be no more here….\nGood-bye, two happy children in the light.\nADMETUS.\nOh, word of pain, oh, sharper ache\nThan any death of mine had brought!\nFor the Gods' sake, desert me not,\nFor thine own desolate children's sake.\nNay, up! Be brave. For if they rend\nThee from me, I can draw no breath;\nIn thy hand are my life and death,\nThine, my belovèd and my friend!\nALCESTIS.\nAdmetus, seeing what way my fortunes lie,\nI fain would speak with thee before I die.\nI have set thee before all things; yea, mine own\nLife beside thine was naught. For this alone\nI die…. Dear Lord, I never need have died.\nI might have lived to wed some prince of pride,\nDwell in a king's house…. Nay, how could I, torn\nFrom thee, live on, I and my babes forlorn?\nI have given to thee my youth—not more nor less,\nBut all—though I was full of happiness.\nThy father and mother both—'tis strange to tell—\nHad failed thee, though for them the deed was well,\nThe years were ripe, to die and save their son,\nThe one child of the house: for hope was none,\nIf thou shouldst pass away, of other heirs.\nSo thou and I had lived through the long years,\nBoth. Thou hadst not lain sobbing here alone\nFor a dead wife and orphan babes…. 'Tis done\nNow, and some God hath wrought out all his will.\nHowbeit I now will ask thee to fulfill\nOne great return-gift—not so great withal\nAs I have given, for life is more than all;\nBut just and due, as thine own heart will tell.\nFor thou hast loved our little ones as well\nAs I have…. Keep them to be masters here\nIn my old house; and bring no stepmother\nUpon them. She might hate them. She might be\nSome baser woman, not a queen like me,\nAnd strike them with her hand. For mercy, spare\nOur little ones that wrong. It is my prayer….\nThey come into a house: they are all strife\nAnd hate to any child of the dead wife….\nBetter a serpent than a stepmother!\nA boy is safe. He has his father there\nTo guard him. But a little girl! (Taking the LITTLE GIRL\nto her) What good\nAnd gentle care will guide thy maidenhood?\nWhat woman wilt thou find at father's side?\nOne evil word from her, just when the tide\nOf youth is full, would wreck thy hope of love.\nAnd no more mother near, to stand above\nThy marriage-bed, nor comfort thee pain-tossed\nIn travail, when one needs a mother most!\nSeeing I must die…. 'Tis here, across my way,\nNot for the morrow, not for the third day,\nBut now—Death, and to lie with things that were.\nFarewell. God keep you happy.—Husband dear,\nRemember that I failed thee not; and you,\nMy children, that your mother loved you true.\nLEADER.\nTake comfort. Ere thy lord can speak, I swear,\nIf truth is in him, he will grant thy prayer.\nADMETUS.\nHe will, he will! Oh, never fear for me.\nMine hast thou been, and mine shalt ever be,\nLiving and dead, thou only. None in wide\nHellas but thou shalt be Admetus' bride.\nNo race so high, no face so magic-sweet\nShall ever from this purpose turn my feet.\nAnd children … if God grant me joy of these,\n'Tis all I ask; of thee no joy nor ease\nHe gave me. And thy mourning I will bear\nNot one year of my life but every year,\nWhile life shall last…. My mother I will know\nNo more. My father shall be held my foe.\nThey brought the words of love but not the deed,\nWhile thou hast given thine all, and in my need\nSaved me. What can I do but weep alone,\nAlone alway, when such a wife is gone?…\nAn end shall be of revel, and an end\nOf crowns and song and mirth of friend with friend,\nWherewith my house was glad. I ne'er again\nWill touch the lute nor ease my heart from pain\nWith pipes of Afric. All the joys I knew,\nAnd joys were many, thou hast broken in two.\nOh, I will find some artist wondrous wise\nShall mould for me thy shape, thine hair, thine eyes,\nAnd lay it in thy bed; and I will lie\nClose, and reach out mine arms to thee, and cry\nThy name into the night, and wait and hear\nMy own heart breathe: 'Thy love, thy love is near.'\nA cold delight; yet it might ease the sum\nOf sorrow…. And good dreams of thee will come\nLike balm. 'Tis sweet, even in a dream, to gaze\nOn a dear face, the moment that it stays.\nO God, if Orpheus' voice were mine, to sing\nTo Death's high Virgin and the Virgin's King,\nTill their hearts failed them, down would I my path\nCleave, and naught stay me, not the Hound of Wrath,\nNot the grey oarsman of the ghostly tide,\nTill back to sunlight I had borne my bride.\nBut now, wife, wait for me till I shall come\nWhere thou art, and prepare our second home.\nThese ministers in that same cedar sweet\nWhere thou art laid will lay me, feet to feet,\nAnd head to head, oh, not in death from thee\nDivided, who alone art true to me!\nLEADER.\nThis life-long sorrow thou hast sworn, I too,\nThy friend, will bear with thee. It is her due.\nALCESTIS.\nChildren, ye heard his promise? He will wed\nNo other woman nor forget the dead.\nADMETUS.\nAgain I promise. So it shall be done.\nALCESTIS (giving the children into his arms one after the other).\nOn that oath take my daughter: and my son.\nADMETUS.\nDear hand that gives, I accept both gift and vow.\nALCESTIS.\nThou, in my place, must be their mother now.\nADMETUS.\nElse were they motherless—I needs must try.\nALCESTIS.\nMy babes, I ought to live, and lo, I die.\nADMETUS.\nAnd how can I, forlorn of thee, live on?\nALCESTIS.\nTime healeth; and the dead are dead and gone.\nADMETUS.\nOh, take me with thee to the dark below,\nMe also!\nALCESTIS.\n'Tis enough that one should go.\nADMETUS.\nO Fate, to have cheated me of one so true!\nALCESTIS (her strength failing).\nThere comes a darkness: a great burden, too.\nADMETUS.\nI am lost if thou wilt leave me…. Wife! Mine own!\nALCESTIS.\nI am not thy wife; I am nothing. All is gone.\nADMETUS.\nThy babes! Thou wilt not leave them.—Raise thine eye.\nALCESTIS.\nI am sorry…. But good-bye, children; good-bye.\nADMETUS.\nLook at them! Wake and look at them!\nALCESTIS.\nI must go.\nADMETUS.\nWhat? Dying!\nALCESTIS.\nFarewell, husband! [She dies.]\nADMETUS (with a cry).\nAh!… Woe, woe!\nLEADER.\nAdmetus' Queen is dead!\n[While ADMETUS is weeping silently, and the CHORUS veil their faces, the LITTLE BOY runs up to his dead Mother.]\nLITTLE BOY.\nOh, what has happened? Mummy has gone away,\nAnd left me and will not come back any more!\nFather, I shall be lonely all the day….\nLook! Look! Her eyes … and her arms not like before,\nHow they lie …\nMother! Oh, speak a word!\nAnswer me, answer me, Mother! It is I.\nI am touching your face. It is I, your little bird.\nADMETUS (recovering himself and going to the Child).\nShe hears us not, she sees us not. We lie\nUnder a heavy grief, child, thou and I.\nLITTLE BOY.\nI am so little, Father, and lonely and cold\nHere without Mother. It is too hard…. And you,\nPoor little sister, too.\nOh, Father!\nSuch a little time we had her. She might have stayed\nOn till we all were old….\nEverything is spoiled when Mother is dead.\n[The LITTLE BOY is taken away, with his Sister, sobbing.]\nLEADER.\nMy King, thou needs must gird thee to the worst.\nThou shalt not be the last, nor yet the first,\nTo lose a noble wife. Be brave, and know\nTo die is but a debt that all men owe.\nADMETUS.\nI know. It came not without doubts and fears,\nThis thing. The thought hath poisoned all my years.\nHowbeit, I now will make the burial due\nTo this dead Queen. Be assembled, all of you;\nAnd, after, raise your triumph-song to greet\nThis pitiless Power that yawns beneath our feet.\nMeantime let all in Thessaly who dread\nMy sceptre join in mourning for the dead\nWith temples sorrow-shorn and sable weed.\nYe chariot-lords, ye spurrers of the steed,\nShear close your horses' manes! Let there be found\nThrough all my realm no lute, nor lyre, nor sound\nOf piping, till twelve moons are at an end.\nFor never shall I lose a closer friend,\nNor braver in my need. And worthy is she\nOf honour, who alone hath died for me.\n[The body of ALCESTIS is carried into the house by mourners; ADMETUS follows it.]\nCHORUS.\nDaughter of Pelias, fare thee well,\nMay joy be thine in the Sunless Houses!\nFor thine is a deed which the Dead shall tell\nWhere a King black-browed in the gloom carouses;\nAnd the cold grey hand at the helm and oar\nWhich guideth shadows from shore to shore,\nShall bear this day o'er the Tears that Well,\nA Queen of women, a spouse of spouses.\nMinstrels many shall praise thy name\nWith lyre full-strung and with voices lyreless,\nWhen Mid-Moon riseth, an orbèd flame,\nAnd from dusk to dawning the dance is tireless;\nAnd Carnos cometh to Sparta's call,\nAnd Athens shineth in festival;\nFor thy death is a song, and a fullness of fame,\nTill the heart of the singer is left desireless.\nLEADER.\nWould I could reach thee, oh,\nReach thee and save, my daughter,\nStarward from gulfs of Hell,\nPast gates, past tears that swell,\nWhere the weak oar climbs thro'\nThe night and the water!\nSECOND ELDER.\nBelovèd and lonely one,\nWho feared not dying:\nGone in another's stead\nAlone to the hungry dead:\nLight be the carven stone\nAbove thee lying!\nTHIRD ELDER.\nOh, he who should seek again\nA new bride after thee,\nWere loathed of thy children twain,\nAnd loathed of me.\nLEADER.\nWord to his mother sped,\nPraying to her who bore him;\nWord to his father, old,\nHeavy with years and cold;\n'Quick, ere your son be dead!\nWhat dare ye for him?'\nSECOND ELDER.\nOld, and they dared not; grey,\nAnd they helped him never!\n'Twas she, in her youth and pride,\nRose up for her lord and died.\nOh, love of two hearts that stay\nOne-knit for ever….\nTHIRD ELDER.\n'Tis rare in the world! God send\nSuch bride in my house to be;\nShe should live life to the end,\nNot fail through me.\n[As the song ceases there enters a stranger, walking strongly, but travel-stained, dusty, and tired. His lion-skin and club show him to be HERACLES.]\nHERACLES.\nHo, countrymen! To Pherae am I come\nBy now? And is Admetus in his home?\nLEADER.\nOur King is in his house, Lord Heracles.—\nBut say, what need brings thee in days like these\nTo Thessaly and Pherae's wallèd ring?\nHERACLES.\nA quest I follow for the Argive King.\nLEADER.\nWhat prize doth call thee, and to what far place?\nHERACLES.\nThe horses of one Diomede, in Thrace.\nLEADER.\nBut how…? Thou know'st not? Is he strange to thee?\nHERACLES.\nQuite strange. I ne'er set foot in Bistony.\nLEADER.\nNot without battle shalt thou win those steeds.\nHERACLES.\nSo be it! I cannot fail my master's needs.\nLEADER.\n'Tis slay or die, win or return no more.\nHERACLES.\nWell, I have looked on peril's face before.\nLEADER.\nWhat profit hast thou in such manslaying?\nHERACLES.\nI shall bring back the horses to my King.\nLEADER.\n'Twere none such easy work to bridle them.\nHERACLES.\nNot easy? Have they nostrils breathing flame?\nLEADER.\nThey tear men's flesh; their jaws are swift with blood.\nHERACLES.\nMen's flesh! 'Tis mountain wolves', not horses' food!\nLEADER.\nThou wilt see their mangers clogged with blood, like mire.\nHERACLES.\nAnd he who feeds such beasts, who was his sire?\nLEADER.\nAres, the war-lord of the Golden Targe.\nHERACLES.\nEnough!—This labour fitteth well my large\nFortune, still upward, still against the wind.\nHow often with these kings of Ares' kind\nMust I do battle? First the dark wolf-man,\nLycaon; then 'twas he men called The Swan;\nAnd now this man of steeds!… Well, none shall see\nAlcmena's son turn from his enemy.\nLEADER.\nLo, as we speak, this land's high governor,\nAdmetus, cometh from his castle door.\nEnter ADMETUS from the Castle.\nADMETUS.\nZeus-born of Perseid line, all joy to thee!\nHERACLES.\nJoy to Admetus, Lord of Thessaly!\nADMETUS.\nRight welcome were she!—But thy love I know.\nHERACLES.\nBut why this mourning hair, this garb of woe?\nADMETUS (in a comparatively light tone).\nThere is a burial I must make to-day.\nHERACLES.\nGod keep all evil from thy children!\nADMETUS.\nNay,\nMy children live.\nHERACLES.\nThy father, if 'tis he,\nIs ripe in years.\nADMETUS.\nHe liveth, friend, and she\nWho bore me.\nHERACLES.\nSurely not thy wife? 'Tis not\nAlcestis?\nADMETUS (his composure a little shaken).\nAh; two answers share my thought,\nQuestioned of her.\nHERACLES.\nIs she alive or dead?\nADMETUS.\nShe is, and is not; and my heart hath bled\nLong years for her.\nHERACLES.\nI understand no more.\nThy words are riddles.\nADMETUS.\nHeard'st thou not of yore\nThe doom that she must meet?\nHERACLES.\nI know thy wife\nHas sworn to die for thee.\nADMETUS.\nAnd is it life,\nTo live with such an oath hung o'er her head?\nHERACLES (relieved).\nAh,\nWeep not too soon, friend. Wait till she be dead.\nADMETUS.\nHe dies who is doomed to die; he is dead who dies.\nHERACLES.\nThe two are different things in most men's eyes.\nADMETUS.\nDecide thy way, lord, and let me decide\nThe other way.\nHERACLES.\nWho is it that has died?\nThou weepest.\nADMETUS.\n'Tis a woman. It doth take\nMy memory back to her of whom we spake.\nHERACLES.\nA stranger, or of kin to thee?\nADMETUS.\nNot kin,\nBut much beloved.\nHERACLES.\nHow came she to be in\nThy house to die?\nADMETUS.\nHer father died, and so\nShe came to us, an orphan, long ago.\nHERACLES (as though about to depart).\n'Tis sad.\nI would I had found thee on a happier day.\nADMETUS.\nThy words have some intent: what wouldst thou say?\nHERACLES.\nI must find harbour with some other friend.\nADMETUS.\nMy prince, it may not be! God never send\nSuch evil!\nHERACLES.\n'Tis great turmoil, when a guest\nComes to a mourning house.\nADMETUS.\nCome in and rest.\nLet the dead die!\nHERACLES.\nI cannot, for mere shame,\nFeast beside men whose eyes have tears in them.\nADMETUS.\nThe guest-rooms are apart where thou shalt be.\nHERACLES.\nFriend, let me go. I shall go gratefully.\nADMETUS.\nThou shalt not enter any door but mine.\n(To an Attendant)\nLead in our guest. Unlock the furthest line\nOf guest-chambers; and bid the stewards there\nMake ready a full feast; then close with care\nThe midway doors. 'Tis unmeet, if he hears\nOur turmoil or is burdened with our tears.\n[The Attendant leads HERACLES into the house.]\nLEADER.\nHow, master? When within a thing so sad\nLies, thou wilt house a stranger? Art thou mad?\nADMETUS.\nAnd had I turned the stranger from my door,\nWho sought my shelter, hadst thou praised me more?\nI trow not, if my sorrow were thereby\nNo whit less, only the more friendless I.\nAnd more, when bards tell tales, were it not worse\nMy house should lie beneath the stranger's curse?\nNow he is my sure friend, if e'er I stand\nLonely in Argos, in a thirsty land.\nLEADER.\nThou callest him thy friend; how didst thou dare\nKeep hid from him the burden of thy care?\nADMETUS.\nHe never would have entered, had he known\nMy grief.—Aye, men may mock what I have done,\nAnd call me fool. My house hath never learned\nTo fail its friend, nor seen the stranger spurned.\n[ADMETUS goes into the house]\nCHORUS.\nOh, a House that loves the stranger,\nAnd a House for ever free!\nAnd Apollo, the Song-changer,\nWas a herdsman in thy fee;\nYea, a-piping he was found,\nWhere the upward valleys wound,\nTo the kine from out the manger\nAnd the sheep from off the lea,\nAnd love was upon Othrys at the sound.\nAnd from deep glens unbeholden\nOf the forest to his song\nThere came lynxes streaky-golden,\nThere came lions in a throng,\nTawny-coated, ruddy-eyed,\nTo that piper in his pride;\nAnd shy fawns he would embolden,\nDappled dancers, out along\nThe shadow by the pine-tree's side.\nAnd those magic pipes a-blowing\nHave fulfilled thee in thy reign\nBy thy Lake with honey flowing,\nBy thy sheepfolds and thy grain;\nWhere the Sun turns his steeds\nTo the twilight, all the meads\nOf Molossus know thy sowing\nAnd thy ploughs upon the plain.\nYea, and eastward thou art free\nTo the portals of the sea,\nAnd Pelion, the unharboured, is but minister to thee.\nHe hath opened wide his dwelling\nTo the stranger, though his ruth\nFor the dead was fresh and welling,\nFor the loved one of his youth.\n'Tis the brave heart's cry:\n'I will fail not, though I die!'\nDoth it win, with no man's telling,\nSome high vision of the truth?\nWe may marvel. Yet I trust,\nWhen man seeketh to be just\nAnd to pity them that wander, God will raise him from the dust.\n[As the song ceases the doors are thrown open and ADMETUS comes before them: a great funeral procession is seen moving out.]\nADMETUS.\nMost gentle citizens, our dead is here\nMade ready; and these youths to bear the bier\nUplifted to the grave-mound and the urn.\nNow, seeing she goes forth never to return,\nBid her your last farewell, as mourners may.\n[The procession moves forward, past him.]\nLEADER.\nNay, lord; thy father, walking old and grey;\nAnd followers bearing burial gifts and brave\nGauds, which men call the comfort of the grave.\nEnter PHERES with followers bearing robes and gifts.\nPHERES.\nI come in sorrow for thy sorrow, son.\nA faithful wife indeed thou hast lost, and one\nWho ruled her heart. But, howso hard they be,\nWe needs must bear these griefs.—Some gifts for thee\nAre here…. Yes; take them. Let them go beneath\nThe sod. We both must honour her in death,\nSeeing she hath died, my son, that thou mayst live\nNor I be childless. Aye, she would not give\nMy soul to a sad old age, mourning for thee.\nMethinks she hath made all women's life to be\nA nobler thing, by one great woman's deed.\nThou saviour of my son, thou staff in need\nTo our wrecked age, farewell! May some good life\nBe thine still in the grave.—Oh, 'tis a wife\nLike this man needs; else let him stay unwed!\n[The old man has not noticed ADMETUS'S gathering indignation.]\nADMETUS.\nI called not thee to burial of my dead,\nNor count thy presence here a welcome thing.\nMy wife shall wear no robe that thou canst bring,\nNor needs thy help in aught. There was a day\nWe craved thy love, when I was on my way\nDeathward—thy love, which bade thee stand aside\nAnd watch, grey-bearded, while a young man died!\nAnd now wilt mourn for her? Thy fatherhood!\nThou wast no true begetter of my blood,\nNor she my mother who dares call me child.\nOh, she was barren ever; she beguiled\nThy folly with some bastard of a thrall.\nHere is thy proof! This hour hath shown me all\nThou art; and now I am no more thy son.\n'Fore God, among all cowards can scarce be one\nLike thee. So grey, so near the boundary\nOf mortal life, thou wouldst not, durst not, die\nTo save thy son! Thou hast suffered her to do\nThine office, her, no kin to me nor you,\nYet more than kin! Henceforth she hath all the part\nOf mother, yea, and father in my heart.\nAnd what a glory had been thine that day,\nDying to save thy son—when, either way,\nThy time must needs be brief. Thy life has had\nAbundance of the things that make men glad;\nA crown that came to thee in youth; a son\nTo do thee worship and maintain thy throne—\nNot like a childless king, whose folk and lands\nLie helpless, to be torn by strangers' hands.\nWilt say I failed in duty to thine age;\nFor that thou hast let me die? Not so; most sage,\nMost pious I was, to mother and to thee;\nAnd thus ye have paid me! Well, I counsel ye.\nLose no more time. Get quick another son\nTo foster thy last years, to lay thee on\nThy bier, when dead, and wrap thee in thy pall.\nI will not bury thee. I am, for all\nThe care thou hast shown me, dead. If I have found\nAnother, true to save me at the bound\nOf life and death, that other's child am I,\nThat other's fostering friend, until I die.\nHow falsely do these old men pray for death,\nCursing their weight of years, their weary breath!\nWhen Death comes close, there is not one that dares\nTo die; age is forgot and all its cares.\nLEADER.\nOh, peace! Enough of sorrow in our path\nIs strewn. Thou son, stir not thy father's wrath.\nPHERES.\nMy son, whom seekest thou … some Lydian thrall,\nOr Phrygian, bought with cash?… to affright withal\nBy cursing? I am a Thessalian, free,\nMy father a born chief of Thessaly;\nAnd thou most insolent. Yet think not so\nTo fling thy loud lewd words at me and go.\nI got thee to succeed me in my hall,\nI have fed thee, clad thee. But I have no call\nTo die for thee. Not in our family,\nNot in all Greece, doth law bid fathers die\nTo save their sons. Thy road of life is thine\nNone other's, to rejoice at or repine.\nAll that was owed to thee by us is paid.\nMy throne is thine. My broad lands shall be made\nThine, as I had them from my father…. Say,\nHow have I wronged thee? What have I kept away?\n'Not died for thee?'… I ask not thee to die.\nThou lovest this light: shall I not love it, I?…\n'Tis age on age there, in the dark; and here\nMy sunlit time is short, but dear; but dear.\nThou hast fought hard enough. Thou drawest breath\nEven now, long past thy portioned hour of death,\nBy murdering her … and blamest my faint heart,\nCoward, who hast let a woman play thy part\nAnd die to save her pretty soldier! Aye,\nA good plan, surely! Thou needst never die;\nThou canst find alway somewhere some fond wife\nTo die for thee. But, prithee, make not strife\nWith other friends, who will not save thee so.\nBe silent, loving thine own life, and know\nAll men love theirs!… Taunt others, and thou too\nShalt hear much that is bitter, and is true.\nLEADER.\nToo much of wrath before, too much hath run\nAfter. Old man, cease to revile thy son.\nADMETUS.\nSpeak on. I have spoken…. If my truth of tongue\nGives pain to thee, why didst thou do me wrong?\nPHERES.\nWrong? To have died for thee were far more wrong.\nADMETUS.\nHow can an old life weigh against a young?\nPHERES.\nMan hath but one, not two lives, to his use.\nADMETUS.\nOh, live on; live, and grow more old than Zeus!\nPHERES.\nBecause none wrongs thee, thou must curse thy sire?\nADMETUS.\nI blest him. Is not life his one desire?\nPHERES.\nThis dead, methinks, is lying in thy place.\nADMETUS.\nA proof, old traitor, of thy cowardliness!\nPHERES.\nDied she through me?… That thou wilt hardly say.\nADMETUS (almost breaking down).\nO God!\nMayst thou but feel the need of me some day!\nPHERES.\nGo forward; woo more wives that more may die.\nADMETUS.\nAs thou wouldst not! Thine is the infamy.\nPHERES.\nThis light of heaven is sweet, and sweet again.\nADMETUS.\nThy heart is foul. A thing unmeet for men.\nPHERES.\nThou laugh'st not yet across the old man's tomb.\nADMETUS.\nDishonoured thou shalt die when death shall come.\nPHERES.\nOnce dead, I shall not care what tales are told.\nADMETUS.\nGreat Gods, so lost to honour and so old!\nPHERES.\nShe was not lost to honour: she was blind.\nADMETUS.\nGo! Leave me with my dead…. Out from my mind!\nPHERES.\nI go. Bury the woman thou hast slain….\nHer kinsmen yet may come to thee with plain\nQuestion. Acastus hath small place in good\nMen, if he care not for his sister's blood.\n[PHERES goes off, with his Attendants. ADMETUS calls after him as he goes.]\nADMETUS.\nBegone, begone, thou and thy bitter mate!\nBe old and childless—ye have earned your fate—\nWhile your son lives! For never shall ye be\nFrom henceforth under the same roof with me….\nMust I send heralds and a trumpet's call\nTo abjure thy blood? Fear not, I will send them all….\n[PHERES is now out of sight; ADMETUS drops his defiance and seems like a broken man.]\nBut we—our sorrow is upon us; come\nWith me, and let us bear her to the tomb.\nCHORUS.\nAh me!\nFarewell, unfalteringly brave!\nFarewell, thou generous heart and true!\nMay Pluto give thee welcome due,\nAnd Hermes love thee in the grave.\nWhate'er of blessèd life there be\nFor high souls to the darkness flown,\nBe thine for ever, and a throne\nBeside the crowned Persephonê.\n[The funeral procession has formed and moves slowly out, followed by ADMETUS and the CHORUS. The stage is left empty, till a side door of the Castle opens and there comes out a SERVANT, angry and almost in tears.]\nSERVANT.\nFull many a stranger and from many a land\nHath lodged in this old castle, and my hand\nServed them; but never has there passed this way\nA scurvier ruffian than our guest to-day.\nHe saw my master's grief, but all the more\nIn he must come, and shoulders through the door.\nAnd after, think you he would mannerly\nTake what was set before him? No, not he!\nIf, on this day of trouble, we left out\nSome small thing, he must have it with a shout.\nUp, in both hands, our vat of ivy-wood\nHe raised, and drank the dark grape's burning blood,\nStrong and untempered, till the fire was red\nWithin him; then put myrtle round his head\nAnd roared some noisy song. So had we there\nDiscordant music. He, without a care\nFor all the affliction of Admetus' halls,\nSang on; and, listening, one could hear the thralls\nIn the long gallery weeping for the dead.\nWe let him see no tears. Our master made\nThat order, that the stranger must not know.\nSo here I wait in her own house, and do\nService to some black thief, some man of prey;\nAnd she has gone, has gone for ever away.\nI never followed her, nor lifted high\nMy hand to bless her; never said good-bye….\nI loved her like my mother. So did all\nThe slaves. She never let his anger fall\nToo hard. She saved us alway…. And this wild beast\nComes in our sorrow when we need him least!\n[During the last few lines HERACLES has entered, unperceived by the SERVANT. He has evidently bathed and changed his garments and drunk his fill, and is now revelling, a garland of flowers on his head. He frightens the SERVANT a little from time to time during the following speech.]\nHERACLES.\nFriend, why so solemn and so cranky-eyed?\n'Tis not a henchman's office, to show pride\nTo his betters. He should smile and make good cheer.\nThere comes a guest, thy lord's old comrade, here;\nAnd thou art all knitted eyebrows, scowls and head\nBent, because somebody, forsooth, is dead!\nCome close! I mean to make thee wiser.\n[The SERVANT reluctantly comes close.]\nSo.\nDost comprehend things mortal, how they grow?…\n(To himself) I suppose not. How could he?…\nLook this way!\nDeath is a debt all mortal men must pay;\nAye, there is no man living who can say\nIf life will last him yet a single day.\nOn, to the dark, drives Fortune; and no force\nCan wrest her secret nor put back her course….\nI have told thee now. I have taught thee. After this\nEat, drink, make thyself merry. Count the bliss\nOf the one passing hour thine own; the rest\nIs Fortune's. And give honour chiefliest\nTo our lady Cypris, giver of all joys\nTo man. 'Tis a sweet goddess. Otherwise,\nLet all these questions sleep and just obey\nMy counsel…. Thou believest all I say?\nI hope so…. Let this stupid grieving be;\nRise up above thy troubles, and with me\nDrink in a cloud of blossoms. By my soul,\nI vow the sweet plash-music of the bowl\nWill break thy glumness, loose thee from the frown\nWithin. Let mortal man keep to his own\nMortality, and not expect too much.\nTo all your solemn dogs and other such\nScowlers—I tell thee truth, no more nor less—\nLife is not life, but just unhappiness.\n[He offers the wine-bowl to the SERVANT, who avoids it.]\nSERVANT.\nWe know all this. But now our fortunes be\nNot such as ask for mirth or revelry.\nHERACLES.\nA woman dead, of no one's kin; why grieve\nSo much? Thy master and thy mistress live.\nSERVANT.\nLive? Man, hast thou heard nothing of our woe?\nHERACLES.\nYes, thy lord told me all I need to know.\nSERVANT.\nHe is too kind to his guests, more kind than wise.\nHERACLES.\nMust I go starved because some stranger dies?\nSERVANT.\nSome stranger?—Yes, a stranger verily!\nHERACLES (his manner beginning to change).\nIs this some real grief he hath hid from me?\nSERVANT.\nGo, drink, man! Leave to us our master's woes.\nHERACLES.\nIt sounds not like a stranger. Yet, God knows…\nSERVANT.\nHow should thy revelling hurt, if that were all?\nHERACLES.\nHath mine own friend so wronged me in his hall?\nSERVANT.\nThou camest at an hour when none was free\nTo accept thee. We were mourning. Thou canst see\nOur hair, black robes…\nHERACLES (suddenly, in a voice of thunder).\nWho is it that is dead?\nSERVANT.\nAlcestis, the King's wife.\nHERACLES (overcome).\nWhat hast thou said?\nAlcestis?… And ye feasted me withal!\nSERVANT.\nHe held it shame to turn thee from his hall.\nHERACLES.\nShame! And when such a wondrous wife was gone!\nSERVANT (breaking into tears).\nOh, all is gone, all lost, not she alone!\nHERACLES.\nI knew, I felt it, when I saw his tears,\nAnd face, and shorn hair. But he won mine ears\nWith talk of the strange woman and her rite\nOf burial. So in mine own heart's despite\nI crossed his threshold and sat drinking—he\nAnd I old friends!—in his calamity.\nDrank, and sang songs, and revelled, my head hot\nWith wine and flowers!… And thou to tell me not,\nWhen all the house lay filled with sorrow, thou!\n(A pause; then suddenly)\nWhere lies the tomb?—Where shall I find her now?\nSERVANT (frightened).\nClose by the straight Larissa road. The tall\nWhite marble showeth from the castle wall.\nHERACLES.\nO heart, O hand, great doings have ye done\nOf old: up now, and show them what a son\nTook life that hour, when she of Tiryns' sod,\nElectryon's daughter, mingled with her God!\nI needs must save this woman from the shore\nOf death and set her in her house once more,\nRepaying Admetus' love…. This Death, this black\nAnd wingèd Lord of corpses, I will track\nHome. I shall surely find him by the grave\nA-hungered, lapping the hot blood they gave\nIn sacrifice. An ambush: then, one spring,\nOne grip! These arms shall be a brazen ring,\nWith no escape, no rest, howe'er he whine\nAnd curse his mauled ribs, till the Queen is mine!\nOr if he escape me, if he come not there\nTo seek the blood of offering, I will fare\nDown to the Houses without Light, and bring\nTo Her we name not and her nameless King\nStrong prayers, until they yield to me and send\nAlcestis home, to life and to my friend:\nWho gave me shelter, drove me not away\nIn his great grief, but hid his evil day\nLike a brave man, because he loved me well.\nIs one in all this land more hospitable,\nOne in all Greece? I swear no man shall say\nHe hath cast his love upon a churl away!\n[He goes forth, just as he is, in the direction of the grave. The SERVANT watches a moment and goes back into the hall.]\n[The stage is empty; then ADMETUS and the CHORUS return.]\nADMETUS.\nAlas!\nBitter the homeward way,\nBitter to seek\nA widowed house; ah me,\nWhere should I fly or stay,\nBe dumb or speak?\nWould I could cease to be!\nDespair, despair!\nMy mother bore me under an evil star.\nI envy them that are perished; my heart is there.\nIt dwells in the Sunless Houses, afar, afar.\nI take no joy in looking upon the light;\nNo joy in the feel of the earth beneath my tread.\nThe Slayer hath taken his hostage; the Lord of the Dead\nHoldeth me sworn to taste no more delight.\n[He throws himself on the ground in despair.]\nCHORUS. [Each member of the CHORUS speaks his line severally, as he passes ADMETUS, who is heard sobbing at the end of each line.]\n—Advance, advance;\nTill the house shall give thee cover.\n—Thou hast borne heavy things\nAnd meet for lamentation.\n—Thou hast passed, hast passed,\nThro' the deepest of the River.\n—Yet no help comes\nTo the sad and silent nation.\n—And the face of thy belovèd, it shall meet thee never, never!\nADMETUS.\nYe wrench my wounds asunder. Where\nIs grief like mine, whose wife is dead?\nMy wife, whom would I ne'er had wed,\nNor loved, nor held my house with her….\nBlessed are they who dare to dwell\nUnloved of woman! 'Tis but one\nHeart that they bleed with, and alone\nCan bear their one life's burden well.\nNo young shall wither at their side,\nNo bridal room be swept by death….\nAye, better man should draw his breath\nFor ever without child or bride.\nCHORUS (as before).\n—'Tis Fate, 'tis Fate:\nShe is strong and none shall break her.\n—No end, no end,\nWilt thou lay to lamentations?\n—Endure and be still:\nThy lamenting will not wake her.\n—There be many before thee,\nWho have suffered and had patience.\n—Though the face of Sorrow changeth, yet her hand is on all nations.\nADMETUS.\nThe garb of tears, the mourner's cry:\nThen the long ache when tears are past!…\nOh, why didst hinder me to cast\nThis body to the dust and die\nWith her, the faithful and the brave?\nThen not one lonely soul had fled,\nBut two great lovers, proudly dead,\nThrough the deep waters of the grave.\nLEADER.\nA friend I knew,\nIn whose house died a son,\nWorthy of bitter rue,\nHis only one.\nHis head sank, yet he bare\nStilly his weight of care,\nThough grey was in his hair\nAnd life nigh done.\nADMETUS.\nYe shapes that front me, wall and gate,\nHow shall I enter in and dwell\nAmong ye, with all Fortune's spell\nDischanted? Aye, the change is great.\nThat day I strode with bridal song\nThrough lifted brands of Pelian pine;\nA hand belovèd lay in mine;\nAnd loud behind a revelling throng\nExalted me and her, the dead.\nThey called us young, high-hearted; told\nHow princes were our sires of old,\nAnd how we loved and we must wed….\nFor those high songs, lo, men that moan,\nAnd raiment black where once was white;\nWho guide me homeward in the night,\nOn that waste bed to lie alone.\nSECOND ELDER.\nIt breaks, like strife,\nThy long peace, where no pain\nHad entered; yet is life,\nSweet life, not slain.\nA wife dead; a dear chair\nEmpty: is that so rare?\nMen live without despair\nWhose loves are ta'en.\nADMETUS (erect and facing them).\nBehold, I count my wife's fate happier,\nThough all gainsay me, than mine own. To her\nComes no more pain for ever; she hath rest\nAnd peace from all toil, and her name is blest.\nBut I am one who hath no right to stay\nAlive on earth; one that hath lost his way\nIn fate, and strays in dreams of life long past….\nFriends, I have learned my lesson at the last.\nI have my life. Here stands my house. But now\nHow dare I enter in? Or, entered, how\nGo forth again? Go forth, when none is there\nTo give me a parting word, and I to her?…\nWhere shall I turn for refuge? There within,\nThe desert that remains where she hath been\nWill drive me forth, the bed, the empty seat\nShe sat in; nay, the floor beneath my feet\nUnswept, the children crying at my knee\nFor mother; and the very thralls will be\nIn sobs for the dear mistress that is lost.\nThat is my home! If I go forth, a host\nOf feasts and bridal dances, gatherings gay\nOf women, will be there to fright me away\nTo loneliness. Mine eyes will never bear\nThe sight. They were her friends; they played with her.\nAnd always, always, men who hate my name\nWill murmur: 'This is he who lives in shame\nBecause he dared not die! He gave instead\nThe woman whom he loved, and so is fled\nFrom death. He counts himself a man withal!\nAnd seeing his parents died not at his call\nHe hates them, when himself he dared not die!'\nSuch mocking beside all my pain shall I\nEndure…. What profit was it to live on,\nFriend, with my grief kept and mine honour gone?\nCHORUS.\nI have sojourned in the Muse's land,\nHave wandered with the wandering star,\nSeeking for strength, and in my hand\nHeld all philosophies that are;\nYet nothing could I hear nor see\nStronger than That Which Needs Must Be.\nNo Orphic rune, no Thracian scroll,\nHath magic to avert the morrow;\nNo healing all those medicines brave\nApollo to the Asclepiad gave;\nPale herbs of comfort in the bowl\nOf man's wide sorrow.\nShe hath no temple, she alone,\nNor image where a man may kneel;\nNo blood upon her altar-stone\nCrying shall make her hear nor feel.\nI know thy greatness; come not great\nBeyond my dreams, O Power of Fate!\nAye, Zeus himself shall not unclose\nHis purpose save by thy decerning.\nThe chain of iron, the Scythian sword,\nIt yields and shivers at thy word;\nThy heart is as the rock, and knows\nNo ruth, nor turning.\n[They turn to ADMETUS.]\nHer hand hath caught thee; yea, the keeping\nOf iron fingers grips thee round.\nBe still. Be still. Thy noise of weeping\nShall raise no lost one from the ground.\nNay, even the Sons of God are parted\nAt last from joy, and pine in death….\nOh, dear on earth when all did love her,\nOh, dearer lost beyond recover:\nOf women all the bravest-hearted\nHath pressed thy lips and breathed thy breath.\nLet not the earth that lies upon her\nBe deemed a grave-mound of the dead.\nLet honour, as the Gods have honour,\nBe hers, till men shall bow the head,\nAnd strangers, climbing from the city\nHer slanting path, shall muse and say:\n'This woman died to save her lover,\nAnd liveth blest, the stars above her:\nHail, Holy One, and grant thy pity!'\nSo pass the wondering words away.\nLEADER.\nBut see, it is Alcmena's son once more,\nMy lord King, cometh striding to thy door.\n[Enter HERACLES; his dress is as in the last scene, but shows signs of a struggle. Behind come two Attendants, guiding between them a veiled Woman, who seems like one asleep or unconscious. The Woman remains in the background while HERACLES comes forward.]\nHERACLES.\nThou art my friend, Admetus; therefore bold\nAnd plain I tell my story, and withhold\nNo secret hurt.—Was I not worthy, friend,\nTo stand beside thee; yea, and to the end\nBe proven in sorrow if I was true to thee?\nAnd thou didst tell me not a word, while she\nLay dead within; but bid me feast, as though\nNaught but the draping of some stranger's woe\nWas on thee. So I garlanded my brow\nAnd poured the gods drink-offering, and but now\nFilled thy death-stricken house with wine and song.\nThou hast done me wrong, my brother; a great wrong\nThou hast done me. But I will not add more pain\nIn thine affliction.\nWhy I am here again,\nReturning, thou must hear. I pray thee, take\nAnd keep yon woman for me till I make\nMy homeward way from Thrace, when I have ta'en\nThose four steeds and their bloody master slain.\nAnd if—which heaven avert!—I ne'er should see\nHellas again, I leave her here, to be\nAn handmaid in thy house. No labour small\nWas it that brought her to my hand at all.\nI fell upon a contest certain Kings\nHad set for all mankind, sore buffetings\nAnd meet for strong men, where I staked my life\nAnd won this woman. For the easier strife\nBlack steeds were prizes; herds of kine were cast\nFor heavier issues, fists and wrestling; last,\nThis woman…. Lest my work should all seem done\nFor naught, I needs must keep what I have won;\nSo prithee take her in. No theft, but true\nToil, won her…. Some day thou mayst thank me, too.\nADMETUS.\n'Twas in no scorn, no bitterness to thee,\nI hid my wife's death and my misery.\nMethought it was but added pain on pain\nIf thou shouldst leave me, and roam forth again\nSeeking another's roof. And, for mine own\nSorrow, I was content to weep alone.\nBut, for this damsel, if it may be so,\nI pray thee, Lord, let some man, not in woe\nLike mine, take her. Thou hast in Thessaly\nAbundant friends…. 'Twould wake sad thoughts in me.\nHow could I have this damsel in my sight\nAnd keep mine eyes dry? Prince, why wilt thou smite\nThe smitten? Griefs enough are on my head.\nWhere in my castle could so young a maid\nBe lodged—her veil and raiment show her young:\nHere, in the men's hall? I should fear some wrong.\n'Tis not so easy, Prince, to keep controlled\nMy young men. And thy charge I fain would hold\nSacred.—If not, wouldst have me keep her in\nThe women's chambers … where my dead hath been?\nHow could I lay this woman where my bride\nOnce lay? It were dishonour double-dyed.\nThese streets would curse the man who so betrayed\nThe wife who saved him for some younger maid;\nThe dead herself … I needs must worship her\nAnd keep her will.\n[During the last few lines ADMETUS has been looking at the veiled Woman and, though he does not consciously recognize her, feels a strange emotion overmastering him. He draws back.]\nAye. I must walk with care….\nO woman, whosoe'er thou art, thou hast\nThe shape of my Alcestis; thou art cast\nIn mould like hers…. Oh, take her from mine eyes!\nIn God's name!\n[HERACLES signs to the Attendants to take ALCESTIS away again.\nShe stays veiled and unnoticing in the background.]\nI was fallen, and in this wise\nThou wilt make me deeper fall…. Meseems, meseems,\nThere in her face the loved one of my dreams\nLooked forth.—My heart is made a turbid thing,\nCraving I know not what, and my tears spring\nUnbidden.—Grief I knew 'twould be; but how\nFiery a grief I never knew till now.\nLEADER.\nThy fate I praise not. Yet, what gift soe'er\nGod giveth, man must steel himself and bear.\nHERACLES (drawing ADMETUS on).\nWould God, I had the power, 'mid all this might\nOf arm, to break the dungeons of the night,\nAnd free thy wife, and make thee glad again!\nADMETUS.\nWhere is such power? I know thy heart were fain;\nBut so 'tis writ. The dead shall never rise.\nHERACLES.\nChafe not the curb, then: suffer and be wise.\nADMETUS.\nEasier to give such counsel than to keep.\nHERACLES.\nWho will be happier, shouldst thou always weep?\nADMETUS.\nWhy, none. Yet some blind longing draws me on…\nHERACLES.\n'Tis natural. Thou didst love her that is gone.\nADMETUS.\n'Tis that hath wrecked, oh more than wrecked, my life.\nHERACLES.\n'Tis certain: thou hast lost a faithful wife.\nADMETUS.\nTill life itself is dead and wearies me.\nHERACLES.\nThy pain is yet young. Time will soften thee,\n[The veiled Woman begins dimly, as though in a dream, to hear the words spoken.]\nADMETUS.\nTime? Yes, if time be death.\nHERACLES.\nNay, wait; and some\nWoman, some new desire of love, will come.\nADMETUS (indignantly).\nPeace!\nHow canst thou? Shame upon thee!\nHERACLES.\nThou wilt stay\nUnwed for ever, lonely night and day?\nADMETUS.\nNo other bride in these void arms shall lie.\nHERACLES.\nWhat profit will thy dead wife gain thereby?\nADMETUS.\nHonour; which finds her wheresoe'er she lies.\nHERACLES.\nMost honourable in thee: but scarcely wise!\nADMETUS.\nGod curse me, if I betray her in her tomb!\nHERACLES.\nSo be it!…\nAnd this good damsel, thou wilt take her home?\nADMETUS.\nNo, in the name of Zeus, thy father! No!\nHERACLES.\nI swear, 'tis not well to reject her so.\nADMETUS.\n'Twould tear my heart to accept her.\nHERACLES.\nGrant me, friend,\nThis one boon! It may help thee in the end.\nADMETUS.\nWoe's me!\nWould God thou hadst never won those victories!\nHERACLES.\nThou sharest both the victory and the prize.\nADMETUS.\nThou art generous…. But now let her go.\nHERACLES.\nShe shall,\nIf go she must. Look first, and judge withal.\n[He takes the veil off ALCESTIS.]\nADMETUS (steadily refusing to look).\nShe must.—And thou, forgive me!\nHERACLES.\nFriend, there is\nA secret reason why I pray for this.\nADMETUS (surprised, then reluctantly yielding).\nI grant thy boon then—though it likes me ill.\nHERACLES.\n'Twill like thee later. Now … but do my will.\nADMETUS (beckoning to an Attendant).\nTake her; find her some lodging in my hall.\nHERACLES.\nI will not yield this maid to any thrall.\nADMETUS.\nTake her thyself and lead her in.\nHERACLES.\nI stand\nBeside her; take her; lead her to thy hand.\n[He brings the Woman close to ADMETUS, who looks determinedly away. She reaches out her arms.]\nADMETUS.\nI touch her not.—Let her go in!\nHERACLES.\nI am loth\nTo trust her save to thy pledged hand and oath.\n[He lays his hand on ADMETUS'S shoulder.]\nADMETUS (desperately).\nLord, this is violence … wrong …\nHERACLES.\nReach forth thine hand\nAnd touch this comer from a distant land.\nADMETUS (holding out his hand without looking).\nLike Perseus when he touched the Gorgon, there!\nHERACLES.\nThou hast touched her?\nADMETUS (at last taking her hand).\nTouched her?… Yes.\nHERACLES (a hand on the shoulder of each).\nThen cling to her;\nAnd say if thou hast found a guest of grace\nIn God's son, Heracles! Look in her face;\nLook; is she like…?\n[ADMETUS looks and stands amazed.]\nGo, and forget in bliss\nThy sorrow!\nADMETUS.\nO ye Gods! What meaneth this?\nA marvel beyond dreams! The face … 'tis she;\nMine, verily mine! Or doth God mock at me\nAnd blast my vision with some mad surmise?\nHERACLES.\nNot so. This is thy wife before thine eyes.\nADMETUS (who has recoiled in his amazement).\nBeware! The dead have phantoms that they send…\nHERACLES.\nNay; no ghost-raiser hast thou made thy friend.\nADMETUS.\nMy wife … she whom I buried?\nHERACLES.\nI deceive\nThee not; nor wonder thou canst scarce believe.\nADMETUS.\nAnd dare I touch her, greet her, as mine own\nWife living?\nHERACLES.\nGreet her. Thy desire is won.\nADMETUS (approaching with awe),\nBeloved eyes; beloved form; O thou\nGone beyond hope, I have thee, I hold thee now?\nHERACLES.\nThou hast her: may no god begrudge your joy.\nADMETUS (turning to HERACLES).\nO lordly conqueror, Child of Zeus on high,\nBe blessèd! And may He, thy sire above,\nSave thee, as thou alone hast saved my love!\n[He kneels to HERACLES, who raises him.]\nBut how … how didst thou win her to the light?\nHERACLES.\nI fought for life with Him I needs must fight.\nADMETUS.\nWith Death thou hast fought! But where?\nHERACLES.\nAmong his dead\nI lay, and sprang and gripped him as he fled.\nADMETUS (in an awed whisper, looking towards ALCESTIS).\nWhy standeth she so still? No sound, no word!\nHERACLES.\nShe hath dwelt with Death. Her voice may not be heard\nEre to the Lords of Them Below she pay\nDue cleansing, and awake on the third day.\n(To the Attendants) So; guide her home.\n[They lead ALCESTIS to the doorway.]\nAnd thou, King, for the rest\nOf time, be true; be righteous to thy guest,\nAs he would have thee be. But now farewell!\nMy task yet lies before me, and the spell\nThat binds me to my master; forth I fare.\nADMETUS.\nStay with us this one day!

    "content":"Andromache\nBy Euripides\nWritten 428-24 B.C.E\nTranslated by E. P. Coleridge\nDramatis Personae\nANDROMACHE\nMAID OF ANDROMACHE\nCHORUS OF PHTHIAN WOMEN\nHERMIONE, daughter of MENELAUS and wife of Neoptolemus\nMENELAUS, King of Sparta\nMOLOSSUS, son of ANDROMACHE and Neoptolemus\nPELEUS, father of Achilles\nNURSE OF HERMIONE\nORESTES, son of Agamemnon\nMESSENGER\nTHETIS, the goddess, wife of PELEUS\nScene\nBefore the temple of THETIS in Thessaly. ANDROMACHE, dressed as a suppliant, is clinging to the altar in front of the temple. The palace of Achilles is nearby.\nANDROMACHE\nO city of Thebes, glory of Asia, whence on a day I came to Priam's princely home with many a rich and costly thing in my dower, affianced unto Hector to be the mother of his children, I Andromache, envied name in days of yore, but now of all women that have been or yet shall be the most unfortunate; for I have lived to see my husband Hector slain by Achilles, and the babe Astyanax, whom I bore my lord, hurled from the towering battlements, when the Hellenes sacked our Trojan home; and I myself am come to Hellas as a slave, though I was esteemed a daughter of a race most free, given to Neoptolemus that island-prince, and set apart for him as his special prize from the spoils of Troy. And here I dwell upon the boundaries of Phthia and Pharsalia's town, where Thetis erst, the goddess of the sea, abode with Peleus apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore the folk of Thessaly call it the sacred place of Thetis, in honour of the goddess's marriage. Here dwells the son of Achilles and suffers Peleus still to rule Pharsalia, not wishing to assume the sceptre while the old man lives. Within these halls have borne a boy to the son of Achilles, my master. Now aforetime for all my misery I ever had a hope to lead me on, that, if my child were safe, I might find some help and protection from my woes; but since my lord in scorn of his bondmaid's charms hath wedded that Spartan Hermione, I am tormented by her most cruelly; for she saith that I by secret enchantment am making her barren and distasteful to her husband, and that I design to take her place in this house, ousting her the rightful mistress by force; whereas I at first submitted against my will and now have resigned my place; be almighty Zeus my witness that it was not of my own free will I became her rival!\nBut I cannot convince her, and she longs to kill me, and her father Menelaus is an accomplice in this. E'en now is he within, arrived from Sparta for this very purpose, while I in terror am come to take up position here in the shrine of Thetis adjoining the house, if haply it may save me from death; for Peleus and his descendants hold it in honour as symbol of his marriage with the Nereid. My only son am I secretly conveying to a neighbour's house in fear for his life. For his sire stands not by my side to lend his aid and cannot avail his child at all, being absent in the land of Delphi, where he is offering recompense to Loxias for the madness he committed, when on a day he went to Pytho and demanded of Phoebus satisfaction for his father's death, if haply his prayer might avert those past sins and win for him the god's goodwill hereafter.\nThe MAID OF ANDROMACHE enters.\nMAID\nMistress mine, be sure I do not hesitate to call thee by that name, seeing that I thought it thy right in thine own house also, when we dwelt in Troy-land; as I was ever thy friend and thy husband's while yet he was alive, so now have I come with strange tidings, in terror lest any of our masters learn hereof but still out of pity for thee; for Menelaus and his daughter are forming dire plots against thee, whereof thou must beware.\nANDROMACHE\nAh! kind companion of my bondage, for such thou art to her, who, erst thy queen, is now sunk in misery; what are they doing? What new schemes are they devising in their eagerness to take away my wretched life?\nMAID\nAlas! poor lady, they intend to slay thy son, whom thou hast privily conveyed from out the house.\nANDROMACHE\nAh me! Has she heard that my babe was put out of her reach? Who told her? Woe is me! how utterly undone!\nMAID\nI know not, but thus much of their schemes I heard myself; and Menelaus has left the house to fetch him.\nANDROMACHE\nThen am I lost; ah, my child! those vultures twain will take and slay thee; while he who is called thy father lingers still in Delphi.\nMAID\nTrue, for had he been here thou wouldst not have fared so hardly, am sure; but, as it is, thou art friendless.\nANDROMACHE\nHave no tidings come that Peleus may arrive?\nMAID\nHe is too old to help thee if he came.\nANDROMACHE\nAnd yet I sent for him more than once.\nMAID\nSurely thou dost not suppose that any of thy messengers heed thee?\nANDROMACHE\nWhy should they? Wilt thou then go for me?\nMAID\nHow shall I explain my long absence from the house?\nANDROMACHE\nThou art a woman; thou canst invent a hundred ways.\nMAID\nThere is a risk, for Hermione keeps no careless guard.\nANDROMACHE\nDost look to that? Thou art disowning thy friends in distress.\nMAID\nNot so; never taunt me with that. I will go, for of a truth a woman and a slave is not of much account, e'en if aught befall me.\nThe MAID withdraws.\nANDROMACHE\nGo then, while I will tell to heaven the lengthy tale of lamentation, mourning, and weeping, that has ever been my hard lot; for 'tis woman's way to delight in present misfortunes even to keeping them always on her tongue and lips. But I have many reasons, not merely one for tears,-my city's fall, my Hector's death, the hardness of the lot to which I am bound, since I fell on slavery's evil days undeservedly. 'Tis never right to call a son of man happy, till thou hast seen his end, to judge from the way he passes it how he will descend to that other world.\nShe begins to chant.\n'Twas no bride Paris took with him to the towers of Ilium, but curse to his bed when he brought Helen to her bower. For her sake, Troy, did eager warriors, sailing from Hellas in a thousand ships, capture and make thee a prey to fire and sword; and the son of sea-born Thetis mounted on his chariot dragged my husband Hector round the walls, ah woe is me! while I was hurried from my chamber to the beach, with slavery's hateful pall upon me. And many tear I shed as I left my city, my bridal bower, and my husband in the dust. Woe, woe is me! why should I prolong my life, to serve Hermione? Her cruelty it is that drives me hither to the image of the goddess to throw my suppliant arms about it, melting to tears as doth a spring that gushes from the rock.\nThe CHORUS OF PHTHIAN WOMEN enters.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nLady, thus keeping thy weary station without pause upon the floor of Thetis' shrine, Phthian though I am, to thee a daughter of Asia I come, to see if I can devise some remedy for these perplexing troubles, which have involved thee and Hermione in fell discord, because to thy sorrow thou sharest with her the love of Achilles' son.\nantistrophe 1\nRecognize thy position, weigh the present evil into the which thou art come. Thou art a Trojan captive; thy rival is thy mistress, a true-born daughter of Sparta. Leave then this home of sacrifice, the shrine of our sea-goddess. How can it avail thee to waste thy comeliness and disfigure it by weeping by reason of a mistress's harsh usage? Might will prevail against thee; why vainly toil in thy feebleness?\nstrophe 2\nCome, quit the bright sanctuary of the Nereid divine. Recognize that thou art in bondage on a foreign soil, in a strange city, where thou seest none of all thy friends, luckless lady, cast on evil days.\nantistrophe 2\nYea, I did pity thee most truly, Trojan dame, when thou camest to this house; but from fear of my mistress I hold my peace, albeit I sympathize with thee, lest she, whom Zeus's daughter bore, discover my good will toward thee.\nHERMIONE enters, in complete royal regalia.\nHERMIONE\nWith a crown of golden workmanship upon my head and about my body this embroidered robe am I come hither; no presents these I wear from the palace of Achilles or Peleus, but gifts my father Menelaus gave me together with a sumptuous dower from Sparta in Laconia, to insure me freedom of speech. Such is my answer to you;\nto the CHORUS\nbut as for thee, slave and captive, thou wouldst fain oust me and secure this palace for thyself, and thanks to thy enchantment I am hated by my husband; thou it is that hast made my womb barren and cheated my hopes; for Asia's daughters have clever heads for such villainy; yet will I check thee therefrom, nor shall this temple of the Nereid avail thee aught, no! neither its altar or shrine, but thou shalt die. But if or god or man should haply wish to save thee, thou must atone for thy proud thoughts of happier days now past by humbling thyself and crouching prostrate at my knees, by sweeping out my halls, and by learning, as thou sprinklest water from a golden ewer, where thou now art. Here is no Hector, no Priam with his gold, but a city of Hellas. Yet thou, miserable woman, hast gone so far in wantonness that thou canst lay thee down with the son of the very man that slew thy husband, and bear children to the murderer. Such is all the race of barbarians; father and daughter, mother and son, sister and brother mate together; the nearest and dearest stain their path with each other's blood, and no law restrains such horrors. Bring not these crimes amongst us, for here we count it shame that one man should have the control of two wives, and men are content to turn to one lawful love, that is, all who care to live an honourable life.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nWomen are by nature somewhat jealous, and do ever show the keenest hate to rivals in their love.\nANDROMACHE\nAh! well-a-day! Youth is a bane to mortals, in every case, that is, where a man embraces injustice in his early days. Now I am afraid that my being a slave will prevent thee listening to me in spite of many a just plea, or if I win my case, I fear I may be damaged on this very ground, for the high and mighty cannot brook refuting arguments from their inferiors; still I will not be convicted of betraying my own cause. Tell me, proud young wife, what assurance can make me confident of wresting from thee thy lawful lord? Is it that Laconia's capital yields to Phrygia? is it that my fortune outstrips thine? or that in me thou seest a free woman? Am I so elated by my youth, my full healthy figure, the extent of my city, the number of my friends that I wish to supplant thee in thy home? Is my purpose to take thy place and rear myself a race of slaves, mere appendages to my misery? or, supposing thou bear no children, will any one endure that sons of mine should rule o'er Phthia? Ah no! there is the love that Hellas bears me, both for Hector's sake and for my own humble rank forsooth, that never knew a queen's estate in Troy. 'Tis not my sorcery that makes thy husband hate thee, nay, but thy own failure to prove thyself his help-meet. Herein lies love's only charm; 'tis not beauty, lady, but virtuous acts that win our husbands' hearts. And though it gall thee to be told so, albeit thy city in Laconia is no doubt mighty fact, yet thou findest no place for his Scyros, displaying wealth 'midst poverty and setting Menelaus above Achilles: and that is what alienates thy lord. Take heed; for a woman, though bestowed upon worthless husband, must be with him content, and ne'er advance presumptuous claims. Suppose thou hadst wedded a prince of Thrace, the land of flood and melting snow, where one lord shares his affections with a host of wives, wouldst thou have slain them? If so, thou wouldst have set a stigma of insatiate lust on all our sex. A shameful charge! And yet herein we suffer more than men, though we make a good stand against it. Ah! my dear lord Hector, for thy sake would I e'en brook a rival, if ever Cypris led thee astray, and oft in days gone by I held thy bastard babes to my own breast, to spare thee any cause for grief. By this course I bound my husband to me by virtue's chains, whereas thou wilt never so much as let the drops of dew from heaven above settle on thy lord, in thy jealous fear. Oh! seek not to surpass thy mother in hankering after men, for 'tis well that all wise children should avoid the habits of such evil mothers.\nLEADER\nMistress mine, be persuaded to come to terms with her, as far as readily comes within thy power.\nHERMIONE\nWhy this haughty tone, this bandying of words, as if, forsooth, thou, not I, wert the virtuous wife?\nANDROMACHE\nThy present claims at any rate give thee small title thereto.\nHERMIONE\nWoman, may my bosom never harbour such ideas as thine!\nANDROMACHE\nThou art young to speak on such a theme as this.\nHERMIONE\nAs for thee, thou dost not speak thereof, but, as thou canst, dost put it into action against me.\nANDROMACHE\nCanst thou not conceal thy pangs of jealousy?\nHERMIONE\nWhat! doth not every woman put this first of all?\nANDROMACHE\nYes, if her experiences are happy; otherwise, there is no honour in speaking of them.\nHERMIONE\nBarbarians' laws are not a standard for our city.\nANDROMACHE\nAlike in Asia and in Hellas infamy attends base actions.\nHERMIONE\nClever, clever quibbler! yet die thou must and shalt.\nANDROMACHE\nDost see the image of Thetis with her eye upon thee?\nHERMIONE\nA bitter foe to thy country because of the death of Achilles.\nANDROMACHE\n'Twas not I that slew him, but Helen that mother of thine.\nHERMIONE\nPray, is it thy intention to probe my wounds yet deeper?\nANDROMACHE\nBehold, I am dumb, my lips are closed.\nHERMIONE\nTell me that which was my only reason for coming hither.\nANDROMACHE\nNo! all I tell thee is, thou hast less wisdom than thou needest.\nHERMIONE\nWilt thou leave these hallowed precincts of the sea-goddess?\nANDROMACHE\nYes, if I am not to die for it; otherwise, I never will.\nHERMIONE\nSince that is thy resolve, I shall not even wait my lord's return.\nANDROMACHE\nNor yet will I, at any rate ere that, surrender to thee.\nHERMIONE\nI will bring fire to bear on thee, and pay no heed to thy entreaties.\nANDROMACHE\nKindle thy blaze then; the gods will witness it.\nHERMIONE\nAnd make thy flesh to writhe by cruel wounds.\nANDROMACHE\nBegin thy butchery, stain the altar of the goddess with blood, for she will visit thy iniquity.\nHERMIONE\nBarbarian creature, hardened in impudence, wilt thou brave death itself? Still will I find speedy means to make these quit this seat of thy free will; such a bait have I to lure thee with. But I will hide my meaning, which the event itself shall soon declare. Yes, keep thy seat, for I will make thee rise, though molten lead is holding thee there, before Achilles' son, thy trusted champion, arrive.\nHERMIONE departs.\nANDROMACHE\nMy trusted champion, yes! how strange it is, that though some god hath devised cures for mortals against the venom of reptiles, no man ever yet hath discovered aught to cure a woman's venom, which is far worse than viper's sting or scorching flame; so terrible a curse are we to mankind.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nAh! what sorrows did the son of Zeus and Maia herald, in the day he came to Ida's glen, guiding that fair young trio of goddesses, all girded for the fray in bitter rivalry about their beauty, to the shepherd's fold where dwelt the youthful herdsman all alone by the hearth of his lonely hut.\nantistrophe 1\nSoon as they reached the wooded glen, in gushing mountain springs they bathed their dazzling skin, then sought the son of Priam, comparing their rival charms in more than rancorous phrase. But Cypris won the day by her deceitful promises, sweet-sounding words, but fraught with ruthless overthrow to Phrygia's hapless town and Ilium's towers.\nstrophe 2\nWould God his mother had smitten him a cruel death-blow on the head before he made his home on Ida's slopes, in the hour Cassandra, standing by the holy bay-tree, cried out, 'Slay him, for he will bring most grievous bane on Priam's town.' To every prince she went, to every elder sued for the babe's destruction.\nantistrophe 2\nAh! had they listened, Ilium's daughters neer had felt the yoke of slavery, and thou, lady, hadst been established in the royal palace; and Hellas had been freed of all the anguish she suffered during those ten long years her sons went wandering, spear in hand, around the walls of Troy; brides had never been left desolate, nor hoary fathers childless.\nMENELAUS and his retinue enter. He is leading MOLOSSUS by the hand.\nMENELAUS\nBehold I bring thy son with me, whom thou didst steal away to a neighbour's house without my daughter's knowledge. Thou wert so sure this image of the goddess would protect thee and those who hid him, but thou hast not proved clever enough for Menelaus. And so if thou refuse to leave thy station here, he shall be slain instead of thee. Wherefore weigh it well: wilt die thyself, or see him slain for the sin whereof thou art guilty against me and my daughter?\nANDROMACHE\nO fame, fame! full many a man ere now of no account hast thou to high estate exalted. Those, indeed, who truly have a fair repute, I count blest; but those who get it by false pretences, I will never allow have aught but the accidental appearance of wisdom. Thou for instance, caitiff that thou art, didst thou ever wrest Troy from Priam with thy picked troops of Hellenes? thou that hast raised such a storm, at the word of thy daughter, a mere child, and hast entered the lists with a poor captive; unworthy I count thee of Troy's capture, and Troy still more disgraced by thy victory. Those who only in appearance are men of sense make an outward show, but inwardly resemble the common herd, save it be in wealth, which is their chiefest strength.\nCome now, Menelaus, let us carry through this argument. Suppose I am slain by thy daughter, and she work her will on me, yet can she never escape the pollution of murder, and public opinion will make thee too an accomplice in this deed of blood, for thy share in the business must needs implicate thee. But even supposing I escape death myself, will ye kill my child? Even then, how will his father brook the murder of his child? Troy has no such coward's tale to tell of him; nay, he will follow duty's call; his actions will prove him a worthy scion of Peleus and Achilles. Thy daughter will be thrust forth from his house; and what wilt thou say when seeking to betroth her to another? wilt say her virtue made her leave a worthless lord? Nay, that will be false. Who then will wed her? wilt thou keep her without a husband in thy halls, grown grey in widowhood? Unhappy wretch! dost not see the flood-gates of trouble opening wide for thee? How many a wrong against a wife wouldst thou prefer thy daughter to have found to suffering what I now describe? We ought not on trifling grounds to promote great ills; nor should men, if we women are so deadly a curse, bring their nature down to our level. No! if, as thy daughter asserts, I am practising sorcery against her and making her barren, right willingly will I, without any crouching at altars, submit in my own person to the penalty that lies in her husband's hands, seeing that I am no less chargeable with injuring him if I make him childless. This is my case; but for thee, there is one thing I fear in thy disposition; it was a quarrel for a woman that really induced thee to destroy poor Ilium's town.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nThou hast said too much for a woman speaking to men; that discretion hath shot away its last shaft from thy soul's quiver.\nMENELAUS\nWomen, these are petty matters, unworthy, as thou sayest, of my despotic sway, unworthy too of Hellas. Yet mark this well; his special fancy of the hour is of more moment to a man than Troy's capture. I then have set myself to help my daughter because I consider her loss of wife's rights most grave; for whatever else a woman suffers is second to this; if she loses her husband's love she loses her life therewith. Now, as it is right Neoptolemus should rule my slaves, so my friends and I should have control of his; for friends, if they be really friends, keep nothing to themselves, but have all in common. So if I wait for the absent instead of making the best arrangement I can at once of my affairs, I show weakness, not wisdom. Arise then, leave the goddess's shrine, for by thy death this child escapeth his, whereas, if thou refuse to die, I will slay him; for one of you twain must perish.\nANDROMACHE\nAh me! 'tis a bitter lot thou art offering about my life; whether I take it or not I am equally unfortunate. Attend to me, thou who for a trifling cause art committing an awful crime. Why art thou bent on slaying me? What reason hast thou? What city have I betrayed? Which of thy children was ever slain by me? What house have I fired? I was forced to be my master's concubine; and spite of that wilt thou slay me, not him who is to blame, passing by the cause and hurrying to the inevitable result? Ah me! my sorrows! Woe for my hapless country! How cruel my fate! Why had I to be a mother too and take upon me a double load of suffering? Yet why do I mourn the past, and o'er the present never shed a tear or compute its griefs? I that saw Hector butchered and dragged behind the chariot, and Ilium, piteous sight! one sheet of flame, while I was baled away by the hair of my head to the Argive ships in slavery, and on my arrival in Phthia was given to Hector's murderer as his mistress. What pleasure then has life for me? Whither am I to turn my gaze? to the present or the past? My babe alone was left me, the light of my life, and him these ministers of death would slay. No! they shall not, if my poor life can save him; for if he be saved, hope in him lives on, while to me 'twere shame to refuse to die for my son. Lo! here I leave the altar and give myself into your hands, to cut or stab, to bind or hang. Ah! my child, to Hades now thy mother passes to save thy dear life. Yet if thou escape thy doom, remember me, my sufferings and my death, and tell thy father how I fared, with fond caress and streaming eye and arms thrown round his neck. Ah! yes, his children are to every man as his own soul; and whoso sneers at this through inexperience, though he suffers less anguish, yet tastes the bitter in his cup of bliss.\nLEADER\nThy tale with pity fills me; for every man alike, stranger though he be, feels pity for another's distress. Menelaus, 'tis thy duty to reconcile thy daughter and this captive, giving her a respite from sorrow.\nMENELAUS\nHo! sirrahs, seize this woman\nHis attendants swiftly carry out the order.\n; hold her fast; for 'tis no welcome story she will have to hear. It was to make thee leave the holy altar of the goddess that I held thy child's death before thy eyes, and so induced thee to give thyself up to me to die. So stands thy case, be well assured; but as for this child, my daughter shall decide whether she will slay him or no. Get thee hence into the house, and there learn to bridle thy insolence in speaking to the free, slave that thou art.\nANDROMACHE\nAlas! thou hast by treachery beguiled me; I was deceived.\nMENELAUS\nProclaim it to the world; I do not deny it.\nANDROMACHE\nIs this counted cleverness amongst you who dwell by the Eurotas?\nMENELAUS\nYes, and amongst Trojans too, that those who suffer should retaliate.\nANDROMACHE\nThinkest thou God's hand is shortened, and that thou wilt not be punished?\nMENELAUS\nWhene'er that comes, I am ready to bear it. But thy life will I have.\nANDROMACHE\nWilt likewise slay this tender chick, whom thou hast snatched from 'neath my wing?\nMENELAUS\nNot I, but I will give him to my daughter to slay if she will.\nANDROMACHE\nAh me! why not begin my mourning then for thee, my child?\nMENELAUS\nOf a truth 'tis no very sure hope that he has left.\nANDROMACHE\nO citizens of Sparta, the bane of all the race of men, schemers of guile, and masters in lying, devisers of evil plots, with crooked minds and tortuous methods and ne'er one honest thought, 'tis wrong that ye should thrive in Hellas. What crime is wanting in your list? How rife is murder with you! How covetous ye are! One word upon your lips, another in your heart, this is what men always find with you. Perdition catch ye! Still death is not so grievous, as thou thinkest, to me. No! for my life ended in the day that hapless Troy was destroyed with my lord, that glorious warrior, whose spear oft made a coward like thee quit the field and seek thy ship. But now against a woman hast thou displayed the terrors of thy panoply, my would-be murderer. Strike then! for this my tongue shall never flatter thee or that daughter of thine. For though thou wert of great account in Sparta, why so was I in Troy. And if I am now in sorry plight, presume not thou on this; thou too mayst be so yet.\nMENELAUS and his guards lead ANDROMACHE out.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nNever, oh! never will I commend rival wives or sons of different mothers, a cause of strife, of bitterness, and grief in every house. would have a husband content with one wife whose rights he shareth with no other.\nantistrophe 1\nNot even in states is dual monarchy better to bear than undivided rule; it only doubles burdens and causes faction amongst the citizens. Often too will the Muse sow strife 'twixt rivals in the art of minstrelsy.\nstrophe 2\nAgain, when strong winds are drifting mariners, the divided counsel of the wise does not best avail for steering, and their collective wisdom has less weight than the inferior mind of the single man who has sole authority; for this is the essence of power alike in house and state, whene'er men care to find the proper moment.\nantistrophe 2\nThis Spartan, the daughter of the great chief Menelaus, proves this; for she hath kindled hot fury against a rival, and is bent on slaying the hapless Trojan maid and her child to further her bitter quarrel. 'Tis a murder gods and laws and kindness all forbid. Ah! lady, retribution for this deed will yet visit thee.\nBut lo! before the house I see those two united souls, condemned to die. Alas! for thee, poor lady, and for thee, unhappy child, who art dying on account of thy mother's marriage, though thou hast no share therein and canst not be blamed by the royal house.\nANDROMACHE enters, her arms bound. Her son clings to her. MENELAUS and the guards follow, intent on accomplishing the murder. The following lines are chanted responsively.\nANDROMACHE\nBehold me journeying on the downward path, my hands so tightly bound with cords that they bleed.\nMOLOSSUS\nO mother, mother mine! I too share thy downward path, nestling 'neath thy wing.\nANDROMACHE\nA cruel sacrifice! ye rulers of Phthia!\nMOLOSSUS\nCome, father! succour those thou lovest.\nANDROMACHE\nRest there, my babe, my darling! on thy mother's bosom, e'en in death and in the grave.\nMOLOSSUS\nAh, woe is me! what will become of me and thee too, mother mine?\nMENELAUS\nAway, to the world below! from hostile towers ye came, the pair of you; two different causes necessitate your deaths; my sentence takes away thy life, and my daughter Hermione's requires his; for it would be the height of folly to leave our foemen's sons, when we might kill them and remove the danger from our house.\nANDROMACHE\nO husband mine! I would I had thy strong arm and spear to aid me, son of Priam.\nMOLOSSUS\nAh, woe is me! what spell can I now find to turn death's stroke aside?\nANDROMACHE\nEmbrace thy master's knees, my child, and pray to him.\nMOLOSSUS\nSpare, O spare my life, kind master!\nANDROMACHE\nMine eyes are wet with tears, which trickle down my cheeks, as doth a sunless spring from a smooth rock. Ah me!\nMOLOSSUS\nWhat remedy, alas! can I provide me 'gainst my ills?\nMENELAUS\nWhy fall at my knees in supplication? hard as the rock and deaf as the wave am I. My own friends have I helped, but for thee have no tie of affection; for verily it cost me a great part of my life to capture Troy and thy mother; so thou shalt reap the fruit thereof and into Hades' halls descend.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nBehold! I see Peleus drawing nigh; with aged step he hasteth hither.\nPELEUS enters with an attendant.\nPELEUS calling out as he comes in sight\nWhat means this? I ask you and your executioner; why is the palace in an uproar? give a reason; what mean your lawless machinations? Menelaus, hold thy hand. Seek not to outrun justice.\nTo his attendant\nForward! faster, faster! for this matter, methinks, admits of no delay; now if ever would I fain resume the vigour of my youth. First however will breathe new life into this captive, being to her as the breeze that blows a ship before the wind. Tell me, by what right have they pinioned thine arms and are dragging thee and thy child away? Like a ewe with her lamb art thou led to the slaughter, while I and thy lord were far away.\nANDROMACHE\nBehold them that are haling me and my child to death, e'en as thou seest, aged prince. Why should I tell thee? For not by one urgent summons alone but by countless messengers have I sent for thee. No doubt thou knowest by hearsay of the strife in this house with this man's daughter, and the reason of my ruin. So now they have torn and are dragging me from the altar of Thetis, the goddess of thy chiefest adoration and the mother of thy gallant son, without any proper trial, yea, and without waiting for my absent master; because, forsooth, they knew my defencelessness and my child's, whom they mean to slay with me his hapless mother, though he has done no harm. But to thee, O sire, I make my supplication, prostrate at thy knees, though my hand cannot touch thy friendly beard; save me, I adjure thee, reverend sir, or to thy shame and my sorrow shall we be slain.\nPELEUS\nLoose her bonds, I say, ere some one rue it; untie her folded hands.\nMENELAUS\nI forbid it, for besides being a match for thee, I have a far better right to her.\nPELEUS\nWhat! art thou come hither to set my house in order? Art not content with ruling thy Spartans?\nMENELAUS\nShe is my captive; I took her from Troy.\nPELEUS\nAye, but my son's son received her as his prize.\nMENELAUS\nIs not all I have his, and all his mine?\nPELEUS\nFor good, but not evil ends; and surely not for murderous violence.\nMENELAUS\nNever shalt thou wrest her from my grasp.\nPELEUS\nWith this good staff I'll stain thy head with blood!\nMENELAUS\nJust touch me and see! Approach one step!\nPELEUS\nWhat! shalt thou rank with men? chief of cowards, son of cowards! What right hast thou to any place 'mongst men? Thou who didst let Phrygian rob thee of thy wife, leaving thy home without bolt or guard, as if forsooth the cursed woman thou hadst there was a model of virtue. No! a Spartan maid could not be chaste, e'en if she would, who leaves her home and bares her limbs and lets her robe float free, to share with youths their races and their sports,-customs I cannot away with. Is it any wonder then that ye fail to educate your women in virtue? Helen might have asked thee this, seeing that she said goodbye to thy affection and tripped off with her young gallant to a foreign land. And yet for her sake thou didst marshal all the hosts of Hellas and lead them to Ilium, whereas thou shouldst have shown thy loathing for her by refusing to stir a spear, once thou hadst found her false; yea, thou shouldst have let her stay there, and even paid a price to save ever having her back again. But that was not at all the way thy thoughts were turned; wherefore many a brave life hast thou ended, and many an aged mother hast thou left childless in her home, and grey-haired sires of gallant sons hast reft. Of that sad band am I member, seeing in thee Achilles' murderer like a malignant fiend; for thou and thou alone hast returned from Troy without a scratch, bringing back thy splendid weapons in their splendid cases just as they went. As for me, I ever told that amorous boy to form no alliance with thee nor take unto his home an evil mother's child; for daughters bear the marks of their mothers' ill-repute into their new homes. Wherefore, ye wooers, take heed to this my warning: 'Choose the daughter of a good mother.' And more than this, with what wanton insult didst thou treat thy brother, bidding him sacrifice his daughter in his simpleness! So fearful wast thou of losing thy worthless wife. Then after capturing Troy,-for thither too will I accompany thee,-thou didst not slay that woman, when she was in thy power; but as soon as thine eyes caught sight of her breast, thy sword was dropped and thou didst take her kisses, fondling the shameless traitress, too weak to stem thy hot desire, thou caitiff wretch! Yet spite of all thou art the man to come and work havoc in my grandson's halls when he is absent, seeking to slay with all indignity a poor weak woman and her babe: but that babe shall one day make thee and thy daughter in thy home rue it, e'en though his birth be trebly base. Yea, for oft ere now hath seed, sown on barren soil, prevailed o'er rich deep tilth, and many bastard has proved a better man than children better born. Take thy daughter hence with thee! Far better is it for mortals to have a poor honest man either as married kin or friend than a wealthy knave; but as for thee, thou art a thing of naught.\nLEADER\nThe tongue from trifling causes contrives to breed great strife 'mongst men; wherefore are the wise most careful not to bring about a quarrel with their friends.\nMENELAUS\nWhy, pray, should one call these old men wise, or those who once had a reputation in Hellas for being so? when thou, the great Peleus, son of famous father, kin to me through marriage, employest language disgraceful to thyself and abusive of me because of a barbarian woman, though thou shouldst have banished her far beyond the streams of Nile or Phasis, and ever encouraged me; seeing that she comes from Asia's continent where fell so many of the sons of Hellas, victims to the spear; and likewise because she shared in the spilling of thy son's blood; for Paris who slew thy son Achilles, was brother to Hector, whose wife she was. And dost thou enter the same abode with her, and deign to let her share thy board, and suffer her to rear her brood of vipers in thy house? But I, after all this foresight for thee, old man, and myself, am to have her torn from my clutches for wishing to slay her. Yet come now, for 'tis no disgrace to argue; suppose my daughter has no child, while this woman's sons grow up, wilt thou set them up to rule the land of Phthia, barbarians born and bred to lord it over Hellenes? Am I then so void of sense because I hate injustice, and thou so full of cleverness? Consider yet another point; say thou hadst given a daughter of thine to some citizen, and hadst then seen her thus treated, wouldst thou have sat looking on in silence? I trow not. Dost thou then for a foreigner rail thus at thy nearest friends? Again, thou mayst say, husband and wife have an equally strong case if she is wronged by him, and similarly if he find her guilty of indiscretion in his house; yet while he has ample powers in his own hands, she depends on parents and friends for her case. Surely then I am right in helping my own kin! Thou art in thy dotage; for thou wilt do me more good by speaking of my generalship than by concealing it. Helen's trouble was not of her own choosing, but sent by heaven, and it proved a great benefit to Hellas; her sons, till then untried in war or arms, turned to deeds of prowess, and it is experience which teaches man all he knows. I showed my wisdom in refraining from slaying my wife, directly I caught sight of her. Would that thou too hadst ne'er slain Phocus! All this I bring before thee in pure good-will, not from anger. But if thou resent it, thy tongue may wag till it ache, yet shall I gain by prudent forethought.\nLEADER\nCease now from idle words, 'twere better far, for fear ye both alike go wrong.\nPELEUS\nAlas! what evil customs now prevail in Hellas! Whene'er the host sets up a trophy o'er the foe, men no more consider this the work of those who really toiled, but the general gets the credit for it. Now he was but one among ten thousand others to brandish his spear; he only did the work of one; but yet he wins more praise than they. Again, as magistrates in all the grandeur of office they scorn the common folk, though they are naught themselves; whereas those others are ten thousand times more wise than they, if daring combine with judgment. Even so thou and thy brother, exalted by the toilsome efforts of others, now take your seats in all the swollen pride of Trojan fame and Trojan generalship. But I will teach thee henceforth to consider Idaean Paris a foe less terrible than Peleus, unless forthwith thou pack from this roof, thou and thy childless daughter too, whom my own true son will hale through his halls by the hair of her head; for her barrenness will not let her endure fruitfulness in others, because she has no children herself. Still if misfortune prevents her bearing offspring, is that a reason why we should be left childless? Begone! ye varlets, let her go! I will soon see if anyone will hinder me from loosing her hands.\nto ANDROMACHE\nArise; these trembling hands of mine will untie the twisted thongs that bind thee. Out on thee, coward! is this how thou hast galled her wrists? Didst think thou wert lashing up a lion or bull? or wert afraid she would snatch a sword and defend herself against thee? Come, child, nestle to thy mother's arms; help me loose her bonds; I will yet rear thee in Phthia to be their bitter foe. If your reputation for prowess and the battles ye have fought were taken from you Spartans, in all else, be very sure, you have not your inferiors.\nLEADER\nThe race of old men practises no restraint; and their testiness makes it hard to check them.\nMENELAUS\nThou art only too ready to rush into abuse; while, as for me, I came to Phthia by constraint and have therefore no intention either of doing or suffering anything mean. Now must I return home, for I have no time to waste; for there is a city not so very far from Sparta, which aforetime was friendly but now is hostile; against her will I march with my army and bring her into subjection. And when I have arranged that matter as I wish, I will return; and face to face with my son-in-law I will give my version of the story and hear his. And if he punish her, and for the future she exercise self-control, she shall find me do the like; but if he storm, I'll storm as well; and every act of mine shall be a reflex of his own. As for thy babbling, I can bear it easily; for, like to a shadow as thou art, thy voice is all thou hast, and thou art powerless to do aught but talk.\nMENELAUS and his retinue withdraw.\nPELEUS\nLead on, my child, safe beneath my sheltering wing, and thou too, poor lady; for thou art come into a quiet haven after the rude storm.\nANDROMACHE\nHeaven reward thee and all thy race, old sire, for having saved my child and me his hapless mother! Only beware lest they fall upon us twain in some lonely spot upon the road and force me from thee, when they see thy age, my weakness, and this child's tender years; take heed to this, that we be not a second time made captive, after escaping now.\nPELEUS\nForbear such words, prompted by a woman's cowardice. Go on thy way; who will lay a finger on you? Methinks he will do it to his cost, For by heaven's grace I rule o'er many a knight and spearman bold in my kingdom of Phthia; yea, and myself can still stand straight, no bent old man as thou dost think; such a fellow as that a mere look from me will put to flight in spite of my years. For e'en an old man, be he brave, is worth a host of raw youths; for what avails a fine figure if a man is coward?\nPELEUS, ANDROMACHE, and MOLOSSUS go out.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe\nOh! to have never been born, or sprung from noble sires, the heir to mansions richly stored; for if aught untoward e'er befall, there is no lack of champions for sons of noble parents, and there is honour and glory for them when they are proclaimed scions of illustrious lines; time detracts not from the legacy these good men leave, but the light of their goodness still burns on when they are dead.\nantistrophe\nBetter is it not to win a discreditable victory, than to make justice miscarry by an invidious exercise of power; for such a victory, though men think it sweet for the moment, grows barren in time and comes near being a stain on a house. This is the life I commend, this the life I set before me as my ideal, to exercise no authority beyond what is right either in the marriage-chamber or in the state.\nepode\nO aged son of Aeacus! now am I sure that thou wert with the Lapithae, wielding thy famous spear, when they fought the Centaurs; and on Argo's deck didst pass the cheerless strait beyond the sea-beat Symplegades on her voyage famed; and when in days long gone the son of Zeus spread slaughter round Troy's famous town, thou too didst share his triumphant return to Europe.\nThe NURSE OF HERMIONE enters.\nNURSE\nAlas! good friends, what a succession of troubles is to-day provided us! My mistress Hermione within the house, deserted by her father and in remorse for her monstrous deed in plotting the death of Andromache and her child, is bent on dying; for she is afraid her husband will in requital for this expel her with dishonour from his house or put her to death, because she tried to slay the innocent. And the servants that watch her can scarce restrain her efforts to hang herself, scarce catch the sword and wrest it from her hand. So bitter is her anguish, and she hath recognized the villainy of her former deeds. As for me, friends, I am weary of keeping my mistress from the fatal noose; do ye go in and try to save her life; for if strangers come, they prove more persuasive than the friends of every day.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nAh yes! I hear an outcry in the house amongst the servants, confirming the news thou hast brought. Poor sufferer! she seems about to show lively grief for her grave crimes; for she has escaped her servants' hands and is rushing from the house, eager to end her life.\nHERMIONE enters, in agitation. She is carrying a sword which the NURSE wrests from her.\nHERMIONE chanting\nWoe, woe is me! I will rend my hair and tear cruel furrows in my cheeks.\nNURSE\nMy child, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou disfigure thyself?\nHERMIONE chanting\nAh me! ah me! Begone, thou fine-spun veil! float from my head away!\nNURSE\nDaughter, cover up thy bosom, fasten thy robe.\nHERMIONE chanting\nWhy should I cover it? My crimes against my lord are manifest and clear, they cannot be hidden.\nNURSE\nArt so grieved at having devised thy rival's death?\nHERMIONE chanting\nYea, I deeply mourn my fatal deeds of daring; alas! I am now accursed in all men's eyes!\nNURSE\nThy husband will pardon thee this error.\nHERMIONE chanting\nOh! why didst thou hunt me to snatch away my sword? Give, oh! give it back, dear nurse, that I may thrust it through my heart Why dost thou prevent me hanging myself?\nNURSE\nWhat! was I to let thy madness lead thee on to death?\nHERMIONE chanting\nAh me, my destiny! Where can I find some friendly fire? To what rocky height can I climb above the sea or 'mid some wooded mountain glen, there to die and trouble but the dead?\nNURSE\nWhy vex thyself thus? on all of us sooner or later heaven's visitation comes.\nHERMIONE chanting\nThou hast left me, O my father, left me like a stranded bark, all alone, without an oar. My lord will surely slay me; no home is mine henceforth beneath my husband's roof. What god is there to whose statue I can as a suppliant haste? or shall I throw myself in slavish wise at slavish knees? Would I could speed away from Phthia's land on bird's dark pinion, or like that pine-built ship, the first that ever sailed betwixt the rocks Cyanean!\nNURSE\nMy child, I can as little praise thy previous sinful excesses, committed against the Trojan captive, as thy present exaggerated terror. Thy husband will never listen to a barbarian's weak pleading and reject his marriage with thee for this. For thou wast no captive from Troy whom he wedded, but the daughter of a gallant sire, with a rich dower, from a city too of no mean prosperity. Nor will thy father forsake thee, as thou dreadest, and allow thee to be cast out from this house. Nay, enter now, nor show thyself before the palace, lest the sight of thee there bring reproach upon thee, my daughter.\nThe NURSE departs as ORESTES and his attendants enter.\nLEADER\nLo! a stranger of foreign appearance from some other land comes hurrying towards us.\nORESTES\nWomen of this foreign land! is this the home, the palace of Achilles' son?\nLEADER\nThou hast it; but who art thou to ask such a question?\nORESTES\nThe son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, by name Orestes, on ply way to the oracle of Zeus at Dodona. But now that I am come to Phthia, I am resolved to inquire about my kinswoman, Hermione of Sparta; is she alive and well? for though she dwells in a land far from my own, I love her none the less.\nHERMIONE\nSon of Agamemnon, thy appearing is as a haven from the storm to sailors; by thy knees I pray, have pity on me in my distress, on me of whose fortunes thou art inquiring. About thy knees I twine my arms with all the force of sacred fillets.\nORESTES\nHa! what is this? Am I mistaken or do I really see before me the queen of this palace, the daughter of Menelaus?\nHERMIONE\nThe same, that only child whom Helen, daughter of Tyndareus, bore my father in his halls; never doubt that.\nORESTES\nO saviour Phoebus, grant us respite from our woe! But what is the matter? art thou afflicted by gods or men?\nHERMIONE\nPartly by myself, partly by the man who wedded me, and partly by some god. On every side I see ruin.\nORESTES\nWhy, what misfortune could happen to a woman as yet childless, unless her honour is concerned?\nHERMIONE\nMy very ill! Thou hast hit my case exactly.\nORESTES\nOn whom has thy husband set his affections in thy stead?\nHERMIONE\nOn his captive, Hector's wife.\nORESTES\nAn evil case indeed, for a man to have two wives!\nHERMIONE\n'Tis even thus. So I resented it.\nORESTES\nDidst thou with woman's craft devise a plot against thy rival?\nHERMIONE\nYes, to slay her and her bastard child.\nORESTES\nAnd didst thou slay them, or did something happen to rescue them from thee?\nHERMIONE\nIt was old Peleus, who showed regard to the weaker side.\nORESTES\nHadst thou any accomplice in this attempted murder?\nHERMIONE\nMy father came from Sparta for this very purpose.\nORESTES\nAnd was he after all defeated by that old man's prowess?\nHERMIONE\nOh no! but by shame; and he hath gone and left me all alone.\nORESTES\nI understand; thou art afraid of thy husband for what thou hast done.\nHERMIONE\nThou hast guessed it; for he will have a right to slay me. What can say for myself? Yet I beseech thee by Zeus the god of our family, send me to a land as far as possible from this, or to my father's house; for these very walls seem to cry out 'Begone!' and all the land of Phthia hates me. But if my lord return ere that from the oracle of Phoebus, he will put me to death on a shameful charge, or enslave me to his mistress, whom ruled before. Maybe some one will say, 'How was it thou didst go thus astray?' I was ruined by evil women who came to me and puffed me up with words like these: 'Wait! wilt thou suffer that vile captive, a mere bondmaid, to dwell within thy house and share thy wedded rights? By Heaven's queen! if it were my house she should not live to reap my marriage-harvest!' And I listened to the words of these Sirens, the cunning, knavish, subtle praters, and was filled with silly thoughts. What need had I to care about my lord? I had all I wanted, wealth in plenty, a house in which I was mistress, and as for children, mine would be born in wedlock, while hers would be bastards, half-slaves to mine. Oh! never, never,-this truth will I repeat,-should men of sense, who have wives, allow women-folk to visit them in their homes, for they teach them evil; one, to gain some private end, helps to corrupt their honour; another, having made a slip herself, wants a companion in misfortune, while many are wantons; and hence it is men's houses are tainted. Wherefore keep strict guard upon the portals of your houses with bolts and bars; for these visits of strange women lead to no good result, but a world of ill.\nLEADER\nThou hast given thy tongue too free a rein regarding thy own sex. I can pardon thee in this case, but still women ought to smooth over their sisters' weaknesses.\nORESTES\n'Twas sage counsel he gave who taught men to hear the arguments on both sides. I, for instance, though aware of the confusion in this house, the quarrel between thee and Hector's wife, waited awhile and watched to see whether thou wouldst stay here or from fear of that captive art minded to quit these halls. Now it was not so much regard for thy message that brought me thither, as the intention of carrying thee away from this house, if, as now, thou shouldst grant me a chance of saying so. For thou wert mine formerly, but art now living with thy present husband through thy father's baseness; since he, before invading Troy's domains, betrothed thee to me, and then afterwards promised thee to thy present lord, provided he captured the city of Troy.\nSo, as soon as Achilles' son returned hither, I forgave thy father, but entreated the bridegroom to forego his marriage with thee, telling him all I had endured and my present misfortune; I might get a wife, I said, from amongst friends, but outside their circle 'twas no easy task for one exiled like myself from home. Thereat he grew abusive, taunting me with my mother's murder and those blood-boltered fiends. And I was humbled by the fortunes of my house, and though 'tis true, I grieved, yet did I bear my sorrow, and reluctantly departed, robbed of thy promised hand. Now therefore, since thou findest thy fortune so abruptly changed and art fallen thus on evil days and hast no help, I will take thee hence and place thee in thy father's hands. For kinship hath strong claims, and in adversity there is naught better than a kinsman's kindly aid.\nHERMIONE\nAs for my marriage, my father must look to it; 'tis not for me to decide. Yes, take me hence as soon as may be, lest my husband come back to his house before I am gone, or Peleus hear that I am deserting his son's abode and pursue me with his swift steeds.\nORESTES\nRest easy about the old man's power; and, as for Achilles' son with all his insolence to me, never fear him; such a crafty net this hand hath woven and set for his death with knots that none can loose; whereof I will not speak before the time, but, when my plot begins to work, Delphi's rock will witness it. If but my allies in the Pythian land abide by their oaths, this same murderer of his mother will show that no one else shall marry thee my rightful bride. To his cost will he demand satisfaction of King Phoebus for his father's blood; nor shall his repentance avail him though he is now submitting to the god. No! he shall perish miserably by Apollo's hand and my false accusations; so shall he find out my enmity. For the deity upsets the fortune of them that hate him, and suffers them not to be high-minded.\nORESTES and HERMIONE depart.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nO Phoebus! who didst fence the hill of Ilium with a fair coronal of towers, and thou, ocean-god! coursing o'er the main with thy dark steeds, wherefore did ye hand over in dishonour your own handiwork to the war-god, master of the spear, abandoning Troy to wretchedness?\nantistrophe 1\nMany a well-horsed car ye yoked on the banks of Simois, and many a bloody tournament did ye ordain with never a prize to win; and Ilium's princes are dead and gone; no longer in Troy is seen the blaze of fire on altars of the gods with the smoke of incense.\nstrophe 2\nThe son of Atreus is no more, slain by the hand of his wife, and she herself hath paid the debt of blood by death, and from her children's hands received her doom. The god's own bidding from his oracle was levelled against her, in the day that Agamemnon's son set forth from Argos and visited his shrine; so he slew her, aye, spilt his own mother's blood. O Phoebus, O thou power divine, how can I believe the story?\nantistrophe 2\nAnon wherever Hellenes gather, was heard the voice of lamentation, mothers weeping o'er their children's fate, as they left their homes to mate with strangers. Ah! thou art not the only one, nor thy dear ones either, on whom the cloud of grief hath fallen. Hellas had to bear the visitation, and thence the scourge crossed to Phrygia's fruitful fields, raining the bloody drops the death-god loves.\nPELEUS enters in haste.\nPELEUS\nYe dames of Phthia, answer my questions. I heard a vague rumour that the daughter of Menelaus had left these halls and fled; so now I am come in hot haste to learn if this be true; for it is the duty of those who are at home to labour in the interests of their absent friends.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nThou hast heard aright, O Peleus; ill would it become me to hide the evil case in which I now find myself; our queen has fled and left these halls.\nPELEUS\nWhat did she fear? explain that to me.\nLEADER\nShe was afraid her lord would cast her out.\nPELEUS\nIn return for plotting his child's death? surely not?\nLEADER\nYea, and she was afraid of yon captive.\nPELEUS\nWith whom did she leave the house? with her father?\nLEADER\nThe son of Agamemnon came and took her hence.\nPELEUS\nWhat view hath he to further thereby? Will he marry her?\nLEADER\nYes, and he is plotting thy grandson's death.\nPELEUS\nFrom an ambuscade, or meeting him fairly face to face?\nLEADER\nIn the holy place of Loxias, leagued with Delphians.\nPELEUS\nGod help us. This is a present danger. Hasten one of you with all speed to the Pythian altar and tell our friends there what has happened here, ere Achilles' son be slain by his enemies.\nA MESSENGER enters.\nMESSENGER\nWoe worth the day! what evil tidings have I brought for thee, old sire, and for all who love my master! woe is me!\nPELEUS\nAlas! my prophetic soul hath a presentiment.\nMESSENGER\nAged Peleus, hearken! Thy grandson is no more; so grievously is he smitten by the men of Delphi and the stranger from Mycenae.\nLEADER\nAh! what wilt thou do, old man? Fall not; uplift thyself.\nPELEUS\nI am a thing of naught; death is come upon me. My voice is choked, my limbs droop beneath me.\nMESSENGER\nHearken; if thou art eager also to avenge thy friends, lift up thyself and hear what happened.\nPELEUS\nAh, destiny! how tightly hast thou caught me in thy toils, a poor old man at life's extremest verge! But tell me how he was taken from me, my one son's only child; unwelcome as such news is, I fain would hear it.\nMESSENGER\nAs soon as we reached the famous soil of Phoebus, for three whole days were we feasting our eyes with the sight. And this, it seems, caused suspicion; for the folk, who dwell near the god's shrine, began to collect in groups, while Agamemnon's son, going to and fro through the town, would whisper in each man's ear malignant hints: 'Do ye see yon fellow, going in and out of the god's treasure-chambers, which are full of the gold stored there by all mankind? He is come hither a second time on the same mission as before, eager to sack the temple of Phoebus.' Thereon there ran an angry murmur through the city, and the magistrates flocked to their council-chamber, while those, who have charge of the god's treasures, had a guard privately placed amongst the colonnades. But we, knowing naught as yet of this, took sheep fed in the pastures of Parnassus, and went our way and stationed ourselves at the altars with vouchers and Pythian seers. And one said: 'What prayer, young warrior, wouldst thou have us offer to the god? Wherefore art thou come?' And he answered: 'I wish to make atonement to Phoebus for my past transgression; for once I claimed from him satisfaction for my father's blood.' Thereupon the rumour, spread by Orestes, proved to have great weight, suggesting that my master was lying and had come on a shameful errand. But he crosses the threshold of the temple to pray to Phoebus before his oracle, and was busy with his burnt-offering; when a body of men armed with swords set themselves in ambush against him in the cover of the bay-trees, and Clytemnestra's son, that had contrived the whole plot was one of them. There stood the young man praying to the god in sight of all, when lo! with their sharp swords they stabbed Achilles' unprotected son from behind. But he stepped back, for it was not a mortal wound he had received, and drew his sword, and snatching armour from the pegs where it hung on a pillar, took his stand upon the altar-steps, the picture of a warrior grim; then cried he to the sons of Delphi, and asked them: 'Why seek to slay me when I am come on a holy mission? What cause is there why I should die? But of all that throng of bystanders, no man answered him a word, but they set to hurling stones. Then he, though bruised and battered by the showers of missiles from all sides, covered himself behind his mail and tried to ward off the attack, holding his shield first here, then there, at arm's length, but all of no avail; for a storm of darts, arrows and javelins, hurtling spits with double points, and butchers' knives for slaying steers, came flying at his feet; and terrible was the war-dance thou hadst then seen thy grandson dance to avoid their marksmanship. At last, when they were hemming him in on all sides, allowing him no breathing space, he left the shelter of the altar, the hearth where victims are placed, and with one bound was on them as on the Trojans of yore; and they turned and fled like doves when they see the hawk. Many fell in the confusion: some wounded, and others trodden down by one another along the narrow passages; and in that hushed holy house uprose unholy din and echoed back from the rocks. Calm and still my master stood there in his gleaming harness like a flash of light, till from the inmost shrine there came a voice of thrilling horror, stirring the crowd to make a stand. Then fell Achilles' son, smitten through the flank by some Delphian's biting blade, some fellow that slew him with a host to help; and as he fell, there was not one that did not stab him, or cast a rock and batter his corpse. So his whole body, once so fair, was marred with savage wounds. At last they cast the lifeless clay, Iying near the altar, forth from the fragrant fane. And we gathered up his remains forthwith and are bringing them to thee, old prince, to mourn and weep and honour with a deep-dug tomb.\nThis is how that prince who vouchsafeth oracles to others, that judge of what is right for all the world, hath revenged himself on Achilles' son, remembering his ancient quarrel as a wicked man would. How then can he be wise?\nThe MESSENGER withdraws as the body of Neoptolemus is carried in on a bier. The following lines between PELEUS and the CHORUS are chanted responsively.\nCHORUS\nLo! e'en now our prince is being carried on a bier from Delphi's land unto his home. Woe for him and his sad fate, and woe for thee, old sire! for this is not the welcome thou wouldst give Achilles' son, the lion's whelp; thyself too by this sad mischance dost share his evil lot.\nPELEUS\nAh! woe is me! here is a sad sight for me to see and take unto my halls! Ah me! ah me! I am undone, thou city of Thessaly! My line now ends; I have no children left me in my home. Oh! the sorrows seem born to endure! What friend can I look to for relief? Ah, dear lips, and cheeks, and hands! Would thy destiny had slain the 'neath Ilium's walls beside the banks of Simois!\nCHORUS\nHad he so died, my aged lord, he had won him honour thereby, and thine had been the happier lot.\nPELEUS\nO marriage, marriage, woe to thee! thou bane of my home, thou destroyer of my city! Ah my child, my boy, would that the honour of wedding thee, fraught with evil as it was to my children and house, had not thrown o'er thee, my son, Hermione's deadly net! that the thunderbolt had slain her sooner! and that thou, rash mortal, hadst never charged the great god Phoebus with aiming that murderous shaft that spilt thy hero-father's blood!\nCHORUS\nWoe! woe! alas! With due observance of funeral rites will I begin the mourning for my dead master.\nPELEUS\nAlack and well-a-day! I take up the tearful dirge, ah me! old and wretched as I am.\nCHORUS\n'Tis Heaven's decree; God willed this heavy stroke.\nPELEUS\nO darling child, thou hast left me all alone in my halls, old and childless by thy loss.\nCHORUS\nThou shouldst have died, old sire, before thy children.\nPELEUS\nShall I not tear my hair, and smite upon my head with grievous blows? O city! of both my children hath Phoebus robbed me.\nCHORUS\nWhat evils thou hast suffered, what sorrows thou hast seen, thou poor old man! what shall be thy life hereafter?\nPELEUS\nChildless, desolate, with no limit to my grief, I must drain the cup of woe, until I die.\nCHORUS\n'Twas all in vain the gods wished thee joy on thy wedding day.\nPELEUS\nAll my hopes have flown away, fallen short of my high boasts.\nCHORUS\nA lonely dweller in a lonely home art thou.\nPELEUS\nI have no city any longer; there! on the ground my sceptre do cast; and thou, daughter of Nereus, 'neath thy dim grotto, shalt see me grovelling in the dust, a ruined king.\nCHORUS\nLook, look!\nA dim form of divine appearance is seen hovering mid air.\nWhat is that moving? what influence divine am I conscious of? Look, maidens, mark it well; see, yonder is some deity, wafted through the lustrous air and alighting on the plains of Phthia, home of steeds.\nTHETIS from above\nO Peleus! because of my wedded days with thee now long agone, I Thetis am come from the halls of Nereus. And first I counsel thee not to grieve to excess in thy present distress, for I too who need ne'er have borne children to my sorrow, have lost the child of our love, Achilles swift of foot, foremost of the sons of Hellas. Next will I declare why I am come, and do thou give ear. Carry yonder corpse, Achilles' son, to the Pythian altar and there bury it, a reproach to Delphi, that his tomb may proclaim the violent death he met at the hand of Orestes. And for his captive wife Andromache,-she must dwell in the Molossian land, united in honourable wedlock with Helenus, and with her this babe, the sole survivor as he is of all the line of Aeacus, for from him a succession of prosperous kings of Molossia is to go on unbroken; for the race that springs from thee and me, my aged lord, must not thus be brought to naught; no! nor Troy's line either; for her fate too is cared for by the gods, albeit her fall was due to the eager wish of Pallas. Thee too, that thou mayst know the saving grace of wedding me, will I, a goddess born and daughter of a god, release from all the ills that flesh is heir to and make a deity to know not death nor decay. From henceforth in the halls of Nereus shalt thou dwell with me, god and goddess together; thence shalt thou rise dry-shod from out the main and see Achilles, our dear son, settled in his island-home by the strand of Leuce, that is girdled by the Euxine sea. But get thee to Delphi's god-built town, carrying this corpse with thee, and, after thou hast buried him, return and settle in the cave which time hath hollowed in the Sepian rock and there abide, till from the sea I come with choir of fifty Nereids to be thy escort thence; for fate's decree thou must fulfil; such is the pleasure of Zeus. Cease then to mourn the dead; this is the lot which heaven assigns to all, and all must pay their debt to death.\nPELEUS\nGreat queen, my honoured wife, from Nereus sprung, all hail! thou art acting herein as befits thyself and thy children. So I will stay my grief at thy bidding, goddess, and, when I have buried the dead, will seek the glens of Pelion, even the place where I took thy beauteous form to my embrace. Surely after this every prudent man will seek to marry a wife of noble stock and give his daughter to a husband good and true, never setting his heart on a worthless woman, not even though she bring a sumptuous dowry to his house. So would men ne'er suffer ill at heaven's hand.\nTHETIS vanishes.\nCHORUS chanting\nMany are the shapes of Heaven's denizens, and many a thing they bring to pass contrary to our expectation; that which we thought would be is not accomplished, while for the unexpected God finds out a way. E'en such hath been the issue of this matter.",

    "content":"THE BACCHAE\n[Pg 6]\nCHARACTERS IN THE PLAY\nDionysus, the God; son of Zeus and of the Theban princess Semelê.\nCadmus, formerly King of Thebes, father of Semelê.\nPentheus, King of Thebes, grandson of Cadmus.\nAgâvê, daughter of Cadmus, mother of Pentheus.\nTeiresias, an aged Theban prophet.\nA Soldier of Pentheus' Guard.\nTwo Messengers.\nA Chorus of Inspired Damsels, following Dionysus from the East.\n'The play was first produced after the death of Euripides by his son, who bore the same name, together with the 'Iphigenîa in Aulis' and the 'Alcmaeon,' probably in the year 405 B.C.'\n[Pg 7]\nTHE BACCHAE\nThe background represents the front of the Castle of Pentheus, King of Thebes. At one side is visible the sacred Tomb of Semelê, a little enclosure overgrown with wild vines, with a cleft in the rocky floor of it from which there issues at times steam or smoke. The God Dionysus is discovered alone.\nDionysus.\nBehold, God's Son is come unto this land\nOf Thebes, even I, Dionysus, whom the brand\nOf heaven's hot splendour lit to life, when she\nWho bore me, Cadmus' daughter Semelê,\nDied here. So, changed in shape from God to man,\nI walk again by Dirce's streams and scan\n[Pg 8]Ismenus' shore. There by the castle side\nI see her place, the Tomb of the Lightning's Bride,\nThe wreck of smouldering chambers, and the great\nFaint wreaths of fire undying—as the hate\nDies not, that Hera held for Semelê.\nAye, Cadmus hath done well; in purity\nHe keeps this place apart, inviolate,\nHis daughter's sanctuary; and I have set\nMy green and clustered vines to robe it round.\nFar now behind me lies the golden ground\nOf Lydian and of Phrygian; far away\nThe wide hot plains where Persian sunbeams play,\nThe Bactrian war-holds, and the storm-oppressed\nClime of the Mede, and Araby the Blest,\nAnd Asia all, that by the salt sea lies\nIn proud embattled cities, motley-wise\nOf Hellene and Barbarian interwrought;\nAnd now I come to Hellas—having taught\nAll the world else my dances and my rite\nOf mysteries, to show me in men's sight\nManifest God.\nAnd first of Hellene lands\nI cry thus Thebes to waken; set her hands\nTo clasp my wand, mine ivied javelin,\nAnd round her shoulders hang my wild fawn-skin.\nFor they have scorned me whom it least beseemed,\nSemelê's sisters; mocked my birth, nor deemed\nThat Dionysus sprang from Dian seed.\nMy mother sinned, said they; and in her need,\nWith Cadmus plotting, cloaked her human shame\nWith the dread name of Zeus; for that the flame\nFrom heaven consumed her, seeing she lied to God.\nThus must they vaunt; and therefore hath my rod\n[Pg 9]On them first fallen, and stung them forth wild-eyed\nFrom empty chambers; the bare mountain side\nIs made their home, and all their hearts are flame.\nYea, I have bound upon the necks of them\nThe harness of my rites. And with them all\nThe seed of womankind from hut and hall\nOf Thebes, hath this my magic goaded out.\nAnd there, with the old King's daughters, in a rout\nConfused, they make their dwelling-place between\nThe roofless rocks and shadowy pine trees green.\nThus shall this Thebes, how sore soe'er it smart,\nLearn and forget not, till she crave her part\nIn mine adoring; thus must I speak clear\nTo save my mother's fame, and crown me here\nAs true God, born by Semelê to Zeus.\nNow Cadmus yieldeth up his throne and use\nOf royal honour to his daughter's son\nPentheus; who on my body hath begun\nA war with God. He thrusteth me away\nFrom due drink-offering, and, when men pray,\nMy name entreats not. Therefore on his own\nHead and his people's shall my power be shown.\nThen to another land, when all things here\nAre well, must I fare onward, making clear\nMy godhead's might. But should this Theban town\nEssay with wrath and battle to drag down\nMy maids, lo, in their path myself shall be,\nAnd maniac armies battled after me!\nFor this I veil my godhead with the wan\nForm of the things that die, and walk as Man.\nO Brood of Tmolus o'er the wide world flown,\nO Lydian band, my chosen and mine own,\n[Pg 10]Damsels uplifted o'er the orient deep\nTo wander where I wander, and to sleep\nWhere I sleep; up, and wake the old sweet sound,\nThe clang that I and mystic Rhea found,\nThe Timbrel of the Mountain! Gather all\nThebes to your song round Pentheus' royal hall.\nI seek my new-made worshippers, to guide\nTheir dances up Kithaeron's pine-clad side.\n[As he departs, there comes stealing in from the left a band of fifteen Eastern Women, the light of the sunrise streaming upon their long white robes and ivy-bound hair. They wear fawn-skins over the robes, and carry some of them timbrels, some pipes and other instruments. Many bear the thyrsus, or sacred Wand, made of reed ringed with ivy. They enter stealthily till they see that the place is empty, and then begin their mystic song of worship.\nChorus.\nA Maiden.\nFrom Asia, from the dayspring that uprises,\nTo Bromios ever glorying we came.\nWe laboured for our Lord in many guises;\nWe toiled, but the toil is as the prize is;\nThou Mystery, we hail thee by thy name!\nAnother.\nWho lingers in the road? Who espies us?\nHe shall hide him in his house nor be bold.\nLet the heart keep silence that defies us;\nFor I sing this day to Dionysus\nThe song that is appointed from of old.\n[Pg 11]\nAll the Maidens.\nOh, blessèd he in all wise,\nWho hath drunk the Living Fountain,\nWhose life no folly staineth,\nAnd his soul is near to God;\nWhose sins are lifted, pall-wise,\nAs he worships on the Mountain,\nAnd where Cybele ordaineth,\nOur Mother, he has trod:\nHis head with ivy laden\nAnd his thyrsus tossing high,\nFor our God he lifts his cry;\n'Up, O Bacchae, wife and maiden,\nCome, O ye Bacchae, come;\nOh, bring the Joy-bestower,\nGod-seed of God the Sower,\nBring Bromios in his power\nFrom Phrygia's mountain dome;\nTo street and town and tower,\nOh, bring ye Bromios home!'\nWhom erst in anguish lying\nFor an unborn life's desire,\nAs a dead thing in the Thunder\nHis mother cast to earth;\nFor her heart was dying, dying,\nIn the white heart of the fire;\nTill Zeus, the Lord of Wonder,\nDevised new lairs of birth;\nYea, his own flesh tore to hide him,\nAnd with clasps of bitter gold\nDid a secret son enfold,\n[Pg 12]    And the Queen knew not beside him;\nTill the perfect hour was there;\nThen a hornèd God was found,\nAnd a God with serpents crowned;\nAnd for that are serpents wound\nIn the wands his maidens bear,\nAnd the songs of serpents sound\nIn the mazes of their hair.\nSome Maidens.\nAll hail, O Thebes, thou nurse of Semelê!\nWith Semelê's wild ivy crown thy towers;\nOh, burst in bloom of wreathing bryony,\nBerries and leaves and flowers;\nUplift the dark divine wand,\nThe oak-wand and the pine-wand,\nAnd don thy fawn-skin, fringed in purity\nWith fleecy white, like ours.\nOh, cleanse thee in the wands' waving pride!\nYea, all men shall dance with us and pray,\nWhen Bromios his companies shall guide\nHillward, ever hillward, where they stay,\nThe flock of the Believing,\nThe maids from loom and weaving\nBy the magic of his breath borne away.\nOthers.\nHail thou, O Nurse of Zeus, O Caverned Haunt\nWhere fierce arms clanged to guard God's cradle rare,\nFor thee of old some crested Corybant\nFirst woke in Cretan air\n[Pg 13]      The wild orb of our orgies,\nOur Timbrel; and thy gorges\nRang with this strain; and blended Phrygian chant\nAnd sweet keen pipes were there.\nBut the Timbrel, the Timbrel was another's,\nAnd away to Mother Rhea it must wend;\nAnd to our holy singing from the Mother's\nThe mad Satyrs carried it, to blend\nIn the dancing and the cheer\nOf our third and perfect Year;\nAnd it serves Dionysus in the end!\nA Maiden.\nO glad, glad on the mountains\nTo swoon in the race outworn,\nWhen the holy fawn-skin clings,\nAnd all else sweeps away,\nTo the joy of the red quick fountains,\nThe blood of the hill-goat torn,\nThe glory of wild-beast ravenings,\nWhere the hill-tops catch the day;\nTo the Phrygian, Lydian, mountains!\n'Tis Bromios leads the way.\nAnother Maiden.\nThen streams the earth with milk, yea, streams\nWith wine and nectar of the bee,\nAnd through the air dim perfume steams\nOf Syrian frankincense; and He,\nOur leader, from his thyrsus spray\nA torchlight tosses high and higher,\nA torchlight like a beacon-fire,\nTo waken all that faint and stray;\n[Pg 14]    And sets them leaping as he sings,\nHis tresses rippling to the sky,\nAnd deep beneath the Maenad cry\nHis proud voice rings:\n'Come, O ye Bacchae, come!'\nAll the Maidens.\nHither, O fragrant of Tmolus the Golden,\nCome with the voice of timbrel and drum;\nLet the cry of your joyance uplift and embolden\nThe God of the joy-cry; O Bacchanals, come!\nWith pealing of pipes and with Phrygian clamour,\nOn, where the vision of holiness thrills,\nAnd the music climbs and the maddening glamour,\nWith the wild White Maids, to the hills, to the hills!\nOh, then, like a colt as he runs by a river,\nA colt by his dam, when the heart of him sings,\nWith the keen limbs drawn and the fleet foot a-quiver,\nAway the Bacchanal springs!\nEnter Teiresias. He is an old man and blind, leaning upon a staff and moving with slow stateliness, though wearing the Ivy and the Bacchic fawn-skin.\nTeiresias.\nHo, there, who keeps the gate?—Go, summon me\nCadmus, Agênor's son, who crossed the sea\nFrom Sidon and upreared this Theban hold.\nGo, whosoe'er thou art. See he be told\nTeiresias seeketh him. Himself will gauge\nMine errand, and the compact, age with age,\n[Pg 15]I vowed with him, grey hair with snow-white hair,\nTo deck the new God's thyrsus, and to wear\nHis fawn-skin, and with ivy crown our brows.\nEnter Cadmus from the Castle. He is even older than Teiresias, and wears the same attire.\nCadmus.\nTrue friend! I knew that voice of thine, that flows\nLike mellow wisdom from a fountain wise.\nAnd, lo, I come prepared, in all the guise\nAnd harness of this God. Are we not told\nHis is the soul of that dead life of old\nThat sprang from mine own daughter? Surely then\nMust thou and I with all the strength of men\nExalt him.\nWhere then shall I stand, where tread\nThe dance and toss this bowed and hoary head?\nO friend, in thee is wisdom; guide my grey\nAnd eld-worn steps, eld-worn Teiresias.—Nay;\nI am not weak.\n[At the first movement of worship his manner begins to change; a mysterious strength and exaltation enter into him.\nSurely this arm could smite\nThe wild earth with its thyrsus, day and night,\nAnd faint not! Sweetly and forgetfully\nThe dim years fall from off me!\nTeiresias.\nAs with thee,\nWith me 'tis likewise. Light am I and young,\nAnd will essay the dancing and the song.\n[Pg 16]\nCadmus.\nQuick, then, our chariots to the mountain road.\nTeiresias.\nNay; to take steeds were to mistrust the God.\nCadmus.\nSo be it. Mine old arm shall guide thee there.\nTeiresias.\nThe God himself shall guide! Have thou no care.\nCadmus.\nAnd in all Thebes shall no man dance but we?\nTeiresias.\nAye, Thebes is blinded. Thou and I can see.\nCadmus.\n'Tis weary waiting; hold my hand, friend; so.\nTeiresias.\nLo, there is mine. So linkèd let us go.\nCadmus.\nShall things of dust the Gods' dark ways despise?\nTeiresias.\nOr prove our wit on Heaven's high mysteries?\nNot thou and I! That heritage sublime\nOur sires have left us, wisdom old as time,\nNo word of man, how deep soe'er his thought\nAnd won of subtlest toil, may bring to naught.\n[Pg 17]  Aye, men will rail that I forget my years,\nTo dance and wreathe with ivy these white hairs;\nWhat recks it? Seeing the God no line hath told\nTo mark what man shall dance, or young or old;\nBut craves his honours from mortality\nAll, no man marked apart; and great shall be!\nCadmus (after looking away toward the Mountain).\nTeiresias, since this light thou canst not read,\nI must be seer for thee. Here comes in speed\nPentheus, Echîon's son, whom I have raised\nTo rule my people in my stead.—Amazed\nHe seems. Stand close, and mark what we shall hear.\n[The two stand back, partially concealed, while there enters in hot haste Pentheus, followed by a bodyguard. He is speaking to the Soldier in command.\nPentheus.\nScarce had I crossed our borders, when mine ear\nWas caught by this strange rumour, that our own\nWives, our own sisters, from their hearths are flown\nTo wild and secret rites; and cluster there\nHigh on the shadowy hills, with dance and prayer\nTo adore this new-made God, this Dionyse,\nWhate'er he be!—And in their companies\nDeep wine-jars stand, and ever and anon\nAway into the loneliness now one\nSteals forth, and now a second, maid or dame,\nWhere love lies waiting, not of God! The flame,\nThey say, of Bacchios wraps them. Bacchios! Nay,\n'Tis more to Aphrodite that they pray.\n[Pg 18]  Howbeit, all that I have found, my men\nHold bound and shackled in our dungeon den;\nThe rest, I will go hunt them! Aye, and snare\nMy birds with nets of iron, to quell their prayer\nAnd mountain song and rites of rascaldom!\nThey tell me, too, there is a stranger come,\nA man of charm and spell, from Lydian seas,\nA head all gold and cloudy fragrancies,\nA wine-red cheek, and eyes that hold the light\nOf the very Cyprian. Day and livelong night\nHe haunts amid the damsels, o'er each lip\nDangling his cup of joyance!—Let me grip\nHim once, but once, within these walls, right swift\nThat wand shall cease its music, and that drift\nOf tossing curls lie still—when my rude sword\nFalls between neck and trunk! 'Tis all his word,\nThis tale of Dionysus; how that same\nBabe that was blasted by the lightning flame\nWith his dead mother, for that mother's lie,\nWas re-conceived, born perfect from the thigh\nOf Zeus, and now is God! What call ye these?\nDreams? Gibes of the unknown wanderer? Blasphemies\nThat crave the very gibbet?\nStay! God wot,\nHere is another marvel! See I not\nIn motley fawn-skins robed the vision-seer\nTeiresias? And my mother's father here—\nO depth of scorn!—adoring with the wand\nOf Bacchios?—Father!—Nay, mine eyes are fond;\nIt is not your white heads so fancy-flown!\nIt cannot be! Cast off that ivy crown,\n[Pg 19]O mine own mother's sire! Set free that hand\nThat cowers about its staff.\n'Tis thou hast planned\nThis work, Teiresias! 'Tis thou must set\nAnother altar and another yet\nAmongst us, watch new birds, and win more hire\nOf gold, interpreting new signs of fire!\nBut for thy silver hairs, I tell thee true,\nThou now wert sitting chained amid thy crew\nOf raving damsels, for this evil dream\nThou hast brought us, of new Gods! When once the gleam\nOf grapes hath lit a Woman's Festival,\nIn all their prayers is no more health at all!\nLeader of the Chorus\n(the words are not heard by Pentheus).\nInjurious King, hast thou no care for God,\nNor Cadmus, sower of the Giants' Sod,\nLife-spring to great Echîon and to thee?\nTeiresias.\nGood words, my son, come easily, when he\nThat speaks is wise, and speaks but for the right.\nElse come they never! Swift are thine, and bright\nAs though with thought, yet have no thought at all.\nLo, this new God, whom thou dost flout withal,\nI cannot speak the greatness wherewith He\nIn Hellas shall be great! Two spirits there be,\nYoung Prince, that in man's world are first of worth.\nDêmêtêr one is named; she is the Earth—\nCall her which name thou will!—who feeds man's frame\nWith sustenance of things dry. And that which came\n[Pg 20]Her work to perfect, second, is the Power\nFrom Semelê born. He found the liquid shower\nHid in the grape. He rests man's spirit dim\nFrom grieving, when the vine exalteth him.\nHe giveth sleep to sink the fretful day\nIn cool forgetting. Is there any way\nWith man's sore heart, save only to forget?\nYea, being God, the blood of him is set\nBefore the Gods in sacrifice, that we\nFor his sake may be blest.—And so, to thee,\nThat fable shames him, how this God was knit\nInto God's flesh? Nay, learn the truth of it,\nCleared from the false.—When from that deadly light\nZeus saved the babe, and up to Olympus' height\nRaised him, and Hera's wrath would cast him thence,\nThen Zeus devised him a divine defence.\nA fragment of the world-encircling fire\nHe rent apart, and wrought to his desire\nOf shape and hue, in the image of the child,\nAnd gave to Hera's rage. And so, beguiled\nBy change and passing time, this tale was born,\nHow the babe-god was hidden in the torn\nFlesh of his sire. He hath no shame thereby.\nA prophet is he likewise. Prophecy\nCleaves to all frenzy, but beyond all else\nTo frenzy of prayer. Then in us verily dwells\nThe God himself, and speaks the thing to be.\nYea, and of Ares' realm a part hath he.\nWhen mortal armies, mailèd and arrayed,\nHave in strange fear, or ever blade met blade,\nFled maddened, 'tis this God hath palsied them.\nAye, over Delphi's rock-built diadem\n[Pg 21]Thou yet shalt see him leaping with his train\nOf fire across the twin-peaked mountain-plain,\nFlaming the darkness with his mystic wand,\nAnd great in Hellas.—List and understand,\nKing Pentheus! Dream not thou that force is power;\nNor, if thou hast a thought, and that thought sour\nAnd sick, oh, dream not thought is wisdom!—Up,\nReceive this God to Thebes; pour forth the cup\nOf sacrifice, and pray, and wreathe thy brow.\nThou fearest for the damsels? Think thee now;\nHow toucheth this the part of Dionyse\nTo hold maids pure perforce? In them it lies,\nAnd their own hearts; and in the wildest rite\nCometh no stain to her whose heart is white.\nNay, mark me! Thou hast thy joy, when the Gate\nStands thronged, and Pentheus' name is lifted great\nAnd high by Thebes in clamour; shall not He\nRejoice in his due meed of majesty?\nHowbeit, this Cadmus whom thou scorn'st and I\nWill wear His crown, and tread His dances! Aye,\nOur hairs are white, yet shall that dance be trod!\nI will not lift mine arm to war with God\nFor thee nor all thy words. Madness most fell\nIs on thee, madness wrought by some dread spell,\nBut not by spell nor leechcraft to be cured!\nChorus.\nGrey prophet, worthy of Phoebus is thy word,\nAnd wise in honouring Bromios, our great God.\nCadmus.\nMy son, right well Teiresias points thy road.\nOh, make thine habitation here with us,\nNot lonely, against men's uses. Hazardous\n[Pg 22]Is this quick bird-like beating of thy thought\nWhere no thought dwells.—Grant that this God be naught,\nYet let that Naught be Somewhat in thy mouth;\nLie boldly, and say He Is! So north and south\nShall marvel, how there sprang a thing divine\nFrom Semelê's flesh, and honour all our line.\n[Drawing nearer to Pentheus.\nIs there not blood before thine eyes even now?\nOur lost Actaeon's blood, whom long ago\nHis own red hounds through yonder forest dim\nTore unto death, because he vaunted him\nAgainst most holy Artemis? Oh, beware,\nAnd let me wreathe thy temples. Make thy prayer\nWith us, and walk thee humbly in God's sight.\n[He makes as if to set the wreath on Pentheus' head.\nPentheus.\nDown with that hand! Aroint thee to thy rite,\nNor smear on me thy foul contagion!\n[Turning upon Teiresias.\nThis\nThy folly's head and prompter shall not miss\nThe justice that he needs!—Go, half my guard,\nForth to the rock-seat where he dwells in ward\nO'er birds and wonders; rend the stone with crow\nAnd trident; make one wreck of high and low,\nAnd toss his bands to all the winds of air!\nHa, have I found the way to sting thee, there?\nThe rest, forth through the town! And seek amain\nThis girl-faced stranger, that hath wrought such bane\nTo all Thebes, preying on our maids and wives.\nSeek till ye find; and lead him here in gyves,\nTill he be judged and stoned, and weep in blood\nThe day he troubled Pentheus with his God!\n[The guards set forth in two bodies; Pentheus goes into the Castle.\n[Pg 23]\nTeiresias.\nHard heart, how little dost thou know what seed\nThou sowest! Blind before, and now indeed\nMost mad!—Come, Cadmus, let us go our way,\nAnd pray for this our persecutor, pray\nFor this poor city, that the righteous God\nMove not in anger.—Take thine ivy rod\nAnd help my steps, as I help thine. 'Twere ill,\nIf two old men should fall by the roadway. Still,\nCome what come may, our service shall be done\nTo Bacchios, the All-Father's mystic son.\nO Pentheus, named of sorrow! Shall he claim\nFrom all thy house fulfilment of his name,\nOld Cadmus?—Nay, I speak not from mine art,\nBut as I see—blind words and a blind heart!\n[The two Old Men go off towards the Mountain.\nChorus.\nSome Maidens.\nThou Immaculate on high;\nThou Recording Purity;\nThou that stoopest, Golden Wing,\nEarthward, manward, pitying,\nHearest thou this angry King?\nHearest thou the rage and scorn\n'Gainst the Lord of Many Voices,\nHim of mortal mother born,\nHim in whom man's heart rejoices,\n[Pg 24]        Girt with garlands and with glee,\nFirst in Heaven's sovranty?\nFor his kingdom, it is there,\nIn the dancing and the prayer,\nIn the music and the laughter,\nIn the vanishing of care,\nAnd of all before and after;\nIn the Gods' high banquet, when\nGleams the grape-blood, flashed to heaven;\nYea, and in the feasts of men\nComes his crownèd slumber; then\nPain is dead and hate forgiven!\nOthers.\nLoose thy lips from out the rein;\nLift thy wisdom to disdain;\nWhatso law thou canst not see,\nScorning; so the end shall be\nUttermost calamity!\n'Tis the life of quiet breath,\n'Tis the simple and the true,\nStorm nor earthquake shattereth,\nNor shall aught the house undo\nWhere they dwell. For, far away,\nHidden from the eyes of day,\nWatchers are there in the skies,\nThat can see man's life, and prize\nDeeds well done by things of clay.\nBut the world's Wise are not wise,\nClaiming more than mortal may.\nLife is such a little thing;\nLo, their present is departed,\n[Pg 25]        And the dreams to which they cling\nCome not. Mad imagining\nTheirs, I ween, and empty-hearted!\nDivers Maidens.\nWhere is the Home for me?\nO Cyprus, set in the sea,\nAphrodite's home In the soft sea-foam,\nWould I could wend to thee;\nWhere the wings of the Loves are furled,\nAnd faint the heart of the world.\nAye, unto Paphos' isle,\nWhere the rainless meadows smile\nWith riches rolled From the hundred-fold\nMouths of the far-off Nile,\nStreaming beneath the waves\nTo the roots of the seaward caves.\nBut a better land is there\nWhere Olympus cleaves the air,\nThe high still dell Where the Muses dwell,\nFairest of all things fair!\nO there is Grace, and there is the Heart's Desire.\nAnd peace to adore thee, thou Spirit of Guiding Fire!\nA God of Heaven is he,\nAnd born in majesty;\nYet hath he mirth In the joy of the Earth,\nAnd he loveth constantly\nHer who brings increase,\nThe Feeder of Children, Peace.\n[Pg 26]        No grudge hath he of the great;\nNo scorn of the mean estate;\nBut to all that liveth His wine he giveth,\nGriefless, immaculate;\nOnly on them that spurn\nJoy, may his anger burn.\nLove thou the Day and the Night;\nBe glad of the Dark and the Light;\nAnd avert thine eyes From the lore of the wise,\nThat have honour in proud men's sight.\nThe simple nameless herd of Humanity\nHath deeds and faith that are truth enough for me!\n[As the Chorus ceases, a party of the guards return, leading in the midst of them Dionysus, bound. The Soldier in command stands forth, as Pentheus, hearing the tramp of feet, comes out from the Castle.\nSoldier.\nOur quest is finished, and thy prey, O King,\nCaught; for the chase was swift, and this wild thing\nMost tame; yet never flinched, nor thought to flee,\nBut held both hands out unresistingly—\nNo change, no blanching of the wine-red cheek.\nHe waited while we came, and bade us wreak\nAll thy decree; yea, laughed, and made my hest\nEasy, till I for very shame confessed\nAnd said: 'O stranger, not of mine own will\nI bind thee, but his bidding to fulfil\nWho sent me.'\nAnd those prisoned Maids withal\nWhom thou didst seize and bind within the wall\n[Pg 27]Of thy great dungeon, they are fled, O King,\nFree in the woods, a-dance and glorying\nTo Bromios. Of their own impulse fell\nTo earth, men say, fetter and manacle,\nAnd bars slid back untouched of mortal hand.\nYea, full of many wonders to thy land\nIs this man come. . . .

He overthrew\nAll that high house. And there in wreck for evermore it lies,\nThat the day of this my bondage may be sore in Pentheus' eyes!\nAnd now his sword is fallen, and he lies outworn and wan\nWho dared to rise against his God in wrath, being but man.\nAnd I uprose and left him, and in all peace took my path\nForth to my Chosen, recking light of Pentheus and his wrath.\nBut soft, methinks a footstep sounds even now within the hall;\n[Pg 40]'Tis he; how think ye he will stand, and what words speak withal?\nI will endure him gently, though he come in fury hot.\nFor still are the ways of Wisdom, and her temper trembleth not!\nEnter Pentheus in fury.\nPentheus.\nIt is too much!

Yet\nI first would learn thy pleasure. Shall I set\nMy whole tale forth, or veil the stranger part?\nYea, Lord, I fear the swiftness of thy heart,\nThine edgèd wrath and more than royal soul.\nPentheus.\nThy tale shall nothing scathe thee.—Tell the whole.\nIt skills not to be wroth with honesty.\nNay, if thy news of them be dark, 'tis he\nShall pay it, who bewitched and led them on.\nMessenger.\nOur herded kine were moving in the dawn\nUp to the peaks, the greyest, coldest time,\nWhen the first rays steal earthward, and the rime\nYields, when I saw three bands of them. The one\nAutonoë led, one Ino, one thine own\nMother, Agâvê. There beneath the trees\nSleeping they lay, like wild things flung at ease\nIn the forest; one half sinking on a bed\nOf deep pine greenery; one with careless head\nAmid the fallen oak leaves; all most cold\nIn purity—not as thy tale was told\nOf wine-cups and wild music and the chase\nFor love amid the forest's loneliness.\nThen rose the Queen Agâvê suddenly\nAmid her band, and gave the God's wild cry,\n'Awake, ye Bacchanals! I hear the sound\nOf hornèd kine. Awake ye!'—Then, all round,\nAlert, the warm sleep fallen from their eyes,\nA marvel of swift ranks I saw them rise,\n[Pg 43]Dames young and old, and gentle maids unwed\nAmong them. O'er their shoulders first they shed\nTheir tresses, and caught up the fallen fold\nOf mantles where some clasp had loosened hold,\nAnd girt the dappled fawn-skins in with long\nQuick snakes that hissed and writhed with quivering tongue.\nAnd one a young fawn held, and one a wild\nWolf cub, and fed them with white milk, and smiled\nIn love, young mothers with a mother's breast\nAnd babes at home forgotten! Then they pressed\nWreathed ivy round their brows, and oaken sprays\nAnd flowering bryony. And one would raise\nHer wand and smite the rock, and straight a jet\nOf quick bright water came. Another set\nHer thyrsus in the bosomed earth, and there\nWas red wine that the God sent up to her,\nA darkling fountain. And if any lips\nSought whiter draughts, with dipping finger-tips\nThey pressed the sod, and gushing from the ground\nCame springs of milk. And reed-wands ivy-crowned\nRan with sweet honey, drop by drop.—O King,\nHadst thou been there, as I, and seen this thing,\nWith prayer and most high wonder hadst thou gone\nTo adore this God whom now thou rail'st upon!\nHowbeit, the kine-wardens and shepherds straight\nCame to one place, amazed, and held debate;\nAnd one being there who walked the streets and scanned\nThe ways of speech, took lead of them whose hand\nKnew but the slow soil and the solemn hill,\nAnd flattering spoke, and asked: 'Is it your will,\nMasters, we stay the mother of the King,\nAgâvê, from her lawless worshipping,\n[Pg 44]And win us royal thanks?'—And this seemed good\nTo all; and through the branching underwood\nWe hid us, cowering in the leaves. And there\nThrough the appointed hour they made their prayer\nAnd worship of the Wand, with one accord\nOf heart and cry—'Iacchos, Bromios, Lord,\nGod of God born!'—And all the mountain felt,\nAnd worshipped with them; and the wild things knelt\nAnd ramped and gloried, and the wilderness\nWas filled with moving voices and dim stress.\nSoon, as it chanced, beside my thicket-close\nThe Queen herself passed dancing, and I rose\nAnd sprang to seize her. But she turned her face\nUpon me: 'Ho, my rovers of the chase,\nMy wild White Hounds, we are hunted! Up, each rod\nAnd follow, follow, for our Lord and God!'\nThereat, for fear they tear us, all we fled\nAmazed; and on, with hand unweaponèd\nThey swept toward our herds that browsed the green\nHill grass. Great uddered kine then hadst thou seen\nBellowing in sword-like hands that cleave and tear,\nA live steer riven asunder, and the air\nTossed with rent ribs or limbs of cloven tread,\nAnd flesh upon the branches, and a red\nRain from the deep green pines. Yea, bulls of pride,\nHorns swift to rage, were fronted and aside\nFlung stumbling, by those multitudinous hands\nDragged pitilessly. And swifter were the bands\nOf garbèd flesh and bone unbound withal\nThan on thy royal eyes the lids may fall.\nThen on like birds, by their own speed upborne,\nThey swept toward the plains of waving corn\n[Pg 45]That lie beside Asopus' banks, and bring\nTo Thebes the rich fruit of her harvesting.\nOn Hysiae and Erythrae that lie nursed\nAmid Kithaeron's bowering rocks, they burst\nDestroying, as a foeman's army comes.\nThey caught up little children from their homes,\nHigh on their shoulders, babes unheld, that swayed\nAnd laughed and fell not; all a wreck they made;\nYea, bronze and iron did shatter, and in play\nStruck hither and thither, yet no wound had they;\nCaught fire from out the hearths, yea, carried hot\nFlames in their tresses and were scorchèd not!\nThe village folk in wrath took spear and sword,\nAnd turned upon the Bacchae. Then, dread Lord,\nThe wonder was. For spear nor barbèd brand\nCould scathe nor touch the damsels; but the Wand,\nThe soft and wreathèd wand their white hands sped,\nBlasted those men and quelled them, and they fled\nDizzily. Sure some God was in these things!\nAnd the holy women back to those strange springs\nReturned, that God had sent them when the day\nDawned, on the upper heights; and washed away\nThe stain of battle. And those girdling snakes\nHissed out to lap the waterdrops from cheeks\nAnd hair and breast.\nTherefore I counsel thee,\nO King, receive this Spirit, whoe'er he be,\nTo Thebes in glory. Greatness manifold\nIs all about him; and the tale is told\nThat this is he who first to man did give\nThe grief-assuaging vine. Oh, let him live;\nFor if he die, then Love herself is slain,\nAnd nothing joyous in the world again!\n[Pg 46]\nLeader.\nAlbeit I tremble, and scarce may speak my thought\nTo a king's face, yet will I hide it not.\nDionyse is God, no God more true nor higher!\nPentheus.\nIt bursts hard by us, like a smothered fire,\nThis frenzy of Bacchic women! All my land\nIs made their mock.—This needs an iron hand!\nHo, Captain! Quick to the Electran Gate;\nBid gather all my men-at-arms thereat;\nCall all that spur the charger, all who know\nTo wield the orbèd targe or bend the bow;\nWe march to war!—'Fore God, shall women dare\nSuch deeds against us? 'Tis too much to bear!\nDionysus.\nThou mark'st me not, O King, and holdest light\nMy solemn words; yet, in thine own despite,\nI warn thee still. Lift thou not up thy spear\nAgainst a God, but hold thy peace, and fear\nHis wrath! He will not brook it, if thou fright\nHis Chosen from the hills of their delight.\nPentheus.\nPeace, thou! And if for once thou hast slipped thy chain,\nGive thanks!—Or shall I knot thine arms again?\nDionysus.\nBetter to yield him prayer and sacrifice\nThan kick against the pricks, since Dionyse\nIs God, and thou but mortal.\n[Pg 47]\nPentheus.\nThat will I!\nYea, sacrifice of women's blood, to cry\nHis name through all Kithaeron!\nDionysus.\nYe shall fly,\nAll, and abase your shields of bronzen rim\nBefore their wands.\nPentheus.\nThere is no way with him,\nThis stranger that so dogs us! Well or ill\nI may entreat him, he must babble still!\nDionysus.\nWait, good my friend! These crooked matters may\nEven yet be straightened.\n[Pentheus has started as though to seek his army at the gate.\nPentheus.\nAye, if I obey\nMine own slaves' will; how else?\nDionysus.\nMyself will lead\nThe damsels hither, without sword or steed.\nPentheus.\nHow now?—This is some plot against me!\nDionysus.\nWhat\nDost fear? Only to save thee do I plot.\n[Pg 48]\nPentheus.\nIt is some compact ye have made, whereby\nTo dance these hills for ever!\nDionysus.\nVerily,\nThat is my compact, plighted with my Lord!\nPentheus (turning from him).\nHo, armourers! Bring forth my shield and sword!—\nAnd thou, be silent!\nDionysus\n(after regarding him fixedly, speaks with resignation).\nAh!—Have then thy will!\n[He fixes his eyes upon Pentheus again, while the armourers bring out his armour; then speaks in a tone of command.\nMan, thou wouldst fain behold them on the hill\nPraying!\nPentheus\n(who during the rest of this scene, with a few exceptions, simply speaks the thoughts that Dionysus puts into him, losing power over his own mind).\nThat would I, though it cost me all\nThe gold of Thebes!\nDionysus.\nSo much? Thou art quick to fall\nTo such great longing.\nPentheus\n(somewhat bewildered at what he has said).\nAye; 'twould grieve me much\nTo see them flown with wine.\n[Pg 49]\nDionysus.\nYet cravest thou such\nA sight as would much grieve thee?\nPentheus.\nYes; I fain\nWould watch, ambushed among the pines.\nDionysus.\n'Twere vain\nTo hide. They soon will track thee out.\nPentheus.\nWell said!\n'Twere best done openly.\nDionysus.\nWilt thou be led\nBy me, and try the venture?\nPentheus.\nAye, indeed!\nLead on. Why should we tarry?\nDionysus.\nFirst we need\nA rich and trailing robe of fine-linen\nTo gird thee.\nPentheus.\nNay; am I a woman, then,\nAnd no man more?\nDionysus.\nWouldst have them slay thee dead?\nNo man may see their mysteries.\n[Pg 50]\nPentheus.\nWell said!—\nI marked thy subtle temper long ere now.\nDionysus.\n'Tis Dionyse that prompteth me.\nPentheus.\nAnd how\nMean'st thou the further plan?\nDionysus.\nFirst take thy way\nWithin. I will array thee.\nPentheus.\nWhat array?\nThe woman's? Nay, I will not.\nDionysus.\nDoth it change\nSo soon, all thy desire to see this strange\nAdoring?\nPentheus.\nWait! What garb wilt thou bestow\nAbout me?\nDionysus.\nFirst a long tress dangling low\nBeneath thy shoulders.\nPentheus.\nAye, and next?\n[Pg 51]\nDionysus.\nThe said\nRobe, falling to thy feet; and on thine head\nA snood.\nPentheus.\nAnd after? Hast thou aught beyond?\nDionysus.\nSurely; the dappled fawn-skin and the wand.\nPentheus (after a struggle with himself).\nEnough! I cannot wear a robe and snood.\nDionysus.\nWouldst liefer draw the sword and spill men's blood?\nPentheus (again doubting).\nTrue, that were evil.—Aye; 'tis best to go\nFirst to some place of watch.\nDionysus.\nFar wiser so,\nThan seek by wrath wrath's bitter recompense.\nPentheus.\nWhat of the city streets? Canst lead me hence\nUnseen of any?\nDionysus.\nLonely and untried\nThy path from hence shall be, and I thy guide!\nPentheus.\nI care for nothing, so these Bacchanals\nTriumph not against me! . . . Forward to my halls\nWithin!—I will ordain what seemeth best.\n[Pg 52]\nDionysus.\nSo be it, O King!

And there\nThe Maenad maidens sate; in toil they were,\nBusily glad. Some with an ivy chain\nTracked a worn wand to toss its locks again;\nSome, wild in joyance, like young steeds set free,\nMade answering songs of mystic melody.\nBut my poor master saw not the great band\nBefore him. 'Stranger,' cried he, 'where we stand\n[Pg 64]Mine eyes can reach not these false saints of thine.\nMount we the bank, or some high-shouldered pine,\nAnd I shall see their follies clear!' At that\nThere came a marvel. For the Stranger straight\nTouched a great pine-tree's high and heavenward crown,\nAnd lower, lower, lower, urged it down\nTo the herbless floor. Round like a bending bow,\nOr slow wheel's rim a joiner forces to,\nSo in those hands that tough and mountain stem\nBowed slow—oh, strength not mortal dwelt in them!—\nTo the very earth. And there he set the King,\nAnd slowly, lest it cast him in its spring,\nLet back the young and straining tree, till high\nIt towered again amid the towering sky;\nAnd Pentheus in the branches! Well, I ween,\nHe saw the Maenads then, and well was seen!\nFor scarce was he aloft, when suddenly\nThere was no Stranger any more with me,\nBut out of Heaven a Voice—oh, what voice else?—\n'Twas He that called! 'Behold, O damosels,\nI bring ye him who turneth to despite\nBoth me and ye, and darkeneth my great Light.\n'Tis yours to avenge!' So spake he, and there came\n'Twixt earth and sky a pillar of high flame.\nAnd silence took the air, and no leaf stirred\nIn all the forest dell. Thou hadst not heard\nIn that vast silence any wild thing's cry.\nAnd up they sprang; but with bewildered eye,\nAgaze and listening, scarce yet hearing true.\nThen came the Voice again. And when they knew\nTheir God's clear call, old Cadmus' royal brood,\nUp, like wild pigeons startled in a wood,\n[Pg 65]On flying feet they came, his mother blind,\nAgâvê, and her sisters, and behind\nAll the wild crowd, more deeply maddened then,\nThrough the angry rocks and torrent-tossing glen,\nUntil they spied him in the dark pine-tree:\nThen climbed a crag hard by and furiously\nSome sought to stone him, some their wands would fling\nLance-wise aloft, in cruel targeting.\nBut none could strike. The height o'ertopped their rage,\nAnd there he clung, unscathed, as in a cage\nCaught. And of all their strife no end was found.\nThen, 'Hither,' cried Agâvê; 'stand we round\nAnd grip the stem, my Wild Ones, till we take\nThis climbing cat-o'-the-mount! He shall not make\nA tale of God's high dances!' Out then shone\nArm upon arm, past count, and closed upon\nThe pine, and gripped; and the ground gave, and down\nIt reeled. And that high sitter from the crown\nOf the green pine-top, with a shrieking cry\nFell, as his mind grew clear, and there hard by\nWas horror visible. 'Twas his mother stood\nO'er him, first priestess of those rites of blood.\nHe tore the coif, and from his head away\nFlung it, that she might know him, and not slay\nTo her own misery. He touched the wild\nCheek, crying: 'Mother, it is I, thy child,\nThy Pentheus, born thee in Echîon's hall!\nHave mercy, Mother! Let it not befall\nThrough sin of mine, that thou shouldst slay thy son!'\nBut she, with lips a-foam and eyes that run\nLike leaping fire, with thoughts that ne'er should be\nOn earth, possessed by Bacchios utterly,\n[Pg 66]Stays not nor hears. Round his left arm she put\nBoth hands, set hard against his side her foot,\nDrew . . . and the shoulder severed!—Not by might\nOf arm, but easily, as the God made light\nHer hand's essay. And at the other side\nWas Ino rending; and the torn flesh cried,\nAnd on Autonoë pressed, and all the crowd\nOf ravening arms. Yea, all the air was loud\nWith groans that faded into sobbing breath,\nDim shrieks, and joy, and triumph-cries of death.\nAnd here was borne a severed arm, and there\nA hunter's booted foot; white bones lay bare\nWith rending; and swift hands ensanguinèd\nTossed as in sport the flesh of Pentheus dead.\nHis body lies afar. The precipice\nHath part, and parts in many an interstice\nLurk of the tangled woodland—no light quest\nTo find. And, ah, the head! Of all the rest,\nHis mother hath it, pierced upon a wand,\nAs one might pierce a lion's, and through the land,\nLeaving her sisters in their dancing place,\nBears it on high! Yea, to these walls her face\nWas set, exulting in her deed of blood,\nCalling upon her Bromios, her God,\nHer Comrade, Fellow-Render of the Prey,\nHer All-Victorious, to whom this day\nShe bears in triumph . . . her own broken heart!\nFor me, after that sight, I will depart\nBefore Agâvê comes.—Oh, to fulfil\nGod's laws, and have no thought beyond His will,\nIs man's best treasure. Aye, and wisdom true,\nMethinks, for things of dust to cleave unto!\n[The Messenger departs into the Castle.\n[Pg 67]\nChorus.\nSome Maidens.\nWeave ye the dance, and call\nPraise to God!\nBless ye the Tyrant's fall!\nDown is trod\nPentheus, the Dragon's Seed!\nWore he the woman's weed?\nClasped he his death indeed,\nClasped the rod?\nA Bacchanal.\nYea, the wild ivy lapt him, and the doomed\nWild Bull of Sacrifice before him loomed!\nOthers.\nYe who did Bromios scorn,\nPraise Him the more,\nBacchanals, Cadmus-born;\nPraise with sore\nAgony, yea, with tears!\nGreat are the gifts he bears!\nHands that a mother rears\nRed with gore!\nLeader.\nBut stay, Agâvê cometh!

    "title":"Cyclops by Euripedes: Sicily at Mount Aetna",
    "content":"THE CYCLOPS OF EURIPIDES\nA SPECIMEN OF THE SATYRIC DRAMA\nScene: Sicily, in front of cave of the Cyclops, Polyphemus.\nPrologue by Silenus, the rural demi-god, who recounts his faithful service to Bacchus, and yet the ungrateful god has let himself and his children fall into this slavery to the horrid Cyclops Polyphemus, where, worst of their many woes, they are debarred from the wine they worship.\nParode: The Chorus of Satyrs driving their goats and lamenting how different this from the merry service of Bacchus.\nEpisode I. Silenus hurries back with the news that a ship is approaching to water in the island: fresh victims for the monster. Enter Ulysses and crew: mutual explanations, all couched in 'burlesque' tone. The mariners have had no food except flesh, and gladly partake milk and fruits of the Satyrs, affording in return to Silenus the long-lost luxury of wine: the scene then going on to paint [with the utmost coarseness] the oncoming of drunkenness.\nSuddenly enter Polyphemus: Ulysses and the crew hide. After some rough bandying between the Monster and the Chorus, the strangers are discovered: and Silenus, to save himself, turns traitor, and tells Polyphemus how they have beaten him because he would not let them steal, also what dire woes they were going to work upon Polyphemus. In spite of their protests Silenus is believed: Ulysses promises, if set free, to erect shrines in Greece for the Cyclops, besides dwelling upon the impiety of attacking innocent strangers: Polyphemus replies that he does not care for shrines, and as for impiety he is independent of Zeus; which gives occasion for a glorification of the life of nature. They are driven into the cave to be fed on at leisure.\nChoral Ode: General disgust at the monster.\nEpisode II. Ulysses [apparently standing at the mouth of the cave] describes Polyphemus gorging—then details his plan of deliverance by aid of the wine.\nChoral Ode: Lyric delight of Chorus at prospect of deliverance.\nEpisode III. The Cyclops appears sated with his banquet, and settling down to this new treat of drinking—the effects of on-coming intoxication are painted again in Polyphemus, with the usual coarseness—a farcical climax being reached when the monster begins to be affectionate to his cup-bearer, old Silenus, in memory of Zeus and his famous cup-bearer, Ganymede.\nChoral Ode: Anticipation of Revenge.\nExodus. The plan of Revenge, the boring out of the Cyclops's one eye while overpowered with drink, is carried out—various farcical effects by the way, e.g., the Chorus drawing back with excuses and leaving Ulysses to do the deed at the critical moment. The Drama ends with the Monster's rage and vain attempts to catch the culprit, Ulysses putting him off with his feigned name 'No man': thus all are delivered.",

The play was first acted when Pythodôrus was Archon, Olympiad 87, year 1 (B.C. 431). Euphorion was first, Sophocles second, Euripides third, with Medea, Philoctêtes, Dictys, and the Harvesters, a Satyr-play.\n[Pg 3]\nMEDEA\nThe Scene represents the front of Medea's House in Corinth. A road to the right leads towards the royal castle, one on the left to the harbour. The Nurse is discovered alone.\nNurse.\nWould God no Argo e'er had winged the seas\nTo Colchis through the blue Symplêgades:\nNo shaft of riven pine in Pêlion's glen\nShaped that first oar-blade in the hands of men\nValiant, who won, to save King Pelias' vow,\nThe fleece All-golden! Never then, I trow,\nMine own princess, her spirit wounded sore\nWith love of Jason, to the encastled shore\nHad sailed of old Iôlcos: never wrought\nThe daughters of King Pelias, knowing not,\nTo spill their father's life: nor fled in fear,\nHunted for that fierce sin, to Corinth here\nWith Jason and her babes. This folk at need\nStood friend to her, and she in word and deed\nServed alway Jason. Surely this doth bind,\nThrough all ill days, the hurts of humankind,\nWhen man and woman in one music move.\nBut now, the world is angry, and true love\nSick as with poison. Jason doth forsake\nMy mistress and his own two sons, to make\n[Pg 4]  His couch in a king's chamber. He must wed:\nWed with this Creon's child, who now is head\nAnd chief of Corinth. Wherefore sore betrayed\nMedea calleth up the oath they made,\nThey two, and wakes the claspèd hands again,\nThe troth surpassing speech, and cries amain\nOn God in heaven to mark the end, and how\nJason hath paid his debt.\nAll fasting now\nAnd cold, her body yielded up to pain,\nHer days a waste of weeping, she hath lain,\nSince first she knew that he was false. Her eyes\nAre lifted not; and all her visage lies\nIn the dust. If friends will speak, she hears no more\nThan some dead rock or wave that beats the shore:\nOnly the white throat in a sudden shame\nMay writhe, and all alone she moans the name\nOf father, and land, and home, forsook that day\nFor this man's sake, who casteth her away.\nNot to be quite shut out from home . . . alas,\nShe knoweth now how rare a thing that was!\nMethinks she hath a dread, not joy, to see\nHer children near. 'Tis this that maketh me\nMost tremble, lest she do I know not what.\nHer heart is no light thing, and useth not\nTo brook much wrong. I know that woman, aye,\nAnd dread her! Will she creep alone to die\nBleeding in that old room, where still is laid\nLord Jason's bed? She hath for that a blade\nMade keen. Or slay the bridegroom and the king,\nAnd win herself God knows what direr thing?\n[Pg 5]  'Tis a fell spirit. Few, I ween, shall stir\nHer hate unscathed, or lightly humble her.\nHa! 'Tis the children from their games again,\nRested and gay; and all their mother's pain\nForgotten! Young lives ever turn from gloom!\n[The Children and their Attendant come in.\nAttendant.\nThou ancient treasure of my lady's room,\nWhat mak'st thou here before the gates alone,\nAnd alway turning on thy lips some moan\nOf old mischances? Will our mistress be\nContent, this long time to be left by thee?\nNurse.\nGrey guard of Jason's children, a good thrall\nHath his own grief, if any hurt befall\nHis masters. Aye, it holds one's heart! . . .\nMeseems\nI have strayed out so deep in evil dreams,\nI longed to rest me here alone, and cry\nMedea's wrongs to this still Earth and Sky.\nAttendant.\nHow? Are the tears yet running in her eyes?\nNurse.\n'Twere good to be like thee! . . . Her sorrow lies\nScarce wakened yet, not half its perils wrought.\nAttendant.\n[Pg 6]Mad spirit! . . . if a man may speak his thought\nOf masters mad.—And nothing in her ears\nHath sounded yet of her last cause for tears!\n[He moves towards the house, but the Nurse checks him.\nNurse.\nWhat cause, old man? . . . Nay, grudge me not one word.\nAttendant.\n'Tis nothing. Best forget what thou hast heard.\nNurse.\nNay, housemate, by thy beard! Hold it not hid\nFrom me. . . . I will keep silence if thou bid.\nAttendant.\nI heard an old man talking, where he sate\nAt draughts in the sun, beside the fountain gate,\nAnd never thought of me, there standing still\nBeside him. And he said, 'Twas Creon's will,\nBeing lord of all this land, that she be sent,\nAnd with her her two sons, to banishment.\nMaybe 'tis all false. For myself, I know\nNo further, and I would it were not so.\nNurse.\nJason will never bear it--his own sons\nBanished,—however hot his anger runs\nAgainst their mother!\n[Pg 7]Attendant.\nOld love burneth low\nWhen new love wakes, men say. He is not now\nHusband nor father here, nor any kin.\nNurse.\nBut this is ruin! New waves breaking in\nTo wreck us, ere we are righted from the old!\nAttendant.\nWell, hold thy peace. Our mistress will be told\nAll in good time. Speak thou no word hereof.\nNurse.\nMy babes! What think ye of your father's love?\nGod curse him not, he is my master still:\nBut, oh, to them that loved him, 'tis an ill\nFriend. . . .\nAttendant.\nAnd what man on earth is different? How?\nHast thou lived all these years, and learned but now\nThat every man more loveth his own head\nThan other men's? He dreameth of the bed\nOf this new bride, and thinks not of his sons.\nNurse.\nGo: run into the house, my little ones:\nAll will end happily! . . . Keep them apart:\nLet not their mother meet them while her heart\n[Pg 8]Is darkened. Yester night I saw a flame\nStand in her eye, as though she hated them,\nAnd would I know not what. For sure her wrath\nWill never turn nor slumber, till she hath . . .\nGo: and if some must suffer, may it be\nNot we who love her, but some enemy!\nVoice (within).\nOh shame and pain: O woe is me!\nWould I could die in my misery!\n[The Children and the Attendant go in.\nNurse.\nAh, children, hark! She moves again\nHer frozen heart, her sleeping wrath.\nIn, quick! And never cross her path,\nNor rouse that dark eye in its pain;\nThat fell sea-spirit, and the dire\nSpring of a will untaught, unbowed.\nQuick, now!—Methinks this weeping cloud\nHath in its heart some thunder-fire,\nSlow gathering, that must flash ere long.\nI know not how, for ill or well,\nIt turns, this uncontrollable\nTempestuous spirit, blind with wrong.\nVoice (within).\nHave I not suffered? Doth it call\nNo tears? . . . Ha, ye beside the wall\nUnfathered children, God hate you\nAs I am hated, and him, too,\nThat gat you, and this house and all!\n[Pg 9]Nurse.\nFor pity! What have they to do,\nBabes, with their father's sin? Why call\nThy curse on these? . . . Ah, children, all\nThese days my bosom bleeds for you.\nRude are the wills of princes: yea,\nPrevailing alway, seldom crossed,\nOn fitful winds their moods are tossed:\n'Tis best men tread the equal way.\nAye, not with glory but with peace\nMay the long summers find me crowned:\nFor gentleness—her very sound\nIs magic, and her usages.\nAll wholesome: but the fiercely great\nHath little music on his road,\nAnd falleth, when the hand of God\nShall move, most deep and desolate.\n[During the last words the Leader of the Chorus has entered. Other women follow her.\nLeader.\nI heard a voice and a moan,\nA voice of the eastern seas:\nHath she found not yet her ease?\nSpeak, O agèd one.\nFor I stood afar at the gate,\nAnd there came from within a cry,\n[Pg 10]             And wailing desolate.\nAh, no more joy have I,\nFor the griefs this house doth see,\nAnd the love it hath wrought in me.\nNurse.\nThere is no house! 'Tis gone. The lord\nSeeketh a prouder bed: and she\nWastes in her chamber, not one word\nWill hear of care or charity.\nVoice (within).\nO Zeus, O Earth, O Light,\nWill the fire not stab my brain?\nWhat profiteth living? Oh,\nShall I not lift the slow\nYoke, and let Life go,\nAs a beast out in the night,\nTo lie, and be rid of pain?\nChorus.\nSome Women\nA.\n"O Zeus, O Earth, O Light:"\nThe cry of a bride forlorn\nHeard ye, and wailing born\nOf lost delight?\n[Pg 11]B.\nWhy weariest thou this day,\nWild heart, for the bed abhorrèd,\nThe cold bed in the clay?\nDeath cometh though no man pray,\nUngarlanded, un-adorèd.\nCall him not thou.\nC.\nIf another's arms be now\nWhere thine have been,\nOn his head be the sin:\nRend not thy brow!\nD.\nAll that thou sufferest,\nGod seeth: Oh, not so sore\nWaste nor weep for the breast\nThat was thine of yore.\nVoice (within).\nVirgin of Righteousness,\nVirgin of hallowed Troth,\nYe marked me when with an oath\nI bound him; mark no less\nThat oath's end. Give me to see\nHim and his bride, who sought\nMy grief when I wronged her not,\nBroken in misery,\n[Pg 12]            And all her house. . . . O God,\nMy mother's home, and the dim\nShore that I left for him,\nAnd the voice of my brother's blood. . . .\nNurse.\nOh, wild words! Did ye hear her cry\nTo them that guard man's faith forsworn,\nThemis and Zeus? . . . This wrath new-born\nShall make mad workings ere it die.\nChorus.\nOther Women.\nA.\nWould she but come to seek\nOur faces, that love her well,\nAnd take to her heart the spell\nOf words that speak?\nB.\nAlas for the heavy hate\nAnd anger that burneth ever!\nWould it but now abate,\nAh God, I love her yet.\nAnd surely my love's endeavour\nShall fail not here.\nC.\nGo: from that chamber drear\nForth to the day\nLead her, and say, Oh, say\nThat we love her dear.\n[Pg 13]D.\nGo, lest her hand be hard\nOn the innocent: Ah, let be!\nFor her grief moves hitherward,\nLike an angry sea.\nNurse.\nThat will I: though what words of mine\nOr love shall move her? Let them lie\nWith the old lost labours! . . . Yet her eye—\nKnow ye the eyes of the wild kine,\nThe lion flash that guards their brood?\nSo looks she now if any thrall\nSpeak comfort, or draw near at all\nMy mistress in her evil mood.\n[The Nurse goes into the house.\nChorus.\nA Woman.\nAlas, the bold blithe bards of old\nThat all for joy their music made,\nFor feasts and dancing manifold,\nThat Life might listen and be glad.\nBut all the darkness and the wrong,\nQuick deaths and dim heart-aching things,\nWould no man ease them with a song\nOr music of a thousand strings?\n[Pg 14]         Then song had served us in our need.\nWhat profit, o'er the banquet's swell\nThat lingering cry that none may heed?\nThe feast hath filled them: all is well!\nOthers.\nI heard a song, but it comes no more.\nWhere the tears ran over:\nA keen cry but tired, tired:\nA woman's cry for her heart's desired,\nFor a traitor's kiss and a lost lover.\nBut a prayer, methinks, yet riseth sore\nTo God, to Faith, God's ancient daughter—\nThe Faith that over sundering seas\nDrew her to Hellas, and the breeze\nOf midnight shivered, and the door\nClosed of the salt unsounded water.\n[During the last words Medea has come out from the house.\nMedea.\nWomen of Corinth, I am come to show\nMy face, lest ye despise me. For I know\nSome heads stand high and fail not, even at night\nAlone—far less like this, in all men's sight:\nAnd we, who study not our wayfarings\nBut feel and cry—Oh we are drifting things,\nAnd evil! For what truth is in men's eyes,\nWhich search no heart, but in a flash despise\n[Pg 15]A strange face, shuddering back from one that ne'er\nHath wronged them? . . . Sure, far-comers anywhere,\nI know, must bow them and be gentle. Nay,\nA Greek himself men praise not, who alway\nShould seek his own will recking not. . . . But I—\nThis thing undreamed of, sudden from on high,\nHath sapped my soul: I dazzle where I stand,\nThe cup of all life shattered in my hand,\nLonging to die—O friends! He, even he,\nWhom to know well was all the world to me,\nThe man I loved, hath proved most evil.—Oh,\nOf all things upon earth that bleed and grow,\nA herb most bruised is woman. We must pay\nOur store of gold, hoarded for that one day,\nTo buy us some man's love; and lo, they bring\nA master of our flesh! There comes the sting\nOf the whole shame. And then the jeopardy,\nFor good or ill, what shall that master be;\nReject she cannot: and if he but stays\nHis suit, 'tis shame on all that woman's days.\nSo thrown amid new laws, new places, why,\n'Tis magic she must have, or prophecy—\nHome never taught her that—how best to guide\nToward peace this thing that sleepeth at her side.\nAnd she who, labouring long, shall find some way\nWhereby her lord may bear with her, nor fray\nHis yoke too fiercely, blessed is the breath\nThat woman draws! Else, let her pray for death.\nHer lord, if he be wearied of the face\nWithindoors, gets him forth; some merrier place\nWill ease his heart: but she waits on, her whole\nVision enchainèd on a single soul.\n[Pg 16]And then, forsooth, 'tis they that face the call\nOf war, while we sit sheltered, hid from all\nPeril!—False mocking! Sooner would I stand\nThree times to face their battles, shield in hand,\nThan bear one child.\nBut peace! There cannot be\nEver the same tale told of thee and me.\nThou hast this city, and thy father's home,\nAnd joy of friends, and hope in days to come:\nBut I, being citiless, am cast aside\nBy him that wedded me, a savage bride\nWon in far seas and left—no mother near,\nNo brother, not one kinsman anywhere\nFor harbour in this storm. Therefore of thee\nI ask one thing. If chance yet ope to me\nSome path, if even now my hand can win\nStrength to requite this Jason for his sin,\nBetray me not! Oh, in all things but this,\nI know how full of fears a woman is,\nAnd faint at need, and shrinking from the light\nOf battle: but once spoil her of her right\nIn man's love, and there moves, I warn thee well,\nNo bloodier spirit between heaven and hell.\nLeader.\nI will betray thee not. It is but just,\nThou smite him.—And that weeping in the dust\nAnd stormy tears, how should I blame them? . . .\nStay:\n'Tis Creon, lord of Corinth, makes his way\nHither, and bears, methinks, some word of weight.\n[Pg 17]Enter from the right Creon, the King, with armed Attendants.\nCreon.\nThou woman sullen-eyed and hot with hate\nAgainst thy lord, Medea, I here command\nThat thou and thy two children from this land\nGo forth to banishment. Make no delay:\nSeeing ourselves, the King, are come this day\nTo see our charge fulfilled; nor shall again\nLook homeward ere we have led thy children twain\nAnd thee beyond our realm's last boundary.\nMedea.\nLost! Lost!\nMine haters at the helm with sail flung free\nPursuing; and for us no beach nor shore\nIn the endless waters! . . . Yet, though stricken sore,\nI still will ask thee, for what crime, what thing\nUnlawful, wilt thou cast me out, O King?\nCreon.\nWhat crime? I fear thee, woman—little need\nTo cloak my reasons—lest thou work some deed\nOf darkness on my child. And in that fear\nReasons enough have part. Thou comest here\nA wise-woman confessed, and full of lore\nIn unknown ways of evil. Thou art sore\nIn heart, being parted from thy lover's arms.\nAnd more, thou hast made menace . . . so the alarms\n[Pg 18]But now have reached mine ear . . . on bride and groom,\nAnd him who gave the bride, to work thy doom\nOf vengeance. Which, ere yet it be too late,\nI sweep aside. I choose to earn thine hate\nOf set will now, not palter with the mood\nOf mercy, and hereafter weep in blood.\nMedea.\n'Tis not the first nor second time, O King,\nThat fame hath hurt me, and come nigh to bring\nMy ruin. . . . How can any man, whose eyes\nAre wholesome, seek to rear his children wise\nBeyond men's wont? Much helplessness in arts\nOf common life, and in their townsmen's hearts\nEnvy deep-set . . . so much their learning brings!\nCome unto fools with knowledge of new things,\nThey deem it vanity, not knowledge. Aye,\nAnd men that erst for wisdom were held high,\nFeel thee a thorn to fret them, privily\nHeld higher than they. So hath it been with me.\nA wise-woman I am; and for that sin\nTo divers ill names men would pen me in;\nA seed of strife; an eastern dreamer; one\nOf brand not theirs; one hard to play upon . . .\nAh, I am not so wondrous wise!—And now,\nTo thee, I am terrible! What fearest thou?\nWhat dire deed? Do I tread so proud a path—\nFear me not thou!—that I should brave the wrath\nOf princes? Thou: what has thou ever done\nTo wrong me? Granted thine own child to one\nWhom thy soul chose.—Ah, him out of my heart\nI hate; but thou, meseems, hast done thy part\n[Pg 19]Not ill. And for thine houses' happiness\nI hold no grudge. Go: marry, and God bless\nYour issues. Only suffer me to rest\nSomewhere within this land. Though sore oppressed,\nI will be still, knowing mine own defeat.\nCreon.\nThy words be gentle: but I fear me yet\nLest even now there creep some wickedness\nDeep hid within thee. And for that the less\nI trust thee now than ere these words began.\nA woman quick of wrath, aye, or a man,\nIs easier watching than the cold and still.\nUp, straight, and find thy road! Mock not my will\nWith words. This doom is passed beyond recall;\nNor all thy crafts shall help thee, being withal\nMy manifest foe, to linger at my side.\nMedea (suddenly throwing herself down and clinging to Creon).\nOh, by thy knees! By that new-wedded bride . . .\nCreon.\n'Tis waste of words. Thou shalt not weaken me.\nMedea.\nWilt hunt me? Spurn me when I kneel to thee?\nCreon.\n'Tis mine own house that kneels to me, not thou.\n[Pg 20]Medea.\nHome, my lost home, how I desire thee now!\nCreon.\nAnd I mine, and my child, beyond all things.\nMedea.\nO Loves of man, what curse is on your wings!\nCreon.\nBlessing or curse, 'tis as their chances flow.\nMedea.\nRemember, Zeus, the cause of all this woe!\nCreon.\nOh, rid me of my pains! Up, get thee gone!\nMedea.\nWhat would I with thy pains? I have mine own.\nCreon.\nUp: or, 'fore God, my soldiers here shall fling . . .\nMedea.\nNot that! Not that! . . . I do but pray, O King . . .\n[Pg 21]Creon.\nThou wilt not? I must face the harsher task?\nMedea.\nI accept mine exile. 'Tis not that I ask.\nCreon.\nWhy then so wild? Why clinging to mine hand?\nMedea (rising).\nFor one day only leave me in thy land\nAt peace, to find some counsel, ere the strain\nOf exile fall, some comfort for these twain,\nMine innocents; since others take no thought,\nIt seems, to save the babes that they begot.\nAh! Thou wilt pity them! Thou also art\nA father: thou hast somewhere still a heart\nThat feels. . . . I reck not of myself: 'tis they\nThat break me, fallen upon so dire a day.\nCreon.\nMine is no tyrant's mood. Aye, many a time\nEre this my tenderness hath marred the chime\nOf wisest counsels. And I know that now\nI do mere folly. But so be it! Thou\nShalt have this grace . . . But this I warn thee clear,\nIf once the morrow's sunlight find thee here\nWithin my borders, thee or child of thine,\nThou diest! . . . Of this judgment not a line\n[Pg 22]Shall waver nor abate. So linger on,\nIf thou needs must, till the next risen sun;\nNo further. . . . In one day there scarce can be\nThose perils wrought whose dread yet haunteth me.\n[Exit Creon with his suite.\nChorus.\nO woman, woman of sorrow,\nWhere wilt thou turn and flee?\nWhat town shall be thine to-morrow,\nWhat land of all lands that be,\nWhat door of a strange man's home?\nYea, God hath hunted thee,\nMedea, forth to the foam\nOf a trackless sea.\nMedea.\nDefeat on every side; what else?—But Oh,\nNot here the end is: think it not! I know\nFor bride and groom one battle yet untried,\nAnd goodly pains for him that gave the bride.\nDost dream I would have grovelled to this man,\nSave that I won mine end, and shaped my plan\nFor merry deeds? My lips had never deigned\nSpeak word with him: my flesh been never stained\nWith touching. . . . Fool, Oh, triple fool! It lay\nSo plain for him to kill my whole essay\nBy exile swift: and, lo, he sets me free\nThis one long day: wherein mine haters three\nShall lie here dead, the father and the bride\nAnd husband—mine, not hers! Oh, I have tried\n[Pg 23]So many thoughts of murder to my turn,\nI know not which best likes me. Shall I burn\nTheir house with fire? Or stealing past unseen\nTo Jason's bed—I have a blade made keen\nFor that—stab, breast to breast, that wedded pair?\nGood, but for one thing. When I am taken there,\nAnd killed, they will laugh loud who hate me. . . .\nNay,\nI love the old way best, the simple way\nOf poison, where we too are strong as men.\nAh me!\nAnd they being dead—what place shall hold me then?\nWhat friend shall rise, with land inviolate\nAnd trusty doors, to shelter from their hate\nThis flesh? . . . None anywhere! . . . A little more\nI needs must wait: and, if there ope some door\nOf refuge, some strong tower to shield me, good:\nIn craft and darkness I will hunt this blood.\nElse, if mine hour be come and no hope nigh,\nThen sword in hand, full-willed and sure to die,\nI yet will live to slay them. I will wend\nMan-like, their road of daring to the end.\nSo help me She who of all Gods hath been\nThe best to me, of all my chosen queen\nAnd helpmate, Hecatê, who dwells apart,\nThe flame of flame, in my fire's inmost heart:\nFor all their strength, they shall not stab my soul\nAnd laugh thereafter! Dark and full of dole\nTheir bridal feast shall be, most dark the day\nThey joined their hands, and hunted me away.\nAwake thee now, Medea! Whatso plot\nThou hast, or cunning, strive and falter not.\n[Pg 24]On to the peril-point! Now comes the strain\nOf daring. Shall they trample thee again?\nHow? And with Hellas laughing o'er thy fall\nWhile this thief's daughter weds, and weds withal\nJason? . . . A true king was thy father, yea,\nAnd born of the ancient Sun! . . . Thou know'st the way;\nAnd God hath made thee woman, things most vain\nFor help, but wondrous in the paths of pain.\n[Medea goes into the House.\nChorus.\nBack streams the wave on the ever running river:\nLife, life is changed and the laws of it o'ertrod.\nMan shall be the slave, the affrighted, the low-liver!\nMan hath forgotten God.\nAnd woman, yea, woman, shall be terrible in story:\nThe tales too, meseemeth, shall be other than of yore.\nFor a fear there is that cometh out of Woman and a glory,\nAnd the hard hating voices shall encompass her no more!\nThe old bards shall cease, and their memory that lingers\nOf frail brides and faithless, shall be shrivelled as with fire.\nFor they loved us not, nor knew us: and our lips were dumb, our fingers\nCould wake not the secret of the lyre.\n[Pg 25]Else, else, O God the Singer, I had sung amid their rages\nA long tale of Man and his deeds for good and ill.\nBut the old World knoweth—'tis the speech of all his ages—\nMan's wrong and ours: he knoweth and is still.\nSome Women.\nForth from thy father's home\nThou camest, O heart of fire,\nTo the Dark Blue Rocks, to the clashing foam,\nTo the seas of thy desire:\nTill the Dark Blue Bar was crossed;\nAnd, lo, by an alien river\nStanding, thy lover lost,\nVoid-armed for ever,\nForth yet again, O lowest\nOf landless women, a ranger\nOf desolate ways, thou goest,\nFrom the walls of the stranger.\nOthers.\nAnd the great Oath waxeth weak;\nAnd Ruth, as a thing outstriven,\nIs fled, fled, from the shores of the Greek,\nAway on the winds of heaven.\n[Pg 26]           Dark is the house afar,\nWhere an old king called thee daughter;\nAll that was once thy star\nIn stormy water,\nDark: and, lo, in the nearer\nHouse that was sworn to love thee,\nAnother, queenlier, dearer,\nIs thronèd above thee.\nEnter from the right Jason.\nJason.\nOft have I seen, in other days than these,\nHow a dark temper maketh maladies\nNo friend can heal. 'Twas easy to have kept\nBoth land and home. It needed but to accept\nUnstrivingly the pleasure of our lords.\nBut thou, for mere delight in stormy words,\nWilt lose all! . . . Now thy speech provokes not me.\nRail on. Of all mankind let Jason be\nMost evil; none shall check thee. But for these\nDark threats cast out against the majesties\nOf Corinth, count as veriest gain thy path\nOf exile. I myself, when princely wrath\nWas hot against thee, strove with all good will\nTo appease the wrath, and wished to keep thee still\nBeside me. But thy mouth would never stay\nFrom vanity, blaspheming night and day\nOur masters. Therefore thou shalt fly the land.\nYet, even so, I will not hold my hand\nFrom succouring mine own people. Here am I\nTo help thee, woman, pondering heedfully\n[Pg 27]Thy new state. For I would not have thee flung\nProvisionless away—aye, and the young\nChildren as well; nor lacking aught that will\nOf mine can bring thee. Many a lesser ill\nHangs on the heels of exile. . . . Aye, and though\nThou hate me, dream not that my heart can know\nOr fashion aught of angry will to thee.\nMedea.\nEvil, most evil! . . . since thou grantest me\nThat comfort, the worst weapon left me now\nTo smite a coward. . . . Thou comest to me, thou,\nMine enemy! (Turning to the Chorus.) Oh, say, how call ye this,\nTo face, and smile, the comrade whom his kiss\nBetrayed? Scorn? Insult? Courage? None of these:\n'Tis but of all man's inward sicknesses\nThe vilest, that he knoweth not of shame\nNor pity! Yet I praise him that he came . . .\nTo me it shall bring comfort, once to clear\nMy heart on thee, and thou shalt wince to hear.\nI will begin with that, 'twixt me and thee,\nThat first befell. I saved thee. I saved thee—\nLet thine own Greeks be witness, every one\nThat sailed on Argo—saved thee, sent alone\nTo yoke with yokes the bulls of fiery breath,\nAnd sow that Acre of the Lords of Death;\nAnd mine own ancient Serpent, who did keep\nThe Golden Fleece, the eyes that knew not sleep,\nAnd shining coils, him also did I smite\nDead for thy sake, and lifted up the light\n[Pg 28]That bade thee live. Myself, uncounsellèd,\nStole forth from father and from home, and fled\nWhere dark Iôlcos under Pelion lies,\nWith thee—Oh, single-hearted more than wise!\nI murdered Pelias, yea, in agony,\nBy his own daughters' hands, for sake of thee;\nI swept their house like War.—And hast thou then\nAccepted all—O evil yet again!—\nAnd cast me off and taken thee for bride\nAnother? And with children at thy side!\nOne could forgive a childless man. But no:\nI have borne thee children . . .\nIs sworn faith so low\nAnd weak a thing? I understand it not.\nAre the old gods dead? Are the old laws forgot,\nAnd new laws made? Since not my passioning,\nBut thine own heart, doth cry thee for a thing\nForsworn.\n[She catches sight of her own hand which she has\nthrown out to denounce him.\nPoor, poor right hand of mine, whom he\nDid cling to, and these knees, so cravingly,\nWe are unclean, thou and I; we have caught the stain\nOf bad men's flesh . . . and dreamed our dreams in vain.\nThou comest to befriend me? Give me, then,\nThy counsel. 'Tis not that I dream again\nFor good from thee: but, questioned, thou wilt show\nThe viler. Say: now whither shall I go?\nBack to my father? Him I did betray,\nAnd all his land, when we two fled away.\nTo those poor Peliad maids? For them 'twere good\nTo take me in, who spilled their father's blood. . . .\n[Pg 29]Aye, so my whole life stands! There were at home\nWho loved me well: to them I am become\nA curse. And the first friends who sheltered me,\nWhom most I should have spared, to pleasure thee\nI have turned to foes. Oh, therefore hast thou laid\nMy crown upon me, blest of many a maid\nIn Hellas, now I have won what all did crave,\nThee, the world-wondered lover and the brave;\nWho this day looks and sees me banished, thrown\nAway with these two babes, all, all, alone . . .\nOh, merry mocking when the lamps are red:\n"Where go the bridegroom's babes to beg their bread\nIn exile, and the woman who gave all\nTo save him?"\nO great God, shall gold withal\nBear thy clear mark, to sift the base and fine,\nAnd o'er man's living visage runs no sign\nTo show the lie within, ere all too late?\nLeader.\nDire and beyond all healing is the hate\nWhen hearts that loved are turned to enmity.\nJason.\nIn speech at least, meseemeth, I must be\nNot evil; but, as some old pilot goes\nFurled to his sail's last edge, when danger blows\nToo fiery, run before the wind and swell,\nWoman, of thy loud storms.—And thus I tell\nMy tale. Since thou wilt build so wondrous high\nThy deeds of service in my jeopardy,\n[Pg 30]To all my crew and quest I know but one\nSaviour, of Gods or mortals one alone,\nThe Cyprian. Oh, thou hast both brain and wit,\nYet underneath . . . nay, all the tale of it\nWere graceless telling; how sheer love, a fire\nOf poison-shafts, compelled thee with desire\nTo save me. But enough. I will not score\nThat count too close. 'Twas good help: and therefor\nI give thee thanks, howe'er the help was wrought.\nHowbeit, in my deliverance, thou hast got\nFar more than given. A good Greek land hath been\nThy lasting home, not barbary. Thou hast seen\nOur ordered life, and justice, and the long\nStill grasp of law not changing with the strong\nMan's pleasure. Then, all Hellas far and near\nHath learned thy wisdom, and in every ear\nThy fame is. Had thy days run by unseen\nOn that last edge of the world, where then had been\nThe story of great Medea? Thou and I . . .\nWhat worth to us were treasures heapèd high\nIn rich kings' rooms; what worth a voice of gold\nMore sweet than ever rang from Orpheus old,\nUnless our deeds have glory?\nSpeak I so,\nTouching the Quest I wrought, thyself did throw\nThe challenge down. Next for thy cavilling\nOf wrath at mine alliance with a king,\nHere thou shalt see I both was wise, and free\nFrom touch of passion, and a friend to thee\nMost potent, and my children . . . Nay, be still!\nWhen first I stood in Corinth, clogged with ill\n[Pg 31]From many a desperate mischance, what bliss\nCould I that day have dreamed of, like to this,\nTo wed with a king's daughter, I exiled\nAnd beggared? Not—what makes thy passion wild—\nFrom loathing of thy bed; not over-fraught\nWith love for this new bride; not that I sought\nTo upbuild mine house with offspring: 'tis enough,\nWhat thou hast borne: I make no word thereof:\nBut, first and greatest, that we all might dwell\nIn a fair house and want not, knowing well\nThat poor men have no friends, but far and near\nShunning and silence. Next, I sought to rear\nOur sons in nurture worthy of my race,\nAnd, raising brethren to them, in one place\nJoin both my houses, and be all from now\nPrince-like and happy. What more need hast thou\nOf children? And for me, it serves my star\nTo link in strength the children that now are\nWith those that shall be.\nHave I counselled ill?\nNot thine own self would say it, couldst thou still\nOne hour thy jealous flesh.—'Tis ever so!\nWho looks for more in women? When the flow\nOf love runs plain, why, all the world is fair:\nBut, once there fall some ill chance anywhere\nTo baulk that thirst, down in swift hate are trod\nMen's dearest aims and noblest. Would to God\nWe mortals by some other seed could raise\nOur fruits, and no blind women block our ways!\nThen had there been no curse to wreck mankind.\n[Pg 32]Leader.\nLord Jason, very subtly hast thou twined\nThy speech: but yet, though all athwart thy will\nI speak, this is not well thou dost, but ill,\nBetraying her who loved thee and was true.\nMedea.\nSurely I have my thoughts, and not a few\nHave held me strange. To me it seemeth, when\nA crafty tongue is given to evil men\n'Tis like to wreck, not help them. Their own brain\nTempts them with lies to dare and dare again,\nTill . . . no man hath enough of subtlety.\nAs thou—be not so seeming-fair to me\nNor deft of speech. One word will make thee fall.\nWert thou not false, 'twas thine to tell me all,\nAnd charge me help thy marriage path, as I\nDid love thee; not befool me with a lie.\nJason.\nAn easy task had that been! Aye, and thou\nA loving aid, who canst not, even now,\nStill that loud heart that surges like the tide!\nMedea.\nThat moved thee not. Thine old barbarian bride,\nThe dog out of the east who loved thee sore,\nShe grew grey-haired, she served thy pride no more.\n[Pg 33]Jason.\nNow understand for once! The girl to me\nIs nothing, in this web of sovranty\nI hold. I do but seek to save, even yet,\nThee: and for brethren to our sons beget\nYoung kings, to prosper all our lives again.\nMedea.\nGod shelter me from prosperous days of pain,\nAnd wealth that maketh wounds about my heart.\nJason.\nWilt change that prayer, and choose a wiser part?\nPray not to hold true sense for pain, nor rate\nThyself unhappy, being too fortunate.\nMedea.\nAye, mock me; thou hast where to lay thine head,\nBut I go naked to mine exile.\nJason.\nTread\nThine own path! Thou hast made it all to be.\nMedea.\nHow? By seducing and forsaking thee?\n[Pg 34]Jason.\nBy those vile curses on the royal halls\nLet loose. . . .\nMedea.\nOn thy house also, as chance falls,\nI am a living curse.\nJason.\nOh, peace! Enough\nOf these vain wars: I will no more thereof.\nIf thou wilt take from all that I possess\nAid for these babes and thine own helplessness\nOf exile, speak thy bidding. Here I stand\nFull-willed to succour thee with stintless hand,\nAnd send my signet to old friends that dwell\nOn foreign shores, who will entreat thee well.\nRefuse, and thou shalt do a deed most vain.\nBut cast thy rage away, and thou shalt gain\nMuch, and lose little for thine anger's sake.\nMedea.\nI will not seek thy friends. I will not take\nThy givings. Give them not. Fruits of a stem\nUnholy bring no blessing after them.\nJason.\nNow God in heaven be witness, all my heart\nIs willing, in all ways, to do its part\n[Pg 35]For thee and for thy babes. But nothing good\nCan please thee. In sheer savageness of mood\nThou drivest from thee every friend. Wherefore\nI warrant thee, thy pains shall be the more.\n[He goes slowly away.\nMedea.\nGo: thou art weary for the new delight\nThou wooest, so long tarrying out of sight\nOf her sweet chamber. Go, fulfil thy pride,\nO bridegroom! For it may be, such a bride\nShall wait thee,—yea, God heareth me in this—\nAs thine own heart shall sicken ere it kiss.\nChorus.\nAlas, the Love that falleth like a flood,\nStrong-winged and transitory:\nWhy praise ye him? What beareth he of good\nTo man, or glory?\nYet Love there is that moves in gentleness,\nHeart-filling, sweetest of all powers that bless.\nLoose not on me, O Holder of man's heart,\nThy golden quiver,\nNor steep in poison of desire the dart\nThat heals not ever.\nThe pent hate of the word that cavilleth,\nThe strife that hath no fill,\nWhere once was fondness; and the mad heart's breath\nFor strange love panting still:\nO Cyprian, cast me not on these; but sift,\nKeen-eyed, of love the good and evil gift.\n[Pg 36]       Make Innocence my friend, God's fairest star,\nYea, and abate not\nThe rare sweet beat of bosoms without war,\nThat love, and hate not.\nOthers.\nHome of my heart, land of my own,\nCast me not, nay, for pity,\nOut on my ways, helpless, alone,\nWhere the feet fail in the mire and stone,\nA woman without a city.\nAh, not that! Better the end:\nThe green grave cover me rather,\nIf a break must come in the days I know,\nAnd the skies be changed and the earth below;\nFor the weariest road that man may wend\nIs forth from the home of his father.\nLo, we have seen: 'tis not a song\nSung, nor learned of another.\nFor whom hast thou in thy direst wrong\nFor comfort? Never a city strong\nTo hide thee, never a brother.\nAh, but the man—cursèd be he,\nCursèd beyond recover,\nWho openeth, shattering, seal by seal,\nA friend's clean heart, then turns his heel,\nDeaf unto love: never in me\nFriend shall he know nor lover.\n[While Medea is waiting downcast, seated upon her door-step, there passes from the left a traveller with followers. As he catches sight of Medea he stops.\n[Pg 37]Aegeus.\nHave joy, Medea! 'Tis the homeliest\nWord that old friends can greet with, and the best.\nMedea (looking up, surprised).\nOh, joy on thee, too, Aegeus, gentle king\nOf Athens!—But whence com'st thou journeying?\nAegeus.\nFrom Delphi now and the old encaverned stair. . . .\nMedea.\nWhere Earth's heart speaks in song?

Oh, so may thy desire\nOf children be fulfilled of God, and thou\nDie happy! . . . Thou canst know not; even now\nThy prize is won! I, I will make of thee\nA childless man no more. The seed shall be,\nI swear it, sown.

But in this land,\nWhere Creon rules, I may not raise my hand\nTo shelter thee. Move of thine own essay\nTo seek my house, there thou shalt alway stay,\nInviolate, never to be seized again.\nBut come thyself from Corinth. I would fain\nEven in foreign eyes be alway just.\n[Pg 43]Medea.\n'Tis well. Give me an oath wherein to trust\nAnd all that man could ask thou hast granted me.\nAegeus.\nDost trust me not? Or what thing troubleth thee?\nMedea.\nI trust thee. But so many, far and near,\nDo hate me—all King Pelias' house, and here\nCreon. Once bound by oaths and sanctities\nThou canst not yield me up for such as these\nTo drag from Athens. But a spoken word,\nNo more, to bind thee, which no God hath heard. . .\nThe embassies, methinks, would come and go:\nThey all are friends to thee. . . . Ah me, I know\nThou wilt not list to me!

Comes he here,\nThen with soft reasons will I feed his ear,\nHow his will now is my will, how all things\nAre well, touching this marriage-bed of kings\nFor which I am betrayed—all wise and rare\nAnd profitable! Yet will I make one prayer,\nThat my two children be no more exiled\nBut stay. . . . Oh, not that I would leave a child\n[Pg 46]Here upon angry shores till those have laughed\nWho hate me: 'tis that I will slay by craft\nThe king's daughter. With gifts they shall be sent,\nGifts to the bride to spare their banishment,\nFine robings and a carcanet of gold.\nWhich raiment let her once but take, and fold\nAbout her, a foul death that girl shall die\nAnd all who touch her in her agony.\nSuch poison shall they drink, my robe and wreath!\nHowbeit, of that no more. I gnash my teeth\nThinking on what a path my feet must tread\nThereafter. I shall lay those children dead—\nMine, whom no hand shall steal from me away!\nThen, leaving Jason childless, and the day\nAs night above him, I will go my road\nTo exile, flying, flying from the blood\nOf these my best-beloved, and having wrought\nAll horror, so but one thing reach me not,\nThe laugh of them that hate us.\nLet it come!\nWhat profits life to me? I have no home,\nNo country now, nor shield from any wrong.\nThat was my evil hour, when down the long\nHalls of my father out I stole, my will\nChained by a Greek man's voice, who still, oh, still,\nIf God yet live, shall all requited be.\nFor never child of mine shall Jason see\nHereafter living, never child beget\nFrom his new bride, who this day, desolate\nEven as she made me desolate, shall die\nShrieking amid my poisons. . . .

Yea, I know to what bad things\nI go, but louder than all thought doth cry\nAnger, which maketh man's worst misery.\n[She follows the Children into the house.\nChorus.\nMy thoughts have roamed a cloudy land,\nAnd heard a fierier music fall\nThan woman's heart should stir withal:\nAnd yet some Muse majestical,\nUnknown, hath hold of woman's hand,\nSeeking for Wisdom—not in all:\n[Pg 62]          A feeble seed, a scattered band,\nThou yet shalt find in lonely places,\nNot dead amongst us, nor our faces\nTurned alway from the Muses' call.\nAnd thus my thought would speak: that she\nWho ne'er hath borne a child nor known\nIs nearer to felicity:\nUnlit she goeth and alone,\nWith little understanding what\nA child's touch means of joy or woe,\nAnd many toils she beareth not.\nBut they within whose garden fair\nThat gentle plant hath blown, they go\nDeep-written all their days with care—\nTo rear the children, to make fast\nTheir hold, to win them wealth; and then\nMuch darkness, if the seed at last\nBear fruit in good or evil men!\nAnd one thing at the end of all\nAbideth, that which all men dread:\nThe wealth is won, the limbs are bred\nTo manhood, and the heart withal\nHonest: and, lo, where Fortune smiled,\nSome change, and what hath fallen? Hark!\n'Tis death slow winging to the dark,\nAnd in his arms what was thy child.\nWhat therefore doth it bring of gain\nTo man, whose cup stood full before,\n[Pg 63]          That God should send this one thing more\nOf hunger and of dread, a door\nSet wide to every wind of pain?\n[Medea comes out alone from the house.\nMedea.\nFriends, this long hour I wait on Fortune's eyes,\nAnd strain my senses in a hot surmise\nWhat passeth on that hill.—Ha! even now\nThere comes . . .

Nor let behind thee stay\nOne chariot's wing, one keel that sweeps the seas. . . .\nMedea.\nAnd what hath chanced, to cause such flights as these?\nMessenger.\nThe maiden princess lieth—and her sire,\nThe king—both murdered by thy poison-fire.\nMedea.\nMost happy tiding! Which thy name prefers\nHenceforth among my friends and well-wishers.\n[Pg 64]Messenger.\nWhat say'st thou? Woman, is thy mind within\nClear, and not raving? Thou art found in sin\nMost bloody wrought against the king's high head,\nAnd laughest at the tale, and hast no dread?\nMedea.\nI have words also that could answer well\nThy word. But take thine ease, good friend, and tell,\nHow died they? Hath it been a very foul\nDeath, prithee? That were comfort to my soul.\nMessenger.\nWhen thy two children, hand in hand entwined,\nCame with their father, and passed on to find\nThe new-made bridal rooms, Oh, we were glad,\nWe thralls, who ever loved thee well, and had\nGrief in thy grief. And straight there passed a word\nFrom ear to ear, that thou and thy false lord\nHad poured peace offering upon wrath foregone.\nA right glad welcome gave we them, and one\nKissed the small hand, and one the shining hair:\nMyself, for very joy, I followed where\nThe women's rooms are. There our mistress . . . she\nWhom now we name so . . . thinking not to see\nThy little pair, with glad and eager brow\nSate waiting Jason. Then she saw, and slow\nShrouded her eyes, and backward turned again,\nSick that thy children should come near her. Then\n[Pg 65]Thy husband quick went forward, to entreat\nThe young maid's fitful wrath. "Thou will not meet\nLove's coming with unkindness? Nay, refrain\nThy suddenness, and turn thy face again,\nHolding as friends all that to me are dear,\nThine husband. And accept these robes they bear\nAs gifts: and beg thy father to unmake\nHis doom of exile on them—for my sake."\nWhen once she saw the raiment, she could still\nHer joy no more, but gave him all his will.\nAnd almost ere the father and the two\nChildren were gone from out the room, she drew\nThe flowerèd garments forth, and sate her down\nTo her arraying: bound the golden crown\nThrough her long curls, and in a mirror fair\nArranged their separate clusters, smiling there\nAt the dead self that faced her. Then aside\nShe pushed her seat, and paced those chambers wide\nAlone, her white foot poising delicately—\nSo passing joyful in those gifts was she!—\nAnd many a time would pause, straight-limbed, and wheel\nHer head to watch the long fold to her heel\nSweeping. And then came something strange. Her cheek\nSeemed pale, and back with crooked steps and weak\nGroping of arms she walked, and scarcely found\nHer old seat, that she fell not to the ground.\nAmong the handmaids was a woman old\nAnd grey, who deemed, I think, that Pan had hold\n[Pg 66]Upon her, or some spirit, and raised a keen\nAwakening shout; till through her lips was seen\nA white foam crawling, and her eyeballs back\nTwisted, and all her face dead pale for lack\nOf life: and while that old dame called, the cry\nTurned strangely to its opposite, to die\nSobbing. Oh, swiftly then one woman flew\nTo seek her father's rooms, one for the new\nBridegroom, to tell the tale. And all the place\nWas loud with hurrying feet.\nSo long a space\nAs a swift walker on a measured way\nWould pace a furlong's course in, there she lay\nSpeechless, with veilèd lids. Then wide her eyes\nShe oped, and wildly, as she strove to rise,\nShrieked: for two diverse waves upon her rolled\nOf stabbing death. The carcanet of gold\nThat gripped her brow was molten in a dire\nAnd wondrous river of devouring fire.\nAnd those fine robes, the gift thy children gave—\nGod's mercy!—everywhere did lap and lave\nThe delicate flesh; till up she sprang, and fled,\nA fiery pillar, shaking locks and head\nThis way and that, seeking to cast the crown\nSomewhere away. But like a thing nailed down\nThe burning gold held fast the anadem,\nAnd through her locks, the more she scattered them,\nCame fire the fiercer, till to earth she fell\nA thing—save to her sire—scarce nameable,\nAnd strove no more. That cheek of royal mien,\nWhere was it—or the place where eyes had been?\n[Pg 67]Only from crown and temples came faint blood\nShot through with fire. The very flesh, it stood\nOut from the bones, as from a wounded pine\nThe gum starts, where those gnawing poisons fine\nBit in the dark—a ghastly sight! And touch\nThe dead we durst not. We had seen too much.\nBut that poor father, knowing not, had sped,\nSwift to his daughter's room, and there the dead\nLay at his feet. He knelt, and groaning low,\nFolded her in his arms, and kissed her: "Oh,\nUnhappy child, what thing unnatural hath\nSo hideously undone thee? Or what wrath\nOf gods, to make this old grey sepulchre\nChildless of thee? Would God but lay me there\nTo die with thee, my daughter!" So he cried.\nBut after, when he stayed from tears, and tried\nTo uplift his old bent frame, lo, in the folds\nOf those fine robes it held, as ivy holds\nStrangling among your laurel boughs. Oh, then\nA ghastly struggle came! Again, again,\nUp on his knee he writhed; but that dead breast\nClung still to his: till, wild, like one possessed,\nHe dragged himself half free; and, lo, the live\nFlesh parted; and he laid him down to strive\nNo more with death, but perish; for the deep\nHad risen above his soul. And there they sleep,\nAt last, the old proud father and the bride,\nEven as his tears had craved it, side by side.\nFor thee—Oh, no word more! Thyself will know\nHow best to baffle vengeance. . . . Long ago\nI looked upon man's days, and found a grey\nShadow. And this thing more I surely say,\n[Pg 68]That those of all men who are counted wise,\nStrong wits, devisers of great policies,\nDo pay the bitterest toll. Since life began,\nHath there in God's eye stood one happy man?\nFair days roll on, and bear more gifts or less\nOf fortune, but to no man happiness.\n[Exit Messenger.\nChorus.\nSome Women.\nWrath upon wrath, meseems, this day shall fall\nFrom God on Jason!

Why batter ye\nWith brazen bars, seeking the dead and me\nWho slew them? Peace! . . . And thou, if aught of mine\nThou needest, speak, though never touch of thine\n[Pg 74]Shall scathe me more. Out of his firmament\nMy fathers' father, the high Sun, hath sent\nThis, that shall save me from mine enemies' rage.\nJason.\nThou living hate! Thou wife in every age\nAbhorrèd, blood-red mother, who didst kill\nMy sons, and make me as the dead: and still\nCanst take the sunshine to thine eyes, and smell\nThe green earth, reeking from thy deed of hell;\nI curse thee! Now, Oh, now mine eyes can see,\nThat then were blinded, when from savagery\nOf eastern chambers, from a cruel land,\nTo Greece and home I gathered in mine hand\nThee, thou incarnate curse: one that betrayed\nHer home, her father, her . . . Oh, God hath laid\nThy sins on me!—I knew, I knew, there lay\nA brother murdered on thy hearth that day\nWhen thy first footstep fell on Argo's hull. . . .\nArgo, my own, my swift and beautiful\nThat was her first beginning. Then a wife\nI made her in my house. She bore to life\nChildren: and now for love, for chambering\nAnd men's arms, she hath murdered them! A thing\nNot one of all the maids of Greece, not one,\nHad dreamed of; whom I spurned, and for mine own\nChose thee, a bride of hate to me and death,\nTigress, not woman, beast of wilder breath\n[Pg 75]Than Skylla shrieking o'er the Tuscan sea.\nEnough! No scorn of mine can reach to thee,\nSuch iron is o'er thine eyes. Out from my road,\nThou crime-begetter, blind with children's blood!\nAnd let me weep alone the bitter tide\nThat sweepeth Jason's days, no gentle bride\nTo speak with more, no child to look upon\nWhom once I reared . . . all, all for ever gone!\nMedea.\nAn easy answer had I to this swell\nOf speech, but Zeus our father knoweth well,\nAll I for thee have wrought, and thou for me.\nSo let it rest. This thing was not to be,\nThat thou shouldst live a merry life, my bed\nForgotten and my heart uncomforted,\nThou nor thy princess: nor the king that planned\nThy marriage drive Medea from his land,\nAnd suffer not. Call me what thing thou please,\nTigress or Skylla from the Tuscan seas:\nMy claws have gripped thine heart, and all things shine.\nJason.\nThou too hast grief. Thy pain is fierce as mine.\nMedea.\nI love the pain, so thou shalt laugh no more.\nJason.\nOh, what a womb of sin my children bore!\n[Pg 76]Medea.\nSons, did ye perish for your father's shame?\nJason.\nHow? It was not my hand that murdered them.\nMedea.\n'Twas thy false wooings, 'twas thy trampling pride.\nJason.\nThou hast said it! For thy lust of love they died.\nMedea.\nAnd love to women a slight thing should be?\nJason.\nTo women pure!—All thy vile life to thee!\nMedea.\nThink of thy torment. They are dead, they are dead!\nJason.\nNo: quick, great God; quick curses round thy head!\nMedea.\nThe Gods know who began this work of woe.\n[Pg 77]Jason.\nThy heart and all its loathliness they know.\nMedea.\nLoathe on. . . . But, Oh, thy voice. It hurts me sore.\nJason.\nAye, and thine me. Wouldst hear me then no more?\nMedea.\nHow? Show me but the way. 'Tis this I crave.\nJason.\nGive me the dead to weep, and make their grave.\nMedea.\nNever! Myself will lay them in a still\nGreen sepulchre, where Hera by the Hill\nHath precinct holy, that no angry men\nMay break their graves and cast them forth again\nTo evil. So I lay on all this shore\nOf Corinth a high feast for evermore\nAnd rite, to purge them yearly of the stain\nOf this poor blood. And I, to Pallas' plain\nI go, to dwell beside Pandion's son,\nAegeus.—For thee, behold, death draweth on,\nEvil and lonely, like thine heart: the hands\nOf thine old Argo, rotting where she stands,\n[Pg 78]Shall smite thine head in twain, and bitter be\nTo the last end thy memories of me.\n[She rises on the chariot and is slowly borne away.\nJason.\nMay They that hear the weeping child\nBlast thee, and They that walk in blood!\nMedea.\nThy broken vows, thy friends beguiled\nHave shut for thee the ears of God.\nJason.\nGo, thou art wet with children's tears!\nMedea.\nGo thou, and lay thy bride to sleep.\nJason.\nChildless, I go, to weep and weep.\nMedea.\nNot yet! Age cometh and long years.\nJason.\nMy sons, mine own!\nMedea.\nNot thine, but mine . . .\nJason.\n. . . Who slew them!\nMedea.\nYes: to torture thee.\nJason.\nOnce let me kiss their lips, once twine\nMine arms and touch. . . . Ah, woe is me!\n[Pg 79]Medea.\nWouldst love them and entreat? But now\nThey were as nothing.\nJason.\nAt the last,\nO God, to touch that tender brow!\nMedea.\nThy words upon the wind are cast.\nJason.\nThou, Zeus, wilt hear me. All is said\nFor naught. I am but spurned away\nAnd trampled by this tigress, red\nWith children's blood. Yet, come what may,\nSo far as thou hast granted, yea,\nSo far as yet my strength may stand,\nI weep upon these dead, and say\nTheir last farewell, and raise my hand\nTo all the daemons of the air\nIn witness of these things; how she\nWho slew them, will not suffer me\nTo gather up my babes, nor bear\nTo earth their bodies; whom, O stone\nOf women, would I ne'er had known\nNor gotten, to be slain by thee!\n[He casts himself upon the earth.\n[Pg 80]Chorus.\nGreat treasure halls hath Zeus in heaven,\nFrom whence to man strange dooms be given,\nPast hope or fear.\nAnd the end men looked for cometh not,\nAnd a path is there where no man thought:\nSo hath it fallen here.",
