    "content":"AGAMEMNON\nCHARACTERS IN THE PLAY\nAGAMEMNON, son of Atreus and King of Argos and Mycenae; Commander-in-Chief of the Greek armies in the War against Troy.\nCLYTEMNESTRA, daughter of Tyndareus, sister of Helen; wife to Agamemnon.\nAIGISTHOS, son of Thyestes, cousin and blood-enemy to Agamemnon, lover to Clytemnestra.\nCASSANDRA, daughter of Priam, King of Troy, a prophetess; now slave to Agamemnon.\nA WATCHMAN.\nA HERALD.\nCHORUS of Argive Elders, faithful to AGAMEMNON.\nCHARACTERS MENTIONED IN THE PLAY\nMENELÂÜS, brother to Agamemnon, husband of Helen, and King of Sparta.\nThe two sons of Atreus are called the Atreidae.\nHELEN, most beautiful of women; daughter of Tyndareus, wife to MENELÂÜS; beloved and carried off by Paris.\nPARIS, son of Priam, King of Troy, lover of Helen.\nAlso called ALEXANDER.\nPRIAM, the aged King of Troy.\nThe Greeks are also referred to as Achaians, Argives, Danaans; Troy is also called Ilion.\nThe play was produced in the archonship of Philocles (458 B.C.). The first prize was won by Aeschylus with the “Agamemnon”, “Libation-Bearers”, “Eumenides”, and the Satyr Play “Proteus”.\nTHE AGAMEMNON\nThe Scene represents a space in front of the Palace of Agamemnon in Argos, with an Altar of Zeus in the centre and many other altars at the sides. On a high terrace of the roof stands a WATCHMAN. It is night.\nWATCHMAN.\nThis waste of year-long vigil I have prayed\nGod for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,\nAs sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae’s hall,\nTill well I know yon midnight festival\nOf swarming stars, and them that lonely go,\nBearers to man of summer and of snow,\nGreat lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.\nAnd still I await the sign, the beacon pyre\nThat bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame\nShouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim\nCleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passioned!\nAnd when I turn me to my bed—my bed\nDew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near\nCometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear\nBreathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain\nTo close may close too well to wake again;\nThink I perchance to sing or troll a tune\nFor medicine against sleep, the music soon\nChanges to sighing for the tale untold\nOf this house, not well mastered as of old.\nHowbeit, may God yet send us rest, and light\nThe flame of good news flashed across the night.\n[He is silent, watching. Suddenly at a distance in the night there is a glimmer of fire, increasing presently to a blaze.]\nHa!\nO kindler of the dark, O daylight birth\nOf dawn and dancing upon Argive earth\nFor this great end! All hail!—What ho, within!\nWhat ho! Bear word to Agamemnon’s queen\nTo rise, like dawn, and lift in answer strong\nTo this glad lamp her women’s triumph-song,\nIf verily, verily, Ilion’s citadel\nIs fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.\nAnd I myself will tread the dance before\nAll others; for my master’s dice I score\nGood, and mine own to-night three sixes plain.\n[Lights begin to show in the Palace.]\nOh, good or ill, my hand shall clasp again\nMy dear lord’s hand, returning! Beyond that\nI speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight\nAcross my tongue. But these stone walls know well,\nIf stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell.\nFor me, to him that knoweth I can yet\nSpeak; if another questions I forget.\n[Exit into the Palace. The women’s “Ololûgê” or triumph-cry, is heard within and then repeated again and again further off in the City. Handmaids and Attendants come from the Palace, bearing torches, with which they kindle incense on the altars. Among them comes CLYTEMNESTRA, who throws herself on her knees at the central Altar in an agony of prayer.]\n[Presently from the further side of the open space appear the CHORUS of ELDERS and move gradually into position in front of the Palace. The day begins to dawn.]\nCHORUS.\nTen years since Ilion’s righteous foes,\nThe Atreidae strong,\nMenelaüs and eke Agamemnon arose,\nTwo thrones, two sceptres, yoked of God;\nAnd a thousand galleys of Argos trod\nThe seas for the righting of wrong;\nAnd wrath of battle about them cried,\nAs vultures cry,\nWhose nest is plundered, and up they fly\nIn anguish lonely, eddying wide,\nGreat wings like oars in the waste of sky,\nTheir task gone from them, no more to keep\nWatch o’er the vulture babes asleep.\nBut One there is who heareth on high\nSome Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo—\nThat keen bird-throated suffering cry\nOf the stranger wronged in God’s own sky;\nAnd sendeth down, for the law transgressed,\nThe Wrath of the Feet that follow.\nSo Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend,\nZeus who Prevaileth, in after quest\nFor One Belovèd by Many Men\nOn Paris sent the Atreidae twain;\nYea, sent him dances before the end\nFor his bridal cheer,\nWrestlings heavy and limbs forespent\nFor Greek and Trojan, the knee earth-bent,\nThe bloody dust and the broken spear.\nHe knoweth, that which is here is here,\nAnd that which Shall Be followeth near;\nHe seeketh God with a great desire,\nHe heaps his gifts, he essays his pyre\nWith torch below and with oil above,\nWith tears, but never the wrath shall move\nOf the Altar cold that rejects his fire.\nWe saw the Avengers go that day,\nAnd they left us here; for our flesh is old\nAnd serveth not; and these staves uphold\nA strength like the strength of a child at play.\nFor the sap that springs in the young man’s hand\nAnd the valour of age, they have left the land.\nAnd the passing old, while the dead leaf blows\nAnd the old staff gropeth his three-foot way,\nWeak as a babe and alone he goes,\nA dream left wandering in the day.\n[Coming near the Central Altar they see CLYTEMNESTRA, who is still rapt in prayer.]\nBut thou, O daughter of Tyndareus,\nQueen Clytemnestra, what need? What news?\nWhat tale or tiding hath stirred thy mood\nTo send forth word upon all our ways\nFor incensed worship? Of every god\nThat guards the city, the deep, the high,\nGods of the mart, gods of the sky,\nThe altars blaze.\nOne here, one there,\nTo the skyey night the firebrands flare,\nDrunk with the soft and guileless spell\nOf balm of kings from the inmost cell.\nTell, O Queen, and reject us not,\nAll that can or that may be told,\nAnd healer be to this aching thought,\nWhich one time hovereth, evil-cold,\nAnd then from the fires thou kindlest\nWill Hope be kindled, and hungry Care\nFall back for a little while, nor tear\nThe heart that beateth below my breast.\n[CLYTEMNESTRA rises silently, as though unconscious of their presence, and goes into the House. The CHORUS take position and begin their first Stasimon, or Standing-song,]\nCHORUS.\n(The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young.)\nIt is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way given,\nTo men more strong,\n(For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven\nA spell, a Strength of Song:)\nHow the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided\nAbove all Greeks that are,\nWith avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided\nBy the Bird of War.\n’Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,\nOne Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,\nBy the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;\nAnd they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,\nYea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew.\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future.)\nAnd the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke\nTwain-tempered, knew\nThose fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,\nReading the omen true.\n“At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,\nYea, and before the wall\nViolent division the fulness of land and town\nShall waste withal;\nIf only God’s eye gloom not against our gates,\nAnd the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail.\nFor Pity lives, and those wingèd Hounds she hates,\nWhich tore in the Trembler’s body the unborn beast.\nAnd Artemis abhorreth the eagles’ feast.”\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her back.)\n“Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover\nOf the dewy breath of the Lion’s child;\nThou the delight, through den and cover,\nOf the young life at the breast of the wild,\nYet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles’ Kill!\nBe the vision accepted, albeit horrible….\nBut I-ê, I-ê! Stay her, O Paian, stay!\nFor lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,\nLong wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,\nOn, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:\nThey kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;\nStrife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,\nAnd beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken—\nIt plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth—\nWrath for a child to be.”\nSo Calchas, reading the wayside eagles’ sign,\nSpake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;\nAnd like his song be thine,\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace. I turn to Zeus, who has shown man how to Learn by Suffering.)\nZeus! Zeus, whate’er He be,\nIf this name He love to hear\nThis He shall be called of me.\nSearching earth and sea and air\nRefuge nowhere can I find\nSave Him only, if my mind\nWill cast off before it die\nThe burden of this vanity.\nOne there was who reigned of old,\nBig with wrath to brave and blast,\nLo, his name is no more told!\nAnd who followed met at last\nHis Third-thrower, and is gone.\nOnly they whose hearts have known\nZeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,\nThey shall win their vision’s end;\nZeus the Guide, who made man turn\nThought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain\nMan by Suffering shall Learn.\nSo the heart of him, again\nAching with remembered pain,\nBleeds and sleepeth not, until\nWisdom comes against his will.\n’Tis the gift of One by strife\nLifted to the throne of life.\n(AGAMEMNON accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the fleet lay at Aulis.)\nSo that day the Elder Lord,\nMarshal of the Achaian ships,\nStrove not with the prophet’s word,\nBowed him to his fate’s eclipse,\nWhen with empty jars and lips\nParched and seas impassable\nFate on that Greek army fell,\nFronting Chalcis as it lay,\nBy Aulis in the swirling bay.\n(Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the death of AGAMEMNON’S daughter. The King’s doubt and grief.)\nAnd winds, winds blew from Strymon River,\nUnharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,\nMan-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,\nAnd the waste of days was made long, more long,\nTill the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;\nThen through the storm rose the War-seer’s song,\nAnd told of medicine that should tame the tempest,\nBut bow the Princes to a direr wrong.\nThen “Artemis” he whispered, he named the name;\nAnd the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,\nAnd smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.\nBut the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:\n“A heavy doom, sure, if God’s will were broken;\nBut to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,\nIs that not heavy? That her blood should flow\nOn her father’s hand, hard beside an altar?\nMy path is sorrow wheresoe’er I go.\nShall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,\nAnd the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow?\nThey cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,\nFor a Virgin’s blood: ’tis a rite of old, men tell.\nAnd they burn with longing.—O God may the end be well!”\n(But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice.)\nTo the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,\nAnd a strange wind within his bosom tossed,\nA wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;\nAnd he rose up, daring to the uttermost.\nFor men are boldened by a Blindness, straying\nToward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,\nYea, and itself is grief;\nSo this man hardened to his own child’s slaying,\nAs help to avenge him for a woman’s laughter\nAnd bring his ships relief!\nHer “Father, Father,” her sad cry that lingered,\nHer virgin heart’s breath they held all as naught,\nThose bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;\nAnd there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought\nHe charged the young men to uplift and bind her,\nAs ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,\nFierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore\nTo the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder\nThe sweet mouth’s utterance, the cries that falter,\n—His curse for evermore!—\nWith violence and a curb’s voiceless wrath.\nHer stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,\nAnd her eye with an arrow of pity found its path\nTo each man’s heart that slew:\nA face in a picture, striving amazedly;\nThe little maid who danced at her father’s board,\nThe innocent voice man’s love came never nigh,\nWho joined to his her little paean-cry\nWhen the third cup was poured….\nWhat came thereafter I saw not neither tell.\nBut the craft of Calchas failed not.—’Tis written, He\nWho Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well.\nAnd that which is to be,\nYe will know at last; why weep before the hour?\nFor come it shall, as out of darkness dawn.\nOnly may good from all this evil flower;\nSo prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower\nGuarding the land alone.\n[As they cease, CLYTEMNESTRA comes from the Palace with Attendants. She has finished her prayer and sacrifice, and is now wrought up to face the meeting with her husband. The Leader approaches her.]\nLEADER.\nBefore thy state, O Queen, I bow mine eyes.\n’Tis written, when the man’s throne empty lies,\nThe woman shall be honoured.—Hast thou heard\nSome tiding sure? Or is it Hope, hath stirred\nTo fire these altars? Dearly though we seek\nTo learn, ’tis thine to speak or not to speak.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nGlad-voiced, the old saw telleth, comes this morn,\nThe Star-child of a dancing midnight born,\nAnd beareth to thine ear a word of joy\nBeyond all hope: the Greek hath taken Troy.\nLEADER.\nHow?\nThy word flies past me, being incredible.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nIlion is ours. No riddling tale I tell.\nLEADER.\nSuch joy comes knocking at the gate of tears.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, ’tis a faithful heart that eye declares.\nLEADER.\nWhat warrant hast thou? Is there proof of this?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThere is; unless a God hath lied there is.\nLEADER.\nSome dream-shape came to thee in speaking guise?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWho deemeth me a dupe of drowsing eyes?\nLEADER.\nSome word within that hovereth without wings?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAm I a child to hearken to such things?\nLEADER.\nTroy fallen?—But how long? When fell she, say?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThe very night that mothered this new day.\nLEADER.\nAnd who of heralds with such fury came?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nA Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame.\nWhence starting, beacon after beacon burst\nIn flaming message hitherward. Ida first\nTold Hermes’ Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign\nWas caught by towering Athos, the divine,\nWith pines immense—yea, fishes of the night\nSwam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,\nWhich swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far\nMakistos’ watchmen marked a glimmering star;\nThey, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,\nSpring up to hurl the fiery message on,\nAnd a far light beyond the Eurîpus tells\nThat word hath reached Messapion’s sentinels.\nThey beaconed back, then onward with a high\nHeap of dead heather flaming to the sky.\nAnd onward still, not failing nor aswoon,\nAcross the Asôpus like a beaming moon\nThe great word leapt, and on Kithairon’s height\nUproused a new relay of racing light.\nHis watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid\nTheir welcome, burning higher than was bid.\nOut over Lake Gorgôpis then it floats,\nTo Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,\nCrying for “Fire, more Fire!” And fire was reared,\nStintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,\nThat waved in flame beyond the promontory\nRock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,\nKindling the night: then one short swoop to catch\nThe Spider’s Crag, our city’s tower of watch;\nWhence hither to the Atreidae’s roof it came,\nA light true-fathered of Idaean flame.\nTorch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold\nThe tale thereof in stations manifold,\nEach one by each made perfect ere it passed,\nAnd Victory in the first as in the last.\nThese be my proofs and tokens that my lord\nFrom Troy hath spoke to me a burning word.\nLEADER.\nWoman, speak on. Hereafter shall my prayer\nBe raised to God; now let me only hear,\nAgain and full, the marvel and the joy.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNow, even now, the Achaian holdeth Troy!\nMethinks there is a crying in her streets\nThat makes no concord. When sweet unguent meets\nWith vinegar in one phial, I warrant none\nShall lay those wranglers lovingly at one.\nSo conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,\nTwo sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear.\nHere women in the dust about their slain,\nHusbands or brethren, and by dead old men\nPale children who shall never more be free,\nFor all they loved on earth cry desolately.\nAnd hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark\nBattle and then long searching through the dark\nHath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast\nAt last on all the plenty Troy possessed,\nNo portion in that feast nor ordinance,\nBut each man clutching at the prize of chance.\nAye, there at last under good roofs they lie\nOf men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,\nNo watches more, no bitter moony dew….\nHow blessèd they will sleep the whole night through!\nOh, if these days they keep them free from sin\nToward Ilion’s conquered shrines and Them within\nWho watch unconquered, maybe not again\nThe smiter shall be smit, the taker ta’en.\nMay God but grant there fall not on that host\nThe greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust\nTo spoil inviolate things! But half the race\nIs run which windeth back to home and peace.\nYea, though of God they pass unchallengèd,\nMethinks the wound of all those desolate dead\nMight waken, groping for its will….\nYe hear\nA woman’s word, belike a woman’s fear.\nMay good but conquer in the last incline\nOf the balance! Of all prayers that prayer is mine.\nLEADER.\nO Woman, like a man faithful and wise\nThou speakest. I accept thy testimonies\nAnd turn to God with praising, for a gain\nIs won this day that pays for all our pain.\n[CLYTEMNESTRA returns to the Palace. The CHORUS take up their position for the Second Stasimon.]\nAN ELDER.\nO Zeus, All-ruler, and Night the Aid,\nGainer of glories, and hast thou thrown\nOver the towers of Ilion\nThy net close-laid,\nThat none so nimble and none so tall\nShall escape withal\nThe snare of the slaver that claspeth all?\nANOTHER.\nAnd Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend\nI also praise, who hath wrought this end.\nLong since on Paris his shaft he drew,\nAnd hath aimèd true,\nNot too soon falling nor yet too far,\nThe fire of the avenging star.\nCHORUS.\n(This is God’s judgement upon Troy. May it not be too fierce! Gold cannot save one who spurneth Justice.)\nThe stroke of Zeus hath found them! Clear this day\nThe tale, and plain to trace.\nHe judged, and Troy hath fallen.—And have men said\nThat God not deigns to mark man’s hardihead,\nTrampling to earth the grace\nOf holy and delicate things?—Sin lies that way.\nFor visibly Pride doth breed its own return\nOn prideful men, who, when their houses swell\nWith happy wealth, breathe ever wrath and blood.\nYet not too fierce let the due vengeance burn;\nOnly as deemeth well\nOne wise of mood.\nNever shall state nor gold\nShelter his heart from aching\nWhoso the Altar of Justice old\nSpurneth to Night unwaking.\n(The Sinner suffers in his longing till at last Temptation overcomes him; as longing for Helen overcame Paris.)\nThe tempting of misery forceth him, the dread\nChild of fore-scheming Woe!\nAnd help is vain; the fell desire within\nIs veilèd not, but shineth bright like Sin:\nAnd as false gold will show\nBlack where the touchstone trieth, so doth fade\nHis honour in God’s ordeal. Like a child,\nForgetting all, he hath chased his wingèd bird,\nAnd planted amid his people a sharp thorn.\nAnd no God hears his prayer, or, have they heard,\nThe man so base-beguiled\nThey cast to scorn.\nParis to Argos came;\nLove of a woman led him;\nSo God’s altar he brought to shame,\nRobbing the hand that fed him.\n(Helen’s flight; the visions seen by the King’s seers; the phantom of Helen and the King’s grief.)\nShe hath left among her people a noise of shield and sword,\nA tramp of men armed where the long ships are moored;\nShe hath ta’en in her goings Desolation as a dower;\nShe hath stept, stept quickly, through the great gated Tower,\nAnd the thing that could not be, it hath been!\nAnd the Seers they saw visions, and they spoke of strange ill:\n“A Palace, a Palace; and a great King thereof:\nA bed, a bed empty, that was once pressed in love:\nAnd thou, thou, what art thou? Let us be, thou so still,\nBeyond wrath, beyond beseeching, to the lips reft of thee!”\nFor she whom he desireth is beyond the deep sea,\nAnd a ghost in his castle shall be queen.\nImages in sweet guise\nCarven shall move him never,\nWhere is Love amid empty eyes?\nGone, gone for ever!\n(His dreams and his suffering; but the War that he made caused greater and wider suffering.)\nBut a shape that is a dream, ’mid the phantoms of the night,\nCometh near, full of tears, bringing vain vain delight:\nFor in vain when, desiring, he can feel the joy’s breath\n—Nevermore! Nevermore!—from his arms it vanisheth,\nOn wings down the pathways of sleep.\nIn the mid castle hall, on the hearthstone of the Kings,\nThese griefs there be, and griefs passing these,\nBut in each man’s dwelling of the host that sailed the seas,\nA sad woman waits; she has thoughts of many things,\nAnd patience in her heart lieth deep.\nKnoweth she them she sent,\nKnoweth she? Lo, returning,\nComes in stead of the man that went\nArmour and dust of burning.\n(The return of the funeral urns; the murmurs of the People.)\nAnd the gold-changer, Ares, who changeth quick for dead,\nWho poiseth his scale in the striving of the spears,\nBack from Troy sendeth dust, heavy dust, wet with tears,\nSendeth ashes with men’s names in his urns neatly spread.\nAnd they weep over the men, and they praise them one by one,\nHow this was a wise fighter, and this nobly-slain—\n“Fighting to win back another’s wife!”\nTill a murmur is begun,\nAnd there steals an angry pain\nAgainst Kings too forward in the strife.\nThere by Ilion’s gate\nMany a soldier sleepeth,\nYoung men beautiful; fast in hate\nTroy her conqueror keepeth.\n(For the Shedder of Blood is in great peril, and not unmarked by God. May I never be a Sacker of Cities!)\nBut the rumour of the People, it is heavy, it is chill;\nAnd tho’ no curse be spoken, like a curse doth it brood;\nAnd my heart waits some tiding which the dark holdeth still,\nFor of God not unmarked is the shedder of much blood.\nAnd who conquers beyond right … Lo, the life of man decays;\nThere be Watchers dim his light in the wasting of the years;\nHe falls, he is forgotten, and hope dies.\nThere is peril in the praise\nOver-praised that he hears;\nFor the thunder it is hurled from God’s eyes.\nGlory that breedeth strife,\nPride of the Sacker of Cities;\nYea, and the conquered captive’s life,\nSpare me, O God of Pities!\nDIVERS ELDERS.\n—The fire of good tidings it hath sped the city through,\nBut who knows if a god mocketh? Or who knows if all be true?\n’Twere the fashion of a child,\nOr a brain dream-beguiled,\nTo be kindled by the first\nTorch’s message as it burst,\nAnd thereafter, as it dies, to die too.\n—’Tis like a woman’s sceptre, to ordain\nWelcome to joy before the end is plain!\n—Too lightly opened are a woman’s ears;\nHer fence downtrod by many trespassers,\nAnd quickly crossed; but quickly lost\nThe burden of a woman’s hopes or fears.\n[Here a break occurs in the action, like the descent of the curtain in a modern theatre. A space of some days is assumed to have passed and we find the Elders again assembled.]\nLEADER.\nSoon surely shall we read the message right;\nWere fire and beacon-call and lamps of light\nTrue speakers, or but happy lights, that seem\nAnd are not, like sweet voices in a dream.\nI see a Herald yonder by the shore,\nShadowed with olive sprays. And from his sore\nRent raiment cries a witness from afar,\nDry Dust, born brother to the Mire of war,\nThat mute he comes not, neither through the smoke\nOf mountain forests shall his tale be spoke;\nBut either shouting for a joyful day,\nOr else…. But other thoughts I cast away.\nAs good hath dawned, may good shine on, we pray!\n—And whoso for this City prayeth aught\nElse, let him reap the harvest of his thought!\n[Enter the HERALD, running. His garments are torn and war-stained. He falls upon his knees and kisses the Earth, and salutes each Altar in turn.]\nHERALD.\nLand of my fathers! Argos! Am I here …\nHome, home at this tenth shining of the year,\nAnd all Hope’s anchors broken save this one!\nFor scarcely dared I dream, here in mine own\nArgos at last to fold me to my rest….\nBut now—All Hail, O Earth! O Sunlight blest!\nAnd Zeus Most High!\n[Checking himself as he sees the altar of Apollo.]\nAnd thou, O Pythian Lord;\nNo more on us be thy swift arrows poured!\nBeside Scamander well we learned how true\nThy hate is. Oh, as thou art Healer too,\nHeal us! As thou art Saviour of the Lost,\nSave also us, Apollo, being so tossed\nWith tempest! … All ye Daemons of the Pale!\nAnd Hermes! Hermes, mine own guardian, hail!\nHerald beloved, to whom all heralds bow….\nYe Blessèd Dead that sent us, receive now\nIn love your children whom the spear hath spared.\nO House of Kings, O roof-tree thrice-endeared,\nO solemn thrones! O gods that face the sun!\nNow, now, if ever in the days foregone,\nAfter these many years, with eyes that burn,\nGive hail and glory to your King’s return!\nFor Agamemnon cometh! A great light\nCometh to men and gods out of the night.\nGrand greeting give him—aye, it need be grand—\nWho, God’s avenging mattock in his hand,\nHath wrecked Troy’s towers and digged her soil beneath,\nTill her gods’ houses, they are things of death;\nHer altars waste, and blasted every seed\nWhence life might rise! So perfect is his deed,\nSo dire the yoke on Ilion he hath cast,\nThe first Atreides, King of Kings at last,\nAnd happy among men! To whom we give\nHonour most high above all things that live.\nFor Paris nor his guilty land can score\nThe deed they wrought above the pain they bore.\n“Spoiler and thief,” he heard God’s judgement pass;\nWhereby he lost his plunder, and like grass\nMowed down his father’s house and all his land;\nAnd Troy pays twofold for the sin she planned.\nLEADER.\nBe glad, thou Herald of the Greek from Troy!\nHERALD.\nSo glad, I am ready, if God will, to die!\nLEADER.\nDid love of this land work thee such distress?\nHERALD.\nThe tears stand in mine eyes for happiness.\nLEADER.\nSweet sorrow was it, then, that on you fell.\nHERALD.\nHow sweet? I cannot read thy parable.\nLEADER.\nTo pine again for them that loved you true.\nHERALD.\nDid ye then pine for us, as we for you?\nLEADER.\nThe whole land’s heart was dark, and groaned for thee.\nHERALD.\nDark? For what cause? Why should such darkness be?\nLEADER.\nSilence in wrong is our best medicine here.\nHERALD.\nYour kings were gone. What others need you fear?\nLEADER.\n’Tis past! Like thee now, I could gladly die.\nHERALD.\nEven so! ’Tis past, and all is victory.\nAnd, for our life in those long years, there were\nDoubtless some grievous days, and some were fair.\nWho but a god goes woundless all his way?….\nOh, could I tell the sick toil of the day,\nThe evil nights, scant decks ill-blanketed;\nThe rage and cursing when our daily bread\nCame not! And then on land ’twas worse than all.\nOur quarters close beneath the enemy’s wall;\nAnd rain—and from the ground the river dew—\nWet, always wet! Into our clothes it grew,\nPlague-like, and bred foul beasts in every hair.\nWould I could tell how ghastly midwinter\nStole down from Ida till the birds dropped dead!\nOr the still heat, when on his noonday bed\nThe breathless blue sea sank without a wave!….\nWhy think of it? They are past and in the grave,\nAll those long troubles. For I think the slain\nCare little if they sleep or rise again;\nAnd we, the living, wherefore should we ache\nWith counting all our lost ones, till we wake\nThe old malignant fortunes? If Good-bye\nComes from their side, Why, let them go, say I.\nSurely for us, who live, good doth prevail\nUnchallenged, with no wavering of the scale;\nWherefore we vaunt unto these shining skies,\nAs wide o’er sea and land our glory flies:\n“By men of Argolis who conquered Troy,\nThese spoils, a memory and an ancient joy,\nAre nailed in the gods’ houses throughout Greece.”\nWhich whoso readeth shall with praise increase\nOur land, our kings, and God’s grace manifold\nWhich made these marvels be.—My tale is told.\nLEADER.\nIndeed thou conquerest me. Men say, the light\nIn old men’s eyes yet serves to learn aright.\nBut Clytemnestra and the House should hear\nThese tidings first, though I their health may share.\n[During the last words CLYTEMNESTRA has entered from the Palace.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nLong since I lifted up my voice in joy,\nWhen the first messenger from flaming Troy\nSpake through the dark of sack and overthrow.\nAnd mockers chid me: “Because beacons show\nOn the hills, must Troy be fallen? Quickly born\nAre women’s hopes!” Aye, many did me scorn;\nYet gave I sacrifice; and by my word\nThrough all the city our woman’s cry was heard,\nLifted in blessing round the seats of God,\nAnd slumbrous incense o’er the altars glowed\nIn fragrance.\nAnd for thee, what need to tell\nThy further tale? My lord himself shall well\nInstruct me. Yet, to give my lord and king\nAll reverent greeting at his homecoming—\nWhat dearer dawn on woman’s eyes can flame\nThan this, which casteth wide her gate to acclaim\nThe husband whom God leadeth safe from war?—\nGo, bear my lord this prayer: That fast and far\nHe haste him to this town which loves his name;\nAnd in his castle may he find the same\nWife that he left, a watchdog of the hall,\nTrue to one voice and fierce to others all;\nA body and soul unchanged, no seal of his\nBroke in the waiting years.—No thought of ease\nNor joy from other men hath touched my soul,\nNor shall touch, until bronze be dyed like wool.\nA boast so faithful and so plain, I wot,\nSpoke by a royal Queen doth shame her not.\n[Exit CLYTEMNESTRA.]\nLEADER.\nLet thine ear mark her message. ’Tis of fair\nSeeming, and craves a clear interpreter….\nBut, Herald, I would ask thee; tell me true\nOf Menelaüs. Shall he come with you,\nOur land’s belovèd crown, untouched of ill?\nHERALD.\nI know not how to speak false words of weal\nFor friends to reap thereof a harvest true.\nLEADER.\nCanst speak of truth with comfort joined? Those two\nOnce parted, ’tis a gulf not lightly crossed.\nHERALD.\nYour king is vanished from the Achaian host,\nHe and his ship! Such comfort have I brought.\nLEADER.\nSailed he alone from Troy? Or was he caught\nBy storms in the midst of you, and swept away?\nHERALD.\nThou hast hit the truth; good marksman, as men say!\nAnd long to suffer is but brief to tell.\nLEADER.\nHow ran the sailors’ talk? Did there prevail\nOne rumour, showing him alive or dead?\nHERALD.\nNone knoweth, none hath tiding, save the head\nOf Helios, ward and watcher of the world.\nLEADER.\nThen tell us of the storm. How, when God hurled\nHis anger, did it rise? How did it die?\nHERALD.\nIt likes me not, a day of presage high\nWith dolorous tongue to stain. Those twain, I vow,\nStand best apart. When one with shuddering brow,\nFrom armies lost, back beareth to his home\nWord that the terror of her prayers is come;\nOne wound in her great heart, and many a fate\nFor many a home of men cast out to sate\nThe two-fold scourge that worketh Ares’ lust,\nSpear crossed with spear, dust wed with bloody dust;\nWho walketh laden with such weight of wrong,\nWhy, let him, if he will, uplift the song\nThat is Hell’s triumph. But to come as I\nAm now come, laden with deliverance high,\nHome to a land of peace and laughing eyes,\nAnd mar all with that fury of the skies\nWhich made our Greeks curse God—how should this be?\nTwo enemies most ancient, Fire and Sea,\nA sudden friendship swore, and proved their plight\nBy war on us poor sailors through that night\nOf misery, when the horror of the wave\nTowered over us, and winds from Strymon drave\nHull against hull, till good ships, by the horn\nOf the mad whirlwind gored and overborne,\nOne here, one there, ’mid rain and blinding spray,\nLike sheep by a devil herded, passed away.\nAnd when the blessèd Sun upraised his head,\nWe saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead,\nDead men, dead ships, and spars disasterful.\nHowbeit for us, our one unwounded hull\nOut of that wrath was stolen or begged free\nBy some good spirit—sure no man was he!—\nWho guided clear our helm; and on till now\nHath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow.\nNo surge to mar our mooring, and no floor\nOf rock to tear us when we made for shore.\nTill, fled from that sea-hell, with the clear sun\nAbove us and all trust in fortune gone,\nWe drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts\nOf that lost army, broken and scourged with knouts\nOf evil. And, methinks, if there is breath\nIn them, they talk of us as gone to death—\nHow else?—and so say we of them! For thee,\nSince Menelaüs thy first care must be,\nIf by some word of Zeus, who wills not yet\nTo leave the old house for ever desolate,\nSome ray of sunlight on a far-off sea\nLights him, yet green and living … we may see\nHis ship some day in the harbour!—’Twas the word\nOf truth ye asked me for, and truth ye have heard!\n[Exit HERALD. The CHORUS take position for the Third Stasimon.]\nCHORUS.\n(Surely there was mystic meaning in the name HELENA, meaning which was fulfilled when she fled to Troy.)\nWho was He who found for thee\nThat name, truthful utterly—\nWas it One beyond our vision\nMoving sure in pre-decision\nOf man’s doom his mystic lips?—\nCalling thee, the Battle-wed,\nThee, the Strife-encompassèd,\nHELEN? Yea, in fate’s derision,\nHell in cities, Hell in ships,\nHell in hearts of men they knew her,\nWhen the dim and delicate fold\nOf her curtains backward rolled,\nAnd to sea, to sea, she threw her\nIn the West Wind’s giant hold;\nAnd with spear and sword behind her\nCame the hunters in a flood,\nDown the oarblade’s viewless trail\nTracking, till in Simoïs’ vale\nThrough the leaves they crept to find her,\nA Wrath, a seed of blood.\n(The Trojans welcomed her with triumph and praised Alexander till at last their song changed and they saw another meaning in Alexander’s name also.)\nSo the Name to Ilion came\nOn God’s thought-fulfilling flame,\nShe a vengeance and a token\nOf the unfaith to bread broken,\nOf the hearth of God betrayed,\nAgainst them whose voices swelled\nGlorying in the prize they held\nAnd the Spoiler’s vaunt outspoken\nAnd the song his brethren made\n’Mid the bridal torches burning;\nTill, behold, the ancient City\nOf King Priam turned, and turning\nTook a new song for her learning,\nA song changed and full of pity,\nWith the cry of a lost nation;\nAnd she changed the bridegroom’s name:\nCalled him Paris Ghastly-wed;\nFor her sons were with the dead,\nAnd her life one lamentation,\n’Mid blood and burning flame.\n(Like a lion’s whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great beast of prey,)\nLo, once there was a herdsman reared\nIn his own house, so stories tell,\nA lion’s whelp, a milk-fed thing\nAnd soft in life’s first opening\nAmong the sucklings of the herd;\nThe happy children loved him well,\nAnd old men smiled, and oft, they say,\nIn men’s arms, like a babe, he lay,\nBright-eyed, and toward the hand that teased him\nEagerly fawning for food or play.\nThen on a day outflashed the sudden\nRage of the lion brood of yore;\nHe paid his debt to them that fed\nWith wrack of herds and carnage red,\nYea, wrought him a great feast unbidden,\nTill all the house-ways ran with gore;\nA sight the thralls fled weeping from,\nA great red slayer, beard a-foam,\nHigh-priest of some blood-cursèd altar\nGod had uplifted against that home.\n(So was it with Helen in Troy.)\nAnd how shall I call the thing that came\nAt the first hour to Ilion city?\nCall it a dream of peace untold,\nA secret joy in a mist of gold,\nA woman’s eye that was soft, like flame,\nA flower which ate a man’s heart with pity.\nBut she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending,\nAnd a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending,\nWhen to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o’er the deep,\nWith the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind,\nA death-bride, whom brides long shall weep.\n(Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God; not so; Good Fortune may be innocent, and then there is no vengeance.)\nA grey word liveth, from the morn\nOf old time among mortals spoken,\nThat man’s Wealth waxen full shall fall\nNot childless, but get sons withal;\nAnd ever of great bliss is born\nA tear unstanched and a heart broken.\nBut I hold my thought alone and by others unbeguiled;\n’Tis the deed that is unholy shall have issue, child on child,\nSin on sin, like his begetters; and they shall be as they were.\nBut the man who walketh straight, and the house thereof, tho’ Fate\nExalt him, the children shall be fair.\n(It is Sin, it is Pride and Ruthlessness, that beget children like themselves till Justice is fulfilled upon them.)\nBut Old Sin loves, when comes the hour again,\nTo bring forth New,\nWhich laugheth lusty amid the tears of men;\nYea, and Unruth, his comrade, wherewith none\nMay plead nor strive, which dareth on and on,\nKnowing not fear nor any holy thing;\nTwo fires of darkness in a house, born true,\nLike to their ancient spring.\nBut Justice shineth in a house low-wrought\nWith smoke-stained wall,\nAnd honoureth him who filleth his own lot;\nBut the unclean hand upon the golden stair\nWith eyes averse she flieth, seeking where\nThings innocent are; and, recking not the power\nOf wealth by man misgloried, guideth all\nTo her own destined hour.\n[Here amid a great procession enter AGAMEMNON on a Chariot. Behind him on another Chariot is CASSANDRA. The CHORUS approach and make obeisance. Some of AGAMEMNON’S men have on their shields a White Horse, some a Lion. Their arms are rich and partly barbaric.]\nLEADER.\nAll hail, O King! Hail, Atreus’ Son!\nSacker of Cities! Ilion’s bane!\nWith what high word shall I greet thee again,\nHow give thee worship, and neither outrun\nThe point of pleasure, nor stint too soon?\nFor many will cling. To fair seeming\nThe faster because they have sinned erewhile;\nAnd a man may sigh with never a sting\nOf grief in his heart, and a man may smile\nWith eyes unlit and a lip that strains.\nBut the wise Shepherd knoweth his sheep,\nAnd his eyes pierce deep\nThe faith like water that fawns and feigns.\nBut I hide nothing, O King. That day\nWhen in quest of Helen our battle array\nHurled forth, thy name upon my heart’s scroll\nWas deep in letters of discord writ;\nAnd the ship of thy soul,\nIll-helmed and blindly steered was it,\nPursuing ever, through men that die,\nOne wild heart that was fain to fly.\nBut on this new day,\nFrom the deep of my thought and in love, I say\n“Sweet is a grief well ended;”\nAnd in time’s flow Thou wilt learn and know\nThe true from the false,\nOf them that were left to guard the walls\nOf thine empty Hall unfriended.\n[During the above CLYTEMNESTRA has appeared on the Palace steps, with a train of Attendants, to receive her Husband.]\nAGAMEMNON.\nTo Argos and the gods of Argolis\nAll hail, who share with me the glory of this\nHome-coming and the vengeance I did wreak\nOn Priam’s City! Yea, though none should speak,\nThe great gods heard our cause, and in one mood\nUprising, in the urn of bitter blood,\nThat men should shriek and die and towers should burn,\nCast their great vote; while over Mercy’s urn\nHope waved her empty hands and nothing fell.\nEven now in smoke that City tells her tale;\nThe wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died\nThe reek of the old fatness of her pride\nFrom hot and writhing ashes rolls afar.\nFor which let thanks, wide as our glories are,\nBe uplifted; seeing the Beast of Argos hath\nRound Ilion’s towers piled high his fence of wrath\nAnd, for one woman ravished, wrecked by force\nA City. Lo, the leap of the wild Horse\nin darkness when the Pleiades were dead;\nA mailed multitude, a Lion unfed,\nWhich leapt the tower and lapt the blood of Kings!\nLo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings.\nBut for thy words: I marked them, and I mind\nTheir meaning, and my voice shall be behind\nThine. For not many men, the proverb saith,\nCan love a friend whom fortune prospereth\nUnenvying; and about the envious brain\nCold poison clings, and doubles all the pain\nLife brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,\nAnd feels another’s gladness like a curse.\nWell can I speak. I know the mirrored glass\nCalled friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass\nAnd feign them a King’s friends. I have known but one—\nOdysseus, him we trapped against his own\nWill!—who once harnessed bore his yoke right well …\nBe he alive or dead of whom I tell\nThe tale. And for the rest, touching our state\nAnd gods, we will assemble in debate\nA concourse of all Argos, taking sure\nCounsel, that what is well now may endure\nWell, and if aught needs healing medicine, still\nBy cutting and by fire, with all good will,\nI will essay to avert the after-wrack\nSuch sickness breeds.\nAye, Heaven hath led me back;\nAnd on this hearth where still my fire doth burn\nI will go pay to heaven my due return,\nWhich guides me here, which saved me far away.\nO Victory, now mine own, be mine alway!\n[CLYTEMNESTRA, at the head of her retinue, steps forward. She controls her suspense with difficulty but gradually gains courage as she proceeds.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nYe Elders, Council of the Argive name\nHere present, I will no more hold it shame\nTo lay my passion bare before men’s eyes.\nThere comes a time to a woman when fear dies\nFor ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,\nSave me, the weight of years intolerable\nI lived while this man lay at Ilion.\nThat any woman thus should sit alone\nIn a half-empty house, with no man near,\nMakes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear\nAlway some voice of wrath; now messengers\nOf evil; now not so; then others worse,\nCrying calamity against mine and me.\nOh, had he half the wounds that variously\nCame rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,\nAll holes from heel to crown! And if he met\nAs many deaths as I met tales thereon,\nIs he some monstrous thing, some Gêryon\nThree-souled, that will not die, till o’er his head,\nThree robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?\nAye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose\nOf death had got me; but they cut me loose.\nIt was those voices alway in mine ear.\nFor that, too, young Orestes is not here\nBeside me, as were meet, seeing he above\nAll else doth hold the surety of our love;\nLet not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:\nOur loving spear-friend took him, Strophius\nThe Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy\nTwo-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,\nAnd ours here, if the rebel multitude\nShould cast the Council down. It is men’s mood\nAlway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,\nAnd sure no guile was in him.\nBut for me,\nThe old stormy rivers of my grief are dead\nNow at the spring; not one tear left unshed.\nMine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly\nWeeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee\nFor ever answerless. And did I dream,\nA gnat’s thin whirr would start me, like a scream\nOf battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,\nCrowding, too many for the time I slept.\nFrom all which stress delivered and free-souled,\nI greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,\nO forestay sure that fails not in the squall,\nO strong-based pillar of a towering hall;\nO single son to a father age-ridden;\nO land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;\nSunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;\nSpring of quick water in a desert dead ….\nHow sweet to be set free from any chain!\nThese be my words to greet him home again.\nNo god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou\nHave suffered in time past enough! And now\nDismount, O head with love and glory crowned,\nFrom this high car; yet plant not on bare ground\nThy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy.\nHo, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,\nA floor of crimson broideries to spread\nFor the King’s path. Let all the ground be red\nWhere those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,\nHome light him to the hearth he looks not for!\nWhat followeth next, our sleepless care shall see\nOrdered as God’s good pleasure may decree.\n[The attendants spread tapestries of crimson and gold from the Chariot to the Door of the Palace. AGAMEMNON does not move.]\nAGAMEMNON.\nDaughter of Leda, watcher of my fold,\nIn sooth thy welcome, grave and amply told,\nFitteth mine absent years. Though it had been\nSeemlier, methinks, some other, not my Queen,\nHad spoke these honours. For the rest, I say,\nSeek not to make me soft in woman’s way;\nCry not thy praise to me wide-mouthed, nor fling\nThy body down, as to some barbarous king.\nNor yet with broidered hangings strew my path,\nTo awake the unseen ire. ’Tis God that hath\nSuch worship; and for mortal man to press\nRude feet upon this broidered loveliness …\nI vow there is danger in it. Let my road\nBe honoured, surely; but as man, not god.\nRugs for the feet and yonder broidered pall …\nThe names ring diverse!… Aye, and not to fall\nSuddenly blind is of all gifts the best\nGod giveth, for I reckon no man blest\nEre to the utmost goal his race be run.\nSo be it; and if, as this day I have done,\nI shall do always, then I fear no ill.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nTell me but this, nowise against thy will …\nAGAMEMNON.\nMy will, be sure, shall falter not nor fade.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWas this a vow in some great peril made?\nAGAMEMNON.\nEnough! I have spoke my purpose, fixed and plain.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWere Priam the conqueror … Think, would he refrain?\nAGAMEMNON.\nOh, stores of broideries would be trampled then!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nLord, care not for the cavillings of men!\nAGAMEMNON.\nThe murmur of a people hath strange weight.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWho feareth envy, feareth to be great.\nAGAMEMNON.\n’Tis graceless when a woman strives to lead.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWhen a great conqueror yields, ’tis grace indeed,\nAGAMEMNON.\nSo in this war thou must my conqueror be?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nYield! With good will to yield is victory!\nAGAMEMNON.\nWell, if I needs must … Be it as thou hast said!\nQuick! Loose me these bound slaves on which I tread,\nAnd while I walk yon wonders of the sea\nGod grant no eye of wrath be cast on me\nFrom far!\n[The Attendants untie his shoes.]\nFor even now it likes me not\nTo waste mine house, thus marring underfoot\nThe pride thereof, and wondrous broideries\nBought in far seas with silver. But of these\nEnough.—And mark, I charge thee, this princess\nOf Ilion; tend her with all gentleness.\nGod’s eye doth see, and loveth from afar,\nThe merciful conqueror. For no slave of war\nIs slave by his own will. She is the prize\nAnd chosen flower of Ilion’s treasuries,\nSet by the soldiers’ gift to follow me.\nNow therefore, seeing I am constrained by thee\nAnd do thy will, I walk in conqueror’s guise\nBeneath my Gate, trampling sea-crimson dyes.\n[As he dismounts and sets foot on the Tapestries CLYTEMNESTRA’S women utter again their Cry of Triumph. The people bow or kneel as he passes.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThere is the sea—its caverns who shall drain?—\nBreeding of many a purple-fish the stain\nSurpassing silver, ever fresh renewed,\nFor robes of kings. And we, by right indued,\nPossess our fill thereof. Thy house, O King,\nKnoweth no stint, nor lack of anything.\nWhat trampling of rich raiment, had the cry\nSo sounded in the domes of prophesy,\nWould I have vowed these years, as price to pay\nFor this dear life in peril far away!\nWhere the root is, the leafage cometh soon\nTo clothe an house, and spread its leafy boon\nAgainst the burning star; and, thou being come,\nThou, on the midmost hearthstone of thy home,\nOh, warmth in winter leapeth to thy sign.\nAnd when God’s summer melteth into wine\nThe green grape, on that house shall coolness fall\nWhere the true man, the master, walks his hall.\nZeus, Zeus! True Master, let my prayers be true!\nAnd, oh, forget not that thou art willed to do!\n[She follows AGAMEMNON into the Palace. The retinues of both King and Queen go in after them. CASSANDRA remains.]\nCHORUS.\nWhat is this that evermore, [Strophe 1.\nA cold terror at the door\nOf this bosom presage-haunted,\nPale as death hovereth?\nWhile a song unhired, unwanted,\nBy some inward prophet chanted,\nSpeaks the secret at its core;\nAnd to cast it from my blood\nLike a dream not understood\nNo sweet-spoken Courage now\nSitteth at my heart’s dear prow.\nYet I know that manifold\nDays, like sand, have waxen old\nSince the day those shoreward-thrown\nCables flapped and line on line\nStanding forth for Ilion\nThe long galleys took the brine\n[Antistrophe 1.\nAnd in harbour—mine own eye\nHath beheld—again they lie;\nYet that lyreless music hidden\nWhispers still words of ill,\n’Tis the Soul of me unbidden,\nLike some Fury sorrow-ridden,\nWeeping over things that die.\nNeither waketh in my sense\nEver Hope’s dear confidence;\nFor this flesh that groans within,\nAnd these bones that know of Sin,\nThis tossed heart upon the spate\nOf a whirpool that is Fate,\nSurely these lie not.

Why must I come with thee….\nTo die, only to die?\nLEADER.\nThou art borne on the breath of God, thou spirit wild,\nFor thine own weird to wail,\nLike to that wingèd voice, that heart so sore\nWhich, crying alway, hungereth to cry more,\n“Itylus, Itylus,” till it sing her child\nBack to the nightingale.\nCASSANDRA.\nOh, happy Singing Bird, so sweet, so clear!\nSoft wings for her God made,\nAnd an easy passing, without pain or tear …\nFor me ’twill be torn flesh and rending blade.\nSECOND ELDER.\nWhence is it sprung, whence wafted on God’s breath,\nThis anguish reasonless?\nThis throbbing of terror shaped to melody,\nMoaning of evil blent with music high?\nWho hath marked out for thee that mystic path\nThrough thy woe’s wilderness?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas for the kiss, the kiss of Paris, his people’s bane!\nAlas for Scamander Water, the water my fathers drank!\nLong, long ago, I played about thy bank,\nAnd was cherished and grew strong;\nNow by a River of Wailing, by shores of Pain,\nSoon shall I make my song.\nLEADER.\nHow sayst thou? All too clear,\nThis ill word thou hast laid upon thy mouth!\nA babe could read thee plain.\nIt stabs within me like a serpent’s tooth,\nThe bitter thrilling music of her pain:\nI marvel as I hear.\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas for the toil, the toil of a City, worn unto death!\nAlas for my father’s worship before the citadel,\nThe flocks that bled and the tumult of their breath!\nBut no help from them came\nTo save Troy Towers from falling as they fell!…\nAnd I on the earth shall writhe, my heart aflame.\nSECOND ELDER.\nDark upon dark, new ominous words of ill!\nSure there hath swept on thee some Evil Thing,\nCrushing, which makes thee bleed\nAnd in the torment of thy vision sing\nThese plaining death-fraught oracles … Yet still, still,\nTheir end I cannot read!\nCASSANDRA. [By an effort she regains mastery of herself, and speaks directly to the Leader.]\n’Fore God, mine oracle shall no more hide\nWith veils his visage, like a new-wed bride!\nA shining wind out of this dark shall blow,\nPiercing the dawn, growing as great waves grow,\nTo burst in the heart of sunrise … stronger far\nThan this poor pain of mine. I will not mar\nWith mists my wisdom.\nBe near me as I go,\nTracking the evil things of long ago,\nAnd bear me witness. For this roof, there clings\nMusic about it, like a choir which sings\nOne-voiced, but not well-sounding, for not good\nThe words are. Drunken, drunken, and with blood,\nTo make them dare the more, a revelling rout\nIs in the rooms, which no man shall cast out,\nOf sister Furies. And they weave to song,\nHaunting the House, its first blind deed of wrong,\nSpurning in turn that King’s bed desecrate,\nDefiled, which paid a brother’s sin with hate….\nHath it missed or struck, mine arrow? Am I a poor\nDreamer, that begs and babbles at the door?\nGive first thine oath in witness, that I know\nOf this great dome the sins wrought long ago.\nELDER.\nAnd how should oath of mine, though bravely sworn,\nAppease thee? Yet I marvel that one born\nFar over seas, of alien speech, should fall\nSo apt, as though she had lived here and seen all.\nCASSANDRA.\nThe Seer Apollo made me too to see.\nELDER (in a low voice).\nWas the God’s heart pierced with desire for thee?\nCASSANDRA.\nTime was, I held it shame hereof to speak.\nELDER.\nAh, shame is for the mighty, not the weak.\nCASSANDRA.\nWe wrestled, and his breath to me was sweet.\nELDER.\nYe came to the getting of children, as is meet?\nCASSANDRA.\nI swore to Loxias, and I swore a lie.\nELDER.\nAlready thine the gift of prophecy?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlready I showed my people all their path.\nELDER.\nAnd Loxias did not smite thee in his wrath?\nCASSANDRA.\nAfter that sin … no man believed me more.\nELDER.\nNay, then, to us thy wisdom seemeth sure.\nCASSANDRA.\nOh, oh! Agony, agony!\nAgain the awful pains of prophecy\nAre on me, maddening as they fall….\nYe see them there … beating against the wall?\nSo young … like shapes that gather in a dream …\nSlain by a hand they loved. Children they seem,\nMurdered … and in their hands they bear baked meat:\nI think it is themselves. Yea, flesh; I see it;\nAnd inward parts…. Oh, what a horrible load\nTo carry! And their father drank their blood.\nFrom these, I warn ye, vengeance broodeth still,\nA lion’s rage, which goes not forth to kill\nBut lurketh in his lair, watching the high\nHall of my war-gone master … Master? Aye;\nMine, mine! The yoke is nailed about my neck….\nOh, lord of ships and trampler on the wreck\nOf Ilion, knows he not this she-wolf’s tongue,\nWhich licks and fawns, and laughs with ear up-sprung,\nTo bite in the end like secret death?—And can\nThe woman? Slay a strong and armèd man? …\nWhat fangèd reptile like to her doth creep?\nSome serpent amphisbene, some Skylla, deep\nHoused in the rock, where sailors shriek and die,\nMother of Hell blood-raging, which doth cry\nOn her own flesh war, war without alloy …\nGod! And she shouted in his face her joy,\nLike men in battle when the foe doth break.\nAnd feigns thanksgiving for his safety’s sake!\nWhat if no man believe me? ’Tis all one.\nThe thing which must be shall be; aye, and soon\nThou too shalt sorrow for these things, and here\nStanding confess me all too true a seer.\nLEADER.\nThe Thyestean feast of children slain\nI understood, and tremble. Aye, my brain\nReels at these visions, beyond guesswork true.\nBut after, though I heard, I had lost the clue.\nCASSANDRA.\nMan, thou shalt look on Agamemnon dead.\nLEADER.\nPeace, Mouth of Evil! Be those words unsaid!\nCASSANDRA.\nNo god of peace hath watch upon that hour.\nLEADER.\nIf it must come. Forefend it, Heavenly Power!\nCASSANDRA.\nThey do not think of prayer; they think of death.\nLEADER.\nThey? Say, what man this foul deed compasseth?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas, thou art indeed fallen far astray!\nLEADER.\nHow could such deed be done? I see no way.\nCASSANDRA.\nYet know I not the Greek tongue all too well?\nLEADER.\nGreek are the Delphic dooms, but hard to spell.\nCASSANDRA.\nAh! Ah! There!\nWhat a strange fire! It moves … It comes at me.\nO Wolf Apollo, mercy! O agony! …\nWhy lies she with a wolf, this lioness lone,\nTwo-handed, when the royal lion is gone?\nGod, she will kill me! Like to them that brew\nPoison, I see her mingle for me too\nA separate vial in her wrath, and swear,\nWhetting her blade for him, that I must share\nHis death … because, because he hath dragged me here!\nOh, why these mockers at my throat? This gear\nOf wreathèd bands, this staff of prophecy?\nI mean to kill you first, before I die.\nBegone!\n[She tears off her prophetic habiliments; and presently throws them on the ground, and stamps on them.]\nDown to perdition! … Lie ye so?\nSo I requite you! Now make rich in woe\nSome other Bird of Evil, me no more!\n[Coming to herself.]\nAh, see! It is Apollo’s self, hath tore\nHis crown from me! Who watched me long ago\nIn this same prophet’s robe, by friend, by foe,\nAll with one voice, all blinded, mocked to scorn:\n“A thing of dreams,” “a beggar-maid outworn,”\nPoor, starving and reviled, I endured all;\nAnd now the Seer, who called me till my call\nWas perfect, leads me to this last dismay….\n’Tis not the altar-stone where men did slay\nMy father; ’tis a block, a block with gore\nYet hot, that waits me, of one slain before.\nYet not of God unheeded shall we lie.\nThere cometh after, one who lifteth high\nThe downfallen; a branch where blossometh\nA sire’s avenging and a mother’s death.\nExiled and wandering, from this land outcast,\nOne day He shall return, and set the last\nCrown on these sins that have his house downtrod.\nFor, lo, there is a great oath sworn of God,\nHis father’s upturned face shall guide him home.\nWhy should I grieve? Why pity these men’s doom?\nI who have seen the City of Ilion\nPass as she passed; and they who cast her down\nHave thus their end, as God gives judgement sure….\nI go to drink my cup. I will endure\nTo die. O Gates, Death-Gates, all hail to you!\nOnly, pray God the blow be stricken true!\nPray God, unagonized, with blood that flows\nQuick unto friendly death, these eyes may close!\nLEADER.\nO full of sorrows, full of wisdom great,\nWoman, thy speech is a long anguish; yet,\nKnowing thy doom, why walkst thou with clear eyes,\nLike some god-blinded beast, to sacrifice?\nCASSANDRA.\nThere is no escape, friends; only vain delay.\nLEADER.\nIs not the later still the sweeter day?\nCASSANDRA.\nThe day is come. Small profit now to fly.\nLEADER.\nThrough all thy griefs, Woman, thy heart is high.\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas! None that is happy hears that praise.\nLEADER.\nAre not the brave dead blest in after days?\nCASSANDRA.\nO Father! O my brethren brave, I come!\n[She moves towards the House, but recoils shuddering.]\nLEADER.\nWhat frights thee? What is that thou startest from?\nCASSANDRA.\nAh, faugh! Faugh!\nLEADER.\nWhat turns thee in that blind\nHorror? Unless some loathing of the mind …\nCASSANDRA.\nDeath drifting from the doors, and blood like rain!\nLEADER.\n’Tis but the dumb beasts at the altar slain.\nCASSANDRA.\nAnd vapours from a charnel-house … See there!\nLEADER.\n’Tis Tyrian incense clouding in the air.\nCASSANDRA (recovering herself again).\nSo be it!—I will go, in yonder room\nTo weep mine own and Agamemnon’s doom.\nMay death be all! Strangers, I am no bird\nThat pipeth trembling at a thicket stirred\nBy the empty wind. Bear witness on that day\nWhen woman for this woman’s life shall pay,\nAnd man for man ill-mated low shall lie:\nI ask this boon, as being about to die.\nLEADER.\nAlas, I pity thee thy mystic fate!\nCASSANDRA.\nOne word, one dirge-song would I utter yet\nO’er mine own corpse. To this last shining Sun\nI pray that, when the Avenger’s work is done,\nHis enemies may remember this thing too,\nThis little thing, the woman slave they slew!\nO world of men, farewell! A painted show\nIs all thy glory; and when life is low\nThe touch of a wet sponge out-blotteth all.\nOh, sadder this than any proud man’s fall!\n[She goes into the House.]\nCHORUS.\nGreat Fortune is an hungry thing,\nAnd filleth no heart anywhere,\nThough men with fingers menacing\nPoint at the great house, none will dare,\nWhen Fortune knocks, to bar the door\nProclaiming: “Come thou here no more!”\nLo, to this man the Gods have given\nGreat Ilion in the dust to tread\nAnd home return, emblazed of heaven;\nIf it is writ, he too shall go\nThrough blood for blood spilt long ago;\nIf he too, dying for the dead,\nShould crown the deaths of alien years,\nWhat mortal afar off, who hears,\nShall boast him Fortune’s Child, and led\nAbove the eternal tide of tears?\n[A sudden Cry from within.]\nVOICE.\nHo! Treason in the house! I am wounded: slain.\nLEADER.\nHush! In the castle! ’Twas a cry\nOf some man wounded mortally.\nVOICE.\nAh God, another! I am stricken again.\nLEADER.\nI think the deed is done. It was the King\nWho groaned…. Stand close, and think if anything….\n[The Old Men gather together under the shock, and debate confusedly.]\nELDER B.\nI give you straight my judgement. Summon all\nThe citizens to rescue. Sound a call!\nELDER C.\nNo, no! Burst in at once without a word!\nIn, and convict them by their dripping sword!\nELDER D.\nYes; that or something like it. Quick, I say,\nBe doing! ’Tis a time for no delay.\nELDER E.\nWe have time to think. This opening … They have planned\nSome scheme to make enslavement of the land.\nELDER F.\nYes, while we linger here! They take no thought\nOf lingering, and their sword-arm sleepeth not!\nELDER G.\nI have no counsel. I can speak not. Oh,\nLet him give counsel who can strike a blow!\nELDER H.\nI say as this man says. I have no trust\nIn words to raise a dead man from the dust.\nELDER I.\nHow mean you? Drag out our poor lives, and stand\nCowering to these defilers of the land?\nELDER J.\nNay, ’tis too much! Better to strive and die!\nDeath is an easier doom than slavery.\nELDER K.\nWe heard a sound of groaning, nothing plain,\nHow know we—are we seers?—that one is slain?\nELDER L.\nOh, let us find the truth out, ere we grow\nThus passionate! To surmise is not to know.\nLEADER.\nBreak in, then! ’Tis the counsel ye all bring,\nAnd learn for sure, how is it with the King.\n[They cluster up towards the Palace Door, as though to force an entrance, when the great Door swings open, revealing CLYTEMNESTRA, who stands, axe in hand, over the dead bodies of AGAMEMNON and CASSANDRA. The body of AGAMEMNON is wrapped in a rich crimson web. There is blood on CLYTEMNESTRA’S brow, and she speaks in wild triumph.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nOh, lies enough and more have I this day\nSpoken, which now I shame not to unsay.\nHow should a woman work, to the utter end,\nHate on a damnèd hater, feigned a friend;\nHow pile perdition round him, hunter-wise,\nToo high for overleaping, save by lies?\nTo me this hour was dreamed of long ago;\nA thing of ancient hate. ’Twas very slow\nIn coming, but it came. And here I stand\nEven where I struck, with all the deed I planned\nDone! ’Twas so wrought—what boots it to deny?—\nThe man could neither guard himself nor fly.\nAn endless web, as by some fisher strung,\nA deadly plenteousness of robe, I flung\nAll round him, and struck twice; and with two cries\nHis limbs turned water and broke; and as he lies\nI cast my third stroke in, a prayer well-sped\nTo Zeus of Hell, who guardeth safe his dead!\nSo there he gasped his life out as he lay;\nAnd, gasping, the blood spouted … Like dark spray\nThat splashed, it came, a salt and deathly dew;\nSweet, sweet as God’s dear rain-drops ever blew\nO’er a parched field, the day the buds are born! …\nWhich things being so, ye Councillors high-born,\nDepart in joy, if joy ye will. For me,\nI glory. Oh, if such a thing might be\nAs o’er the dead thank-offering to outpour,\nOn this dead it were just, aye, just and more,\nWho filled the cup of the House with treacheries\nCurse-fraught, and here hath drunk it to the lees!\nLEADER.\nWe are astonied at thy speech. To fling,\nWild mouth! such vaunt over thy murdered King!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWouldst fright me, like a witless woman? Lo,\nThis bosom shakes not. And, though well ye know,\nI tell you … Curse me as ye will, or bless,\n’Tis all one … This is Agamemnon; this,\nMy husband, dead by my right hand, a blow\nStruck by a righteous craftsman. Aye, ’tis so.\nCHORUS.\nWoman, what evil tree,\nWhat poison grown of the ground\nOr draught of the drifting sea\nWay to thy lips hath found,\nMaking thee clothe thy heart\nIn rage, yea, in curses burning\nWhen thine own people pray?\nThou hast hewn, thou hast cast away;\nAnd a thing cast away thou art,\nA thing of hate and a spurning!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, now, for me, thou hast thy words of fate;\nExile from Argos and the people’s hate\nFor ever! Against him no word was cried,\nWhen, recking not, as ’twere a beast that died,\nWith flocks abounding o’er his wide domain,\nHe slew his child, my love, my flower of pain, …\nGreat God, as magic for the winds of Thrace!\nWhy was not he man-hunted from his place,\nTo purge the blood that stained him? … When the deed\nIs mine, oh, then thou art a judge indeed!\nBut threat thy fill. I am ready, and I stand\nContent; if thy hand beateth down my hand,\nThou rulest. If aught else be God’s decree,\nThy lesson shall be learned, though late it be.\nCHORUS.\nThy thought, it is very proud;\nThy breath is the scorner’s breath;\nIs not the madness loud\nIn thy heart, being drunk with death?\nYea, and above thy brow\nA star of the wet blood burneth!\nOh, doom shall have yet her day,\nThe last friend cast away,\nWhen lie doth answer lie\nAnd a stab for a stab returneth!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd heark what Oath-gods gather to my side!\nBy my dead child’s Revenge, now satisfied,\nBy Mortal Blindness, by all Powers of Hell\nWhich Hate, to whom in sacrifice he fell,\nMy Hope shall walk not in the house of Fear,\nWhile on my hearth one fire yet burneth clear,\nOne lover, one Aigisthos, as of old!\nWhat should I fear, when fallen here I hold\nThis foe, this scorner of his wife, this toy\nAnd fool of each Chryseis under Troy;\nAnd there withal his soothsayer and slave,\nHis chanting bed-fellow, his leman brave,\nWho rubbed the galleys’ benches at his side.\nBut, oh, they had their guerdon as they died!\nFor he lies thus, and she, the wild swan’s way,\nHath trod her last long weeping roundelay,\nAnd lies, his lover, ravisht o’er the main\nFor his bed’s comfort and my deep disdain.\nCHORUS. (Some Elders.)\nWould God that suddenly\nWith no great agony,\nNo long sick-watch to keep,\nMy hour would come to me,\nMy hour, and presently\nBring the eternal, the\nUnwaking Sleep,\nNow that my Shepherd, he\nWhose love watched over me,\nLies in the deep!\nANOTHER.\nFor woman’s sake he endured and battled well,\nAnd by a woman’s hand he fell.\nOTHERS.\nWhat hast thou done, O Helen blind of brain,\nO face that slew the souls on Ilion’s plain,\nOne face, one face, and many a thousand slain?\nThe hate of old that on this castle lay,\nBuilded in lust, a husband’s evil day,\nHath bloomed for thee a perfect flower again\nAnd unforgotten, an old and burning stain\nNever to pass away.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNay, pray not for the hour of death, being tried\nToo sore beneath these blows\nNeither on Helen turn thy wrath aside,\nThe Slayer of Men, the face which hath destroyed\nIts thousand Danaan souls, and wrought a wide\nWound that no leech can close.\nCHORUS.\n—Daemon, whose heel is set\nOn the House and the twofold kin\nOf the high Tantalidae,\nA power, heavy as fate,\nThou wieldest through woman’s sin,\nPiercing the heart of me!\n—Like a raven swoln with hate\nHe hath set on the dead his claw,\nHe croaketh a song to sate\nHis fury, and calls it Law!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAh, call upon Him! Yea, call—\nAnd thy thought hath found its path—\nThe Daemon who haunts this hall,\nThe thrice-engorged Wrath;\nFrom him is the ache of the flesh\nFor blood born and increased;\nEre the old sore hath ceased\nIt oozeth afresh.\nCHORUS.\n—Indeed He is very great,\nAnd heavy his anger, He,\nThe Daemon who guides the fate\nOf the old Tantalidae:\nAlas, alas, an evil tale ye tell\nOf desolate angers and insatiable!\n—Ah me,\nAnd yet ’tis all as Zeus hath willed,\nDoer of all and Cause of all;\nBy His Word every chance doth fall,\nNo end without Him is fulfilled;\nWhat of these things\nBut cometh by high Heaven’s counsellings?\n[A band of Mourners has gathered within the House.]\nMOURNERS.\nAh, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!\nHow shall I weep, what word shall I say?\nCaught in the web of this spider thing,\nIn foul death gasping thy life away!\nWoe’s me, woe’s me, for this slavish lying,\nThe doom of craft and the lonely dying,\nThe iron two-edged and the hands that slay!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd criest thou still this deed hath been\nMy work?

It cannot be,\nYet from the deeps of ancient sin\nThe Avenger may have wrought with thee.\n—On the red Slayer crasheth, groping wild\nFor blood, more blood, to build his peace again,\nAnd wash like water the old frozen stain\nOf the torn child.\nMOURNERS.\nAh, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!\nHow shall I weep, what word shall I say?\nCaught in the web of this spider thing,\nIn foul death gasping thy life away.\nWoe’s me, woe’s me, for this slavish lying,\nThe doom of craft and the lonely dying,\nThe iron two-edged and the hands that slay!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd what of the doom of craft that first\nHe planted, making the House accurst?\nWhat of the blossom, from this root riven,\nIphigenîa, the unforgiven?\nEven as the wrong was, so is the pain:\nHe shall not laugh in the House of the slain,\nWhen the count is scored;\nHe hath but spoilèd and paid again\nThe due of the sword.\nCHORUS.\nI am lost; my mind dull-eyed\nKnows not nor feels\nWhither to fly nor hide\nWhile the House reels.\nThe noise of rain that falls\nOn the roof affrighteth me,\nWashing away the walls;\nRain that falls bloodily.\nDoth ever the sound abate?\nLo, the next Hour of Fate\nWhetting her vengeance due\nOn new whet-stones, for new\nWorkings of hate.\nMOURNERS.\nWould thou hadst covered me, Earth, O Earth,\nOr e’er I had looked on my lord thus low,\nIn the pallèd marble of silvern girth!\nWhat hands may shroud him, what tears may flow?\nNot thine, O Woman who dared to slay him,\nThou durst not weep to him now, nor pray him,\nNor pay to his soul the deep unworth\nOf gift or prayer to forget thy blow.\n—Oh, who with heart sincere\nShall bring praise or grief\nTo lay on the sepulchre\nOf the great chief?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nHis burial is not thine to array.\nBy me he fell, by me he died,\nI watch him to the grave, not cried\nBy mourners of his housefolk; nay,\nHis own child for a day like this\nWaits, as is seemly, and shall run\nBy the white waves of Acheron\nTo fold him in her arms and kiss!\nCHORUS.\nLo, she who was erst reviled\nRevileth; and who shall say?\nSpoil taken from them that spoiled,\nLife-blood from them that slay!\nSurely while God ensueth\nHis laws, while Time doth run\n’Tis written: On him that doeth\nIt shall be done.\nThis is God’s law and grace,\nWho then shall hunt the race\nOf curses from out this hall?\nThe House is sealed withal\nTo dreadfulness.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, thou hast found the Law, and stept\nIn Truth’s way.—Yet even now I call\nThe Living Wrath which haunts this hall\nTo truce and compact. I accept\nAll the affliction he doth heap\nUpon me, and I charge him go\nFar off with his self-murdering woe\nTo strange men’s houses. I will keep\nSome little dower, and leave behind\nAll else, contented utterly.\nI have swept the madness from the sky\nWherein these brethren slew their kind.\n[As she ceases, exhausted and with the fire gone out of her, AIGISTHOS, with Attendants, bursts triumphantly in.]\nAIGISTHOS.\nO shining day, O dawn of righteousness\nFulfilled! Now, now indeed will I confess\nThat divine watchers o’er man’s death and birth\nLook down on all the anguish of the earth,\nNow that I see him lying, as I love\nTo see him, in this net the Furies wove,\nTo atone the old craft of his father’s hand.\nFor Atreus, this man’s father, in this land\nReigning, and by Thyestes in his throne\nChallenged—he was his brother and mine own\nFather From home and city cast him out;\nAnd he, after long exile, turned about\nAnd threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won\nPromise of so much mercy, that his own\nLife-blood should reek not in his father’s hall.\nThen did that godless brother, Atreus, call,\nTo greet my sire—More eagerness, O God,\nWas there than love!—a feast of brotherhood.\nAnd, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat\nBefore him his dead children. The white feet\nAnd finger-fringèd hands apart he set,\nVeiled from all seeing, and made separate\nThe tables. And he straightway, knowing naught,\nTook of those bodies, eating that which wrought\nNo health for all his race. And when he knew\nThe unnatural deed, back from the board he threw,\nSpewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake\nThe table, to make strong the curse he spake:\n“Thus perish all of Pleisthenês begot!”\nFor that lies this man here; and all the plot\nIs mine, most righteously. For me, the third,\nWhen butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared\nAnd cast me with my broken sire that day,\nA little thing in swaddling clothes, away\nTo exile; where I grew, and at the last\nJustice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast\nIn a far land, mine arm hath reached this king;\nMy brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling;\nAnd all is well. I have seen mine enemy\nDead in the snare, and care not if I die!\nLEADER.\nAigisthos, to insult over the dead\nI like not. All the counsel, thou hast said,\nWas thine alone; and thine the will that spilled\nThis piteous blood. As justice is fulfilled,\nThou shalt not ’scape—so my heart presageth—-The\nday of cursing and the hurlèd death.\nAIGISTHOS.\nHow, thou poor oarsman of the nether row,\nWhen the main deck is master? Sayst thou so?…\nTo such old heads the lesson may prove hard,\nI fear me, when Obedience is the word.\nBut hunger, and bonds, and cold, help men to find\nTheir wits.—They are wondrous healers of the mind!\nHast eyes and seest not this?—Against a spike\nKick not, for fear it pain thee if thou strike.\nLEADER (turning from him to CLYTEMNESTRA).\nWoman! A soldier fresh from war! To keep\nWatch o’er his house and shame him in his sleep…\nTo plot this craft against a lord of spears…\n[CLYTEMNESTRA, as though in a dream, pays no heed. AIGISTHOS interupts.]\nAIGISTHOS.\nThese be the words, old man, that lead to tears!\nThou hast an opposite to Orpheus’ tongue,\nWho chained all things with his enchanting song,\nFor thy mad noise will put the chains on thee.\nEnough! Once mastered thou shalt tamer be.\nLEADER.\nThou master? Is old Argos so accurst?\nThou plotter afar off, who never durst\nRaise thine own hand to affront and strike him down…\nAIGISTHOS.\nTo entice him was the wife’s work. I was known\nBy all men here, his old confessed blood-foe.\nHowbeit, with his possessions I will know\nHow to be King. And who obeys not me\nShall be yoked hard, no easy trace-horse he,\nCorn-flushed. Hunger, and hunger’s prison mate,\nThe clammy murk, shall see his rage abate.\nLEADER.\nThou craven soul! Why not in open strife\nSlay him? Why lay the blood-sin on his wife,\nStaining the Gods of Argos, making ill\nThe soil thereof?…But young Orestes still\nLiveth. Oh, Fate will guide him home again,\nAvenging, conquering, home to kill these twain!\nAIGISTHOS.\n’Fore God, if ’tis your pleasure thus to speak and do, ye soon shall hear!\nHo there, my trusty pikes, advance!

Stand and be ready, sword from sheath!\nAIGISTHOS.\nBy Heaven, I also, sword in hand, am ready, and refuse not death!\nLEADER.\nCome, find it! We accept thy word. Thou offerest what we hunger for.\n[Some of the Elders draw swords with the Leader; others have collapsed with weakness. Men from AGAMEMNON’S retinue have gathered and prepare for battle, when, before they can come to blows, CLYTEMNESTRA breaks from her exhausted silence.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNay, peace, O best-belovèd! Peace! And let us work no evil more.\nSurely the reaping of the past is a full harvest, and not good,\nAnd wounds enough are everywhere.—Let us not stain ourselves with blood.\nYe reverend Elders, go your ways, to his own dwelling every one,\nEre things be wrought for which men suffer.—What we did must needs be done.\nAnd if of all these strifes we now may have no more, oh, I will kneel\nAnd praise God, bruisèd though we be beneath the Daemon’s heavy heel.\nThis is the word a woman speaks, to hear if any man will deign.\nAIGISTHOS.\nAnd who are these to burst in flower of folly thus of tongue and brain,\nAnd utter words of empty sound and perilous, tempting Fortune’s frown,\nAnd leave wise counsel all forgot, and gird at him who wears the crown?\nLEADER.\nTo cringe before a caitiff’s crown, it squareth not with Argive ways.\nAIGISTHOS.

    "content":"THE LIBATION-BEARERS\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nORESTES\nCHORUS OF CAPTIVE WOMEN\nELECTRA\nA NURSE\nCLYTEMNESTRA\nAEGISTHUS\nAN ATTENDANT\nPYLADES\nThe Scene is the Tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae; afterwards, the Palace of Atreus, hard by the Tomb.\nOrestes\nLord of the shades and patron of the realm\nThat erst my father swayed, list now my prayer,\nHermes, and save me with thine aiding arm,\nMe who from banishment returning stand\nOn this my country; lo, my foot is set\nOn this grave-mound, and herald-like, as thou,\nOnce and again, I bid my father hear.\nAnd these twin locks, from mine head shorn, I bring,\nAnd one to Inachus the river-god,\nMy young life’s nurturer, I dedicate,\nAnd one in sign of mourning unfulfilled\nI lay, though late, on this my father’s grave.\nFor O my father, not beside thy corse\nStood I to wail thy death, nor was my hand\nStretched out to bear thee forth to burial.\nWhat sight is yonder? what this woman-throng\nHitherward coming, by their sable garb\nMade manifest as mourners? What hath chanced?\nDoth some new sorrow hap within the home?\nOr rightly may I deem that they draw near\nBearing libations, such as soothe the ire\nOf dead men angered, to my father’s grave?\nNay, such they are indeed; for I descry\nElectra mine own sister pacing hither,\nIn moody grief conspicuous. Grant, O Zeus,\nGrant me my father’s murder to avenge—\nBe thou my willing champion!\nPylades,\nPass we aside, till rightly I discern\nWherefore these women throng in suppliance.\n[Exeunt Pylades and Orestes; enter the Chorus bearing vessels for libation; Electra follows them; they pace slowly towards the tomb of Agamemnon.\nCHORUS\nForth from the royal halls by high command\nI bear libations for the dead.\nRings on my smitten breast my smiting hand,\nAnd all my cheek is rent and red,\nFresh-furrowed by my nails, and all my soul\nThis many a day doth feed on cries of dole.\nAnd trailing tatters of my vest,\nIn looped and windowed raggedness forlorn,\nHang rent around my breast,\nEven as I, by blows of Fate most stern\nSaddened and torn.\nOracular thro’ visions, ghastly clear,\nBearing a blast of wrath from realms below,\nAnd stiffening each rising hair with dread,\nCame out of dream-land Fear,\nAnd, loud and awful, bade\nThe shriek ring out at midnight’s witching hour,\nAnd brooded, stern with woe,\nAbove the inner house, the woman’s bower.\nAnd seers inspired did read the dream on oath,\nChanting aloud In realms below\nThe dead are wroth;\nAgainst their slayers yet their ire doth glow.\nTherefore to bear this gift of graceless worth—\nO Earth, my nursing mother!—\nThe woman god-accurs’d doth send me forth\nLest one crime bring another.\nIll is the very word to speak, for none\nCan ransom or atone\nFor blood once shed and darkening the plain.\nO hearth of woe and bane,\nO state that low doth lie!\nSunless, accursed of men, the shadows brood\nAbove the home of murdered majesty.\nRumour of might, unquestioned, unsubdued,\nPervading ears and soul of lesser men,\nIs silent now and dead.\nYet rules a viler dread;\nFor bliss and power, however won,\nAs gods, and more than gods, dazzle our mortal ken.\nJustice doth mark, with scales that swiftly sway,\nSome that are yet in light;\nOthers in interspace of day and night,\nTill Fate arouse them, stay;\nAnd some are lapped in night, where all things are undone.\nOn the life-giving lap of Earth\nBlood hath flowed forth;\nAnd now, the seed of vengeance, clots the plain—\nUnmelting, uneffaced the stain.\nAnd Atè tarries long, but at the last\nThe sinner’s heart is cast\nInto pervading, waxing pangs of pain.\nLo, when man’s force doth ope\nThe virgin doors, there is nor cure nor hope\nFor what is lost,—even so, I deem,\nThough in one channel ran Earth’s every stream,\nLaving the hand defiled from murder’s stain,\nIt were vain.\nAnd upon me—ah me!—the gods have laid\nThe woe that wrapped round Troy,\nWhat time they led down from home and kin\nUnto a slave’s employ—\nThe doom to bow the head\nAnd watch our master’s will\nWork deeds of good and ill—\nTo see the headlong sway of force and sin,\nAnd hold restrained the spirit’s bitter hate,\nWailing the monarch’s fruitless fate,\nHiding my face within my robe, and fain\nOf tears, and chilled with frost of hidden pain.\nELECTRA\nHand maidens, orderers of the palace-halls,\nSince at my side ye come, a suppliant train,\nCompanions of this offering, counsel me\nAs best befits the time: for I, who pour\nUpon the grave these streams funereal,\nWith what fair word can I invoke my sire?\nShall I aver, Behold, I bear these gifts\nFrom well-beloved wife unto her well-beloved lord,\nWhen ’tis from her, my mother, that they come?\nI dare not say it: of all words I fail\nWherewith to consecrate unto my sire\nThese sacrificial honours on his grave.\nOr shall I speak this word, as mortals use—\nGive back, to those who send these coronals\nFull recompense—of ills for acts malign?\nOr shall I pour this draught for Earth to drink,\nSans word or reverence, as my sire was slain,\nAnd homeward pass with unreverted eyes,\nCasting the bowl away, as one who flings\nThe household cleansings to the common road?\nBe art and part, O friends, in this my doubt,\nEven as ye are in that one common hate\nWhereby we live attended: fear ye not\nThe wrath of any man, nor hide your word\nWithin your breast: the day of death and doom\nAwaits alike the freeman and the slave.\nSpeak, then, if aught thou know’st to aid us more.\nCHORUS\nThou biddest; I will speak my soul’s thought out,\nRevering as a shrine thy father’s grave.\nELECTRA\nSay then thy say, as thou his tomb reverest.\nCHORUS\nSpeak solemn words to them that love, and pour.\nELECTRA\nAnd of his kin whom dare I name as kind?\nCHORUS\nThyself; and next, whoe’er Aegisthus scorns.\nELECTRA\nThen ’tis myself and thou, my prayer must name.\nCHORUS\nWhoe’er they be, ’tis thine to know and name them.\nELECTRA\nIs there no other we may claim as ours?\nCHORUS\nThink of Orestes, though far-off he be.\nELECTRA\nRight well in this too hast thou schooled my thought.\nCHORUS\nMindfully, next, on those who shed the blood—\nELECTRA\nPray on them what? expound, instruct my doubt.\nCHORUS\nThis; Upon them some god or mortal come——\nELECTRA\nAs judge or as avenger? speak thy thought.\nCHORUS\nPray in set terms, Who shall the slayer slay.\nELECTRA\nBeseemeth it to ask such boon of heaven?\nCHORUS\nHow not, to wreak a wrong upon a foe?\nELECTRA\nO mighty Hermes, warder of the shades,\nHerald of upper and of under world,\nProclaim and usher down my prayer’s appeal\nUnto the gods below, that they with eyes\nWatchful behold these halls, my sire’s of old—\nAnd unto Earth, the mother of all things,\nAnd foster-nurse, and womb that takes their seed.\nLo, I that pour these draughts for men now dead,\nCall on my father, who yet holds in ruth\nMe and mine own Orestes, Father, speak—\nHow shall thy children rule thine halls again?\nHomeless we are and sold; and she who sold\nIs she who bore us; and the price she took\nIs he who joined with her to work thy death,\nAegisthus, her new lord. Behold me here\nBrought down to slave’s estate, and far away\nWanders Orestes, banished from the wealth\nThat once was thine, the profit of thy care,\nWhereon these revel in a shameful joy.\nFather, my prayer is said; ’tis thine to hear—\nGrant that some fair fate bring Orestes home,\nAnd unto me grant these—a purer soul\nThan is my mother’s, a more stainless hand.\nThese be my prayers for us; for thee, O sire,\nI cry that one may come to smite thy foes,\nAnd that the slayers may in turn be slain.\nCursed is their prayer, and thus I bar its path,\nPraying mine own, a counter-curse on them.\nAnd thou, send up to us the righteous boon\nFor which we pray: thine aids be heaven and earth,\nAnd justice guide the right to victory,\n[To the Chorus.\nThus have I prayed, and thus I shed these streams,\nAnd follow ye the wont, and as with flowers\nCrown ye with many a tear and cry the dirge,\nYour lips ring out above the dead man’s grave.\n[She pours the libations.\nCHORUS\nWoe, woe, woe!\nLet the teardrop fall, plashing on the ground\nWhere our lord lies low:\nFall and cleanse away the cursed libation’s stain,\nShed on this grave-mound,\nFenced wherein together, gifts of good or bane\nFrom the dead are found.\nLord of Argos, hearken!\nThough around thee darken\nMist of death and hell, arise and hear!\nHearken and awaken to our cry of woe!\nWho with might of spear\nShall our home deliver?\nWho like Ares bend until it quiver,\nBend the northern bow?\nWho with hand upon the hilt himself will thrust with glaive,\nThrust and slay and save?\nELECTRA\nLo! the earth drinks them, to my sire they pass—\nLearn ye with me of this thing new and strange.\nCHORUS\nSpeak thou; my breast doth palpitate with fear.\nELECTRA\nI see upon the tomb a curl new shorn.\nCHORUS\nShorn from what man or what deep-girded maid?\nELECTRA\nThat may he guess who will; the sign is plain.\nCHORUS\nLet me learn this of thee; let youth prompt age.\nELECTRA\nNone is there here but I, to clip such gift.\nCHORUS\nFor they who thus should mourn him hate him sore.\nELECTRA\nAnd lo! in truth the hair exceeding like—\nCHORUS\nLike to what locks and whose? instruct me that.\nELECTRA\nLike unto those my father’s children wear.\nCHORUS\nThen is this lock Orestes’ secret gift?\nELECTRA\nMost like it is unto the curls he wore,\nCHORUS\nYet how dared he to come unto his home?\nELECTRA\nHe hath but sent it, clipt to mourn his sire.\nCHORUS\nIt is a sorrow grievous as his death,\nThat he should live yet never dare return.\nELECTRA\nYea, and my heart o’erflows with gall of grief,\nAnd I am pierced as with a cleaving dart;\nLike to the first drops after drought, my tears\nFall down at will, a bitter bursting tide,\nAs on this lock I gaze; I cannot deem\nThat any Argive save Orestes’ self\nWas ever lord thereof; nor, well I wot,\nHath she, the murd’ress, shorn and laid this lock\nTo mourn him whom she slew—my mother she,\nBearing no mother’s heart, but to her race\nA loathing spirit, loathed itself of heaven!\nYet to affirm, as utterly made sure,\nThat this adornment cometh of the hand\nOf mine Orestes, brother of my soul,\nI may not venture, yet hope flatters fair!\nAh well-a-day, that this dumb hair had voice\nTo glad mine ears, as might a messenger,\nBidding me sway no more ’twixt fear and hope,\nClearly commanding, Cast me hence away,\nClipped was I from some head thou lovest not;\nOr, I am kin to thee, and here, as thou,\nI come to weep and deck our father’s grave.\nAid me, ye gods! for well indeed ye know\nHow in the gale and counter-gale of doubt,\nLike to the seaman’s bark, we whirl and stray.\nBut, if God will our life, how strong shall spring,\nFrom seed how small, the new tree of our home!—\nLo ye, a second sign—these footsteps, look,—\nLike to my own, a corresponsive print;\nAnd look, another footmark,—this his own,\nAnd that the foot of one who walked with him.\nMark, how the heel and tendons’ print combine,\nMeasured exact, with mine coincident!\nAlas! for doubt and anguish rack my mind.\nORESTES (approaching suddenly)\nPray thou, in gratitude for prayers fulfilled, Fair fall the rest of what I ask of heaven.\nELECTRA\nWherefore? what win I from the gods by prayer?\nORESTES\nThis, that thine eyes behold thy heart’s desire.\nELECTRA\nOn whom of mortals know’st thou that I call?\nORESTES\nI know thy yearning for Orestes deep.\nELECTRA\nSay then, wherein event hath crowned my prayer?\nORESTES\nI, I am he; seek not one more akin.\nELECTRA\nSome fraud, O stranger, weavest thou for me?\nORESTES\nAgainst myself I weave it, if I weave.\nELECTRA\nAh, thou hast mind to mock me in my woe!\nORESTES\n’Tis at mine own I mock then, mocking thine.\nELECTRA\nSpeak I with thee then as Orestes’ self?\nORESTES\nMy very face thou see’st and know’st me not,\nAnd yet but now, when thou didst see the lock\nShorn for my father’s grave, and when thy quest\nWas eager on the footprints I had made,\nEven I, thy brother, shaped and sized as thou,\nFluttered thy spirit, as at sight of me!\nLay now this ringlet whence ’twas shorn, and judge,\nAnd look upon this robe, thine own hands’ work,\nThe shuttle-prints, the creature wrought thereon—\nRefrain thyself, nor prudence lose in joy,\nFor well I wot, our kin are less than kind.\nELECTRA\nO thou that art unto our father’s home\nLove, grief and hope, for thee the tears ran down,\nFor thee, the son, the saviour that should be;\nTrust thou thine arm and win thy father’s halls!\nO aspect sweet of fourfold love to me,\nWhom upon thee the heart’s constraint bids call\nAs on my father, and the claim of love\nFrom me unto my mother turns to thee,\nFor she is very hate; to thee too turns\nWhat of my heart went out to her who died\nA ruthless death upon the altar-stone;\nAnd for myself I love thee—thee that wast\nA brother leal, sole stay of love to me.\nNow by thy side be strength and right, and Zeus\nSaviour almighty, stand to aid the twain!\nORESTES\nZeus, Zeus! look down on our estate and us,\nThe orphaned brood of him, our eagle-sire,\nWhom to his death a fearful serpent brought\nEnwinding him in coils; and we, bereft\nAnd foodless, sink with famine, all too weak\nTo bear unto the eyrie, as he bore,\nSuch quarry as he slew. Lo! I and she,\nElectra, stand before thee, fatherless,\nAnd each alike cast out and homeless made.\nELECTRA\nAnd if thou leave to death the brood of him\nWhose altar blazed for thee, whose reverence\nWas thine, all thine,—whence, in the after years,\nShall any hand like his adorn thy shrine\nWith sacrifice of flesh? the eaglets slain,\nThou wouldst not have a messenger to bear\nThine omens, once so clear, to mortal men;\nSo, if this kingly stock be withered all,\nNone on high festivals will fend thy shrine\nStoop thou to raise us! strong the race shall show,\nThough puny now it seem, and fallen low.\nCHORUS\nO children, saviours of your father’s home,\nBeware ye of your words, lest one should hear\nAnd bear them, for the tongue hath lust to tell,\nUnto our masters—whom God grant to me\nIn pitchy reek of fun’ral flame to see!\nORESTES\nNay, mighty is Apollo’s oracle\nAnd shall not fail me, whom it bade to pass\nThro’ all this peril; clear the voice rang out\nWith many warnings, sternly threatening\nTo my hot heart the wintry chill of pain,\nUnless upon the slayers of my sire\nI pressed for vengeance: this the god’s command—\nThat I, in ire for home and wealth despoiled,\nShould with a craft like theirs the slayers slay:\nElse with my very life I should atone\nThis deed undone, in many a ghastly wise\nFor he proclaimed unto the ears of men\nThat offerings, poured to angry power of death,\nExude again, unless their will be done,\nAs grim disease on those that poured them forth—\nAs leprous ulcers mounting on the flesh\nAnd with fell fangs corroding what of old\nWore natural form; and on the brow arise\nWhite poisoned hairs, the crown of this disease.\nHe spake moreover of assailing fiends\nEmpowered to quit on me my father’s blood,\nWreaking their wrath on me, what time in night\nBeneath shut lids the spirit’s eye sees clear.\nThe dart that flies in darkness, sped from hell\nBy spirits of the murdered dead who call\nUnto their kin for vengeance, formless fear,\nThe night-tide’s visitant, and madness’ curse\nShould drive and rack me; and my tortured frame\nShould be chased forth from man’s community\nAs with the brazen scorpions of the scourge.\nFor me and such as me no lustral bowl\nShould stand, no spilth of wine be poured to God\nFor me, and wrath unseen of my dead sire\nShould drive me from the shrine; no man should dare\nTo take me to his hearth, nor dwell with me:\nSlow, friendless, cursed of all should be mine end,\nAnd pitiless horror wind me for the grave,\nThis spake the god—this dare I disobey?\nYea, though I dared, the deed must yet be done;\nFor to that end diverse desires combine,—\nThe god’s behest, deep grief for him who died,\nAnd last, the grievous blank of wealth despoiled—\nAll these weigh on me, urge that Argive men,\nMinions of valour, who with soul of fire\nDid make of fencèd Troy a ruinous heap,\nBe not left slaves to two and each a woman!\nFor he, the man, wears woman’s heart; if not\nSoon shall he know, confronted by a man.\n[Orestes, Electra, and the Chorus gather round the tomb of Agamemnon for the invocation which follows.\nCHORUS\nMighty Fates, on you we call!\nBid the will of Zeus ordain\nPower to those, to whom again\nJustice turns with hand and aid!\nGrievous was the prayer one made—\nGrievous let the answer fall!\nWhere the mighty doom is set,\nJustice claims aloud her debt\nWho in blood hath dipped the steel,\nDeep in blood her meed shall feel!\nList an immemorial word—\nWhosoe’er shall take the sword\nShall perish by the sword.\nORESTES\nFather, unblest in death, O father mine!\nWhat breath of word or deed\nCan I waft on thee from this far confine\nUnto thy lowly bed,—\nWaft upon thee, in midst of darkness lying,\nHope’s counter-gleam of fire?\nYet the loud dirge of praise brings grace undying\nUnto each parted sire.\nCHORUS\nO child, the spirit of the dead,\nAltho’ upon his flesh have fed\nThe grim teeth of the flame,\nIs quelled not; after many days\nThe sting of wrath his soul shall raise,\nA vengeance to reclaim!\nTo the dead rings loud our cry—\nPlain the living’s treachery—\nSwelling, shrilling, urged on high,\nThe vengeful dirge, for parents slain,\nShall strive and shall attain.\nELECTRA\nHear me too, even me, O father, hear!\nNot by one child alone these groans, these tears are shed\nUpon thy sepulchre.\nEach, each, where thou art lowly laid,\nStands, a suppliant, homeless made:\nAh, and all is full of ill,\nComfort is there none to say!\nStrive and wrestle as we may,\nStill stands doom invincible.\nCHORUS\nNay, if so he will, the god\nStill our tears to joy can turn\nHe can bid a triumph-ode\nDrown the dirge beside this urn;\nHe to kingly halls can greet\nThe child restored, the homeward-guided feet.\nORESTES\nAh my father! hadst thou lain\nUnder Ilion’s wall,\nBy some Lycian spearman slain,\nThou hadst left in this thine hall\nHonour; thou hadst wrought for us\nFame and life most glorious.\nOver-seas if thou had’st died,\nHeavily had stood thy tomb,\nHeaped on high; but, quenched in pride,\nGrief were light unto thy home.\nCHORUS\nLoved and honoured hadst thou lain\nBy the dead that nobly fell,\nIn the under-world again,\nWhere are throned the kings of hell,\nFull of sway adorable\nThou hadst stood at their right hand—\nThou that wert, in mortal land,\nBy Fate’s ordinance and law,\nKing of kings who bear the crown\nAnd the staff, to which in awe\nMortal men bow down.\nELECTRA\nNay O father, I were fain\nOther fate had fallen on thee.\nIll it were if thou hadst lain\nOne among the common slain,\nFallen by Scamander’s side—\nThose who slew thee there should be!\nThen, untouched by slavery,\nWe had heard as from afar\nDeaths of those who should have died\n’Mid the chance of war.\nCHORUS\nO child, forbear! things all too high thou sayest.\nEasy, but vain, thy cry!\nA boon above all gold is that thou prayest,\nAn unreached destiny,\nAs of the blessèd land that far aloof\nBeyond the north wind lies;\nYet doth your double prayer ring loud reproof;\nA double scourge of sighs\nAwakes the dead; th’ avengers rise, though late;\nBlood stains the guilty pride\nOf the accursed who rule on earth, and Fate\nStands on the children’s side.\nELECTRA\nThat hath sped thro’ mine ear, like a shaft from a bow!\nZeus, Zeus! it is thou who dost send from below\nA doom on the desperate doer—ere long\nOn a mother a father shall visit his wrong.\nCHORUS\nBe it mine to upraise thro’ the reek of the pyre\nThe chant of delight, while the funeral fire\nDevoureth the corpse of a man that is slain\nAnd a woman laid low!\nFor who bids me conceal it! out-rending control,\nBlows ever stern blast of hate thro’ my soul,\nAnd before me a vision of wrath and of bane\nFlits and waves to and fro.\nORESTES\nZeus, thou alone to us art parent now.\nSmite with a rending blow\nUpon their heads, and bid the land be well:\nSet right where wrong hath stood; and thou give ear,\nO Earth, unto my prayer—\nYea, hear O mother Earth, and monarchy of hell!\nCHORUS\nNay, the law is sternly set—\nBlood-drops shed upon the ground\nPlead for other bloodshed yet;\nLoud the call of death doth sound,\nCalling guilt of olden time,\nA Fury, crowning crime with crime.\nELECTRA\nWhere, where are ye, avenging powers,\nPuissant Furies of the slain?\nBehold the relics of the race\nOf Atreus, thrust from pride of place!\nO Zeus, what home henceforth is ours,\nWhat refuge to attain?\nCHORUS\nLo, at your wail my heart throbs, wildly stirred;\nNow am I lorn with sadness,\nDarkened in all my soul, to hear your sorrow’s word.\nAnon to hope, the seat of strength, I rise,—\nShe, thrusting grief away, lifts up mine eyes\nTo the new dawn of gladness.\nORESTES\nSkills it to tell of aught save wrong on wrong,\nWrought by our mother’s deed?\nThough now she fawn for pardon, sternly strong\nStandeth our wrath, and will nor hear nor heed;\nHer children’s soul is wolfish, born from hers,\nAnd softens not by prayers.\nCHORUS\nI dealt upon my breast the blow\nThat Asian mourning women know;\nWails from my breast the fun’ral cry,\nThe Cissian weeping melody;\nStretched rendingly forth, to tatter and tear,\nMy clenched hands wander, here and there,\nFrom head to breast; distraught with blows\nThrob dizzily my brows.\nELECTRA\nAweless in hate, O mother, sternly brave!\nAs in a foeman’s grave\nThou laid’st in earth a king, but to the bier\nNo citizen drew near,—\nThy husband, thine, yet for his obsequies,\nThou bad’st no wail arise!\nORESTES\nAlas the shameful burial thou dost speak!\nYet I the vengeance of his shame will wreak—\nThat do the gods command!\nThat shall achieve mine hand!\nGrant me to thrust her life away, and I\nWill dare to die!\nCHORUS\nList thou the deed!

I now stand here,\nMade glad, made sad with blood, exulting, wailing—\nHear, O thou woven web that slew my sire!\nI grieve for deed and death and all my home—\nVictor, pollution’s damnèd stain for prize.\nCHORUS\nAlas, that none of mortal men\nCan pass his life untouched by pain!\nBehold, one woe is here—\nAnother loometh near.\nORESTES\nHark ye and learn—for what the end shall be\nFor me I know not: breaking from the curb\nMy spirit whirls me off, a conquered prey,\nBorne as a charioteer by steeds distraught\nFar from the course, and madness in my breast\nBurneth to chant its song, and leap, and rave—\nHark ye and learn, friends, ere my reason goes!\nI say that rightfully I slew my mother,\nA thing God-scorned, that foully slew my sire\nAnd chiefest wizard of the spell that bound me\nUnto this deed I name the Pythian seer\nApollo, who foretold that if I slew,\nThe guilt of murder done should pass from me;\nBut if I spared, the fate that should be mine\nI dare not blazon forth—the bow of speech\nCan reach not to the mark, that doom to tell.\nAnd now behold me, how with branch and crown\nI pass, a suppliant made meet to go\nUnto Earth’s midmost shrine, the holy ground\nOf Loxias, and that renownèd light\nOf ever-burning fire, to ’scape the doom\nOf kindred murder: to no other shrine\n(So Loxias bade) may I for refuge turn.\nBear witness, Argives, in the after time,\nHow came on me this dread fatality.\nLiving, I pass a banished wanderer hence,\nTo leave in death the memory of this cry.\nCHORUS\nNay, but the deed is well; link not thy lips\nTo speech ill-starred, nor vent ill-boding words—\nWho hast to Argos her full freedom given,\nLopping two serpents’ heads with timely blow.\nORESTES\nLook, look, alas!\nHandmaidens, see—what Gorgon shapes throng up;\nDusky their robes and all their hair enwound—\nSnakes coiled with snakes—off, off, I must away!\nCHORUS\nMost loyal of all sons unto thy sire,\nWhat visions thus distract thee? Hold, abide;\nGreat was thy victory, and shalt thou fear?\nORESTES\nThese are no dreams, void shapes of haunting ill,\nBut clear to sight my mother’s hell-hounds come!\nCHORUS\nNay, the fresh bloodshed still imbrues thine hands,\nAnd thence distraction sinks into thy soul.\nORESTES\nO king Apollo—see, they swarm and throng—\nBlack blood of hatred dripping from their eyes!\nCHORUS\nOne remedy thou hast; go, touch the shrine\nOf Loxias, and rid thee of these woes.\nORESTES\nYe can behold them not, but I behold them.\nUp and away! I dare abide no more.\n[Exit\nCHORUS\nFarewell then as thou mayst,—the god thy friend\nGuard thee and aid with chances favouring.\nBehold, the storm of woe divine\nThat the raves and beats on Atreus’ line\nIts great third blast hath blown.\nFirst was Thyestes’ loathly woe—\nThe rueful feast of long ago,\nOn children’s flesh, unknown.\nAnd next the kingly chief’s despite,\nWhen he who led the Greeks to fight\nWas in the bath hewn down.\nAnd now the offspring of the race\nStands in the third, the saviour’s place,\nTo save—or to consume?\nO whither, ere it be fulfilled,\nEre its fierce blast be hushed and stilled,\nShall blow the wind of doom?\n[Exeunt.]",

She, in after time,\nGave o’er the throne, as birthgift to a god,\nPhoebus, who in his own bears Phoebe’s name.\nHe from the lake and ridge of Delos’ isle\nSteered to the port of Pallas’ Attic shores,\nThe home of ships; and thence he passed and came\nUnto this land and to Parnassus’ shrine.\nAnd at his side, with awe revering him,\nThere went the children of Hephaestus’ seed,\nThe hewers of the sacred way, who tame\nThe stubborn tract that erst was wilderness.\nAnd all this folk, and Delphos, chieftain-king\nOf this their land, with honour gave him home;\nAnd in his breast Zeus set a prophet’s soul,\nAnd gave to him this throne, whereon he sits,\nFourth prophet of the shrine, and, Loxias hight,\nGives voice to that which Zeus his sire decrees.\nSuch gods I name in my preluding prayer,\nAnd after them, I call with honour due\nOn Pallas, wardress of the fane, and Nymphs\nWho dwell around the rock Corycian,\nWhere in the hollow cave, the wild birds’ haunt,\nWander the feet of lesser gods; and there,\nRight well I know it, Bromian Bacchus dwells,\nSince he in godship led his Maenad host,\nDevising death for Pentheus, whom they rent\nPiecemeal, as hare among the hounds. And last,\nI call on Pleistus’ springs, Poseidon’s might,\nAnd Zeus most high, the great Accomplisher.\nThen as a seeress to the sacred chair\nI pass and sit; and may the powers divine\nMake this mine entrance fruitful in response\nBeyond each former advent, triply blest.\nAnd if there stand without, from Hellas bound,\nMen seeking oracles, let each pass in\nIn order of the lot, as use allows;\nFor the god guides whate’er my tongue proclaims.\n[She goes into the interior of the temple; after a short interval, she returns in great fear.\nThings fell to speak of, fell for eyes to see,\nHave sped me forth again from Loxias’ shrine,\nWith strength unstrung, moving erect no more,\nBut aiding with my hands my failing feet,\nUnnerved by fear. A beldame’s force is naught—\nIs as a child’s, when age and fear combine.\nFor as I pace towards the inmost fane\nBay-filleted by many a suppliant’s hand,\nLo, at the central altar I descry\nOne crouching as for refuge—yea, a man\nAbhorredd of heaven; and from his hands, wherein\nA sword new-drawn he holds, blood reeked and fell:\nA wand he bears, the olive’s topmost bough,\nTwined as of purpose with a deep close tuft\nOf whitest wool. This, that I plainly saw,\nPlainly I tell. But lo, in front of him,\nCrouched on the altar-steps, a grisly band\nOf women slumbers—not like women they,\nBut Gorgons rather; nay, that word is weak,\nNor may I match the Gorgons’ shape with theirs!\nSuch have I seen in painted semblance erst—\nWinged Harpies, snatching food from Phineus’ board,—\nBut these are wingless, black, and all their shape\nThe eye’s abomination to behold.\nFell is the breath—let none draw nigh to it—\nWherewith they snort in slumber; from their eyes\nExude the damnèd drops of poisonous ire:\nAnd such their garb as none should dare to bring\nTo statues of the gods or homes of men.\nI wot not of the tribe wherefrom can come\nSo fell a legion, nor in what land Earth\nCould rear, unharmed, such creatures, nor avow\nThat she had travailed and brought forth death.\nBut, for the rest, be all these things a care\nUnto the mighty Loxias, the lord\nOf this our shrine: healer and prophet he,\nDiscerner he of portents, and the cleanser\nOf other homes—behold, his own to cleanse!\n[Exit.\n[The scene opens, disclosing the interior of the temple: Orestes clings to the central altar; the Furies lie slumbering at a little distance; Apollo and Hermes appear from the innermost shrine.\nAPOLLO\nLo, I desert thee never: to the end,\nHard at thy side as now, or sundered far,\nI am thy guard, and to thine enemies\nImplacably oppose me: look on them,\nThese greedy fiends, beneath my craft subdued!\nSee, they are fallen on sleep, these beldames old,\nUnto whose grim and wizened maidenhood\nNor god nor man nor beast can e’er draw near.\nYea, evil were they born, for evil’s doom,\nEvil the dark abyss of Tartarus\nWherein they dwell, and they themselves the hate\nOf men on earth, and of Olympian gods.\nBut thou, flee far and with unfaltering speed;\nFor they shall hunt thee through the mainland wide\nWhere’er throughout the tract of travelled earth\nThy foot may roam, and o’er and o’er the seas\nAnd island homes of men. Faint not nor fail,\nToo soon and timidly within thy breast\nShepherding thoughts forlorn of this thy toil;\nBut unto Pallas’ city go, and there\nCrouch at her shrine, and in thine arms enfold\nHer ancient image: there we well shall find\nMeet judges for this cause and suasive pleas,\nSkilled to contrive for thee deliverance\nFrom all this woe. Be such my pledge to thee,\nFor by my hest thou didst thy mother slay.\nORESTES\nO king Apollo, since right well thou know’st\nWhat justice bids, have heed, fulfil the same,—\nThy strength is all-sufficient to achieve.\nAPOLLO\nHave thou too heed, nor let thy fear prevail\nAbove thy will. And do thou guard him, Hermes,\nWhose blood is brother unto mine, whose sire\nThe same high God. Men call thee guide and guard,\nGuide therefore thou and guard my suppliant;\nFor Zeus himself reveres the outlaw’s right,\nBoon of fair escort, upon man conferred.\n[Exeunt Apollo, Hermes, and Orestes. The Ghost of Clytemnestra near\nGHOST OF CLYTEMNESTRA\nSleep on! awake! what skills your sleep to me—\nMe, among all the dead by you dishonoured—\nMe from whom never, in the world of death,\nDieth this curse, ’Tis she who smote and slew,\nAnd shamed and scorned I roam? Awake, and hear\nMy plaint of dead men’s hate intolerable.\nMe, sternly slain by them that should have loved,\nMe doth no god arouse him to avenge,\nHewn down in blood by matricidal hands.\nMark ye these wounds from which the heart’s blood ran,\nAnd by whose hand, bethink ye! for the sense\nWhen shut in sleep hath then the spirit-sight,\nBut in the day the inward eye is blind.\nList, ye who drank so oft with lapping tongue\nThe wineless draught by me outpoured to soothe\nYour vengeful ire! how oft on kindled shrine\nI laid the feast of darkness, at the hour\nAbhorred of every god but you alone!\nLo, all my service trampled down and scorned!\nAnd he hath baulked your chase, as stag the hounds;\nYea, lightly bounding from the circling toils,\nHath wried his face in scorn, and flieth far.\nAwake and hear—for mine own soul I cry—\nAwake, ye powers of hell! the wandering ghost\nThat once was Clytemnestra calls—Arise!\n[The Furies mutter grimly, as in a dream.\nMutter and murmur! He hath flown afar— My kin have gods to guard them, I have none!\n[The Furies mutter as before.\nO drowsed in sleep too deep to heed my pain!\nOrestes flies, who me, his mother, slew.\n[The Furies give a confused cry.\nYelping, and drowsed again? Up and be doing\nThat which alone is yours, the deed of hell!\n[The Furies give another cry.\nLo, sleep and toil, the sworn confederates,\nHave quelled your dragon-anger, once so fell!\nTHE FURIES (muttering more fiercely and loudly)\nSeize, seize, seize, seize—mark, yonder!\nGHOST\nIn dreams ye chase a prey, and like some hound,\nThat even in sleep doth ply his woodland toil,\nYe bell and bay. What do ye, sleeping here?\nBe not o’ercome with toil, nor sleep-subdued,\nBe heedless of my wrong. Up! thrill your heart\nWith the just chidings of my tongue,—such words\nAre as a spur to purpose firmly held.\nBlow forth on him the breath of wrath and blood,\nScorch him with reek of fire that burns in you,\nWaste him with new pursuit—swift, hound him down!\n[Ghost sinks.\nFIRST FURY (awaking)\nUp! rouse another as I rouse thee; up!\nSleep’st thou? Rise up, and spurning sleep away,\nSee we if false to us this prelude rang.\nCHORUS OF FURIES\nAlack, alack, O sisters, we have toiled,\nO much and vainly have we toiled and borne!\nVainly! and all we wrought the gods have foiled,\nAnd turnèd us to scorn!\nHe hath slipped from the net, whom we chased: he\nhath ’scaped us who should be our prey—\nO’ermastered by slumber we sank, and our quarry hath stolen away!\nThou, child of the high God Zeus, Apollo, hast robbed us and wronged;\nThou, a youth, hast down-trodden the right that is godship more ancient belonged;\nThou hast cherished thy suppliant man; the slayer the God-forsaken,\nThe bane of a parent, by craft from out of our grasp thou hast taken:\nA god, thou hast stolen from us the avengers a matricide son—\nAnd who shall consider thy deed and say, It is rightfully done?\nThe sound of chiding scorn\nCame from the land of dream;\nDeep to mine inmost heart I felt it thrill and burn,\nThrust as a strong-grasped goad, to urge\nOnward the chariot’s team.\nThrilled, chilled with bitter inward pain\nI stand as one beneath the doomsman’s scourge.\nShame on the younger gods who tread down right,\nSitting on thrones of might!\nWoe on the altar of earth’s central fane!\nClotted on step and shrine,\nBehold, the guilt of blood, the ghastly stain!\nWoe upon thee, Apollo! uncontrolled,\nUnbidden, hast thou, prophet-god, imbrued\nThe pure prophetic shrine with wrongful blood!\nFor thou too heinous a respect didst hold\nOf man, too little heed of powers divine!\nAnd us the Fates, the ancients of the earth,\nDidst deem as nothing worth.\nScornful to me thou art, yet shalt not fend\nMy wrath from him; though unto hell he flee,\nThere too are we!\nAnd he the blood defiled, should feel and rue,\nThough I were not, fiend-wrath that shall not end,\nDescending on his head who foully slew.\n[Re-enter Apollo from the inner shrine.\nAPOLLO\nOut! I command you. Out from this my home—\nHaste, tarry not! Out from the mystic shrine,\nLest thy lot be to take into thy breast\nThe winged bright dart that from my golden string\nSpeeds hissing as a snake,—lest, pierced and thrilled\nWith agony, thou shouldst spew forth again\nBlack frothy heart’s-blood, drawn from mortal men,\nBelching the gory clots sucked forth from wounds.\nThese be no halls where such as you can prowl—\nGo where men lay on men the doom of blood,\nHeads lopped from necks, eyes from their spheres plucked out,\nHacked flesh, the flower of youthful seed crushed out,\nFeet hewn away, and hands, and death beneath\nThe smiting stone, low moans and piteous\nOf men impaled—Hark, hear ye for what feast\nYe hanker ever, and the loathing gods\nDo spit upon your craving? Lo, your shape\nIs all too fitted to your greed; the cave\nWhere lurks some lion, lapping gore, were home\nMore meet for you. Avaunt from sacred shrines,\nNor bring pollution by your touch on all\nThat nears you. Hence! and roam unshepherded—\nNo god there is to tend such herd as you.\nCHORUS\nO king Apollo, in our turn hear us.\nThou hast’not only part in these ill things,\nBut art chief cause and doer of the same.\nAPOLLO\nHow? stretch thy speech to tell this, and have done.\nCHORUS\nThine oracle bade this man slay his mother.\nAPOLLO\nI bade him quit his sire’s death,—wherefore not?\nCHORUS\nThen didst thou aid and guard red-handed crime.\nAPOLLO\nYea, and I bade him to this temple flee.\nCHORUS\nAnd yet forsooth dost chide us following him!\nAPOLLO\nAy—not for you it is, to near this fane.\nCHORUS\nYet is such office ours, imposed by fate.\nAPOLLO\nWhat office? vaunt the thing ye deem so fair.\nCHORUS\nFrom home to home we chase the matricide.\nAPOLLO\nWhat? to avenge a wife who slays her lord?\nCHORUS\nThat is not blood outpoured by kindred hands.\nAPOLLO\nHow darkly ye dishonour and annul\nThe troth to which the high accomplishers,\nHera and Zeus, do honour. Yea, and thus\nIs Aphrodite to dishonour cast,\nThe queen of rapture unto mortal men.\nKnow, that above the marriage-bed ordained\nFor man and woman standeth Right as guard,\nEnhancing sanctity of troth-plight sworn;\nTherefore, if thou art placable to those\nWho have their consort slain, nor will’st to turn\nOn them the eye of wrath, unjust art thou\nIn hounding to his doom the man who slew\nHis mother. Lo, I know thee full of wrath\nAgainst one deed, but all too placable\nUnto the other, minishing the crime.\nBut in this cause shall Pallas guard the right.\nCHORUS\nDeem not my quest shall ever quit that man.\nAPOLLO\nFollow then, make thee double toil in vain!\nCHORUS\nThink not by speech mine office to curtail.\nAPOLLO\nNone hast thou, that I would accept of thee!\nCHORUS\nYea, high thine honour by the throne of Zeus:\nBut I, drawn on by scent of mother’s blood,\nSeek vengeance on this man and hound him down.\nAPOLLO\nBut I will stand beside him; ’tis for me\nTo guard my suppliant: gods and men alike\nDo dread the curse of such an one betrayed,\nAnd in me Fear and Will say Leave him not.\n[Exeunt omnes]",

    "content":"The scene changes to Athens. In the foreground, the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis; her statue stands in the centre; Orestes is seen clinging to it.\nORESTES\nLook on me, queen Athena; lo, I come\nBy Loxias’ behest; thou of thy grace\nReceive me, driven of avenging powers—\nNot now a red-hand slayer unannealed,\nBut with guilt fading, half-effaced, outworn\nOn many homes and paths of mortal men.\nFor to the limit of each land, each sea,\nI roamed, obedient to Apollo’s hest,\nAnd come at last, O Goddess, to thy fane,\nAnd clinging to thine image, bide my doom.\n[Enter the Chorus of Furies, questing like hounds\nCHORUS\nHo! clear is here the trace of him we seek:\nFollow the track of blood, the silent sign!\nLike to some hound that hunts a wounded fawn,\nWe snuff along the scent of dripping gore,\nAnd inwardly we pant, for many a day\nToiling in chase that shall fordo the man;\nFor o’er and o’er the wide land have I ranged,\nAnd o’er the wide sea, flying without wings,\nSwift as a sail I pressed upon his track,\nWho now hard by is crouching, well I wot,\nFor scent of mortal blood allures me here.\nFollow, seek him—round and round\nScent and snuff and scan the ground,\nLest unharmed he slip away,\nHe who did his mother slay!\nHist—he is there! See him his arms entwine\nAround the image of the maid divine—\nThus aided, for the deed he wrought\nUnto the judgment wills he to be brought.\nIt may not be! a mother’s blood, poured forth\nUpon the stainèd earth,\nNone gathers up: it lies—bear witness, Hell!—\nFor aye indelible!\nAnd thou who sheddest it shalt give thine own\nThat shedding to atone!\nYea, from thy living limbs I suck it out,\nRed, clotted, gout by gout,—\nA draught abhorred of men and gods; but I\nWill drain it, suck thee dry;\nYea, I will waste thee living, nerve and vein;\nYea, for thy mother slain,\nWill drag thee downward, there where thou shalt dree\nThe weird of agony!\nAnd thou and whatsoe’er of men hath sinned—\nHath wronged or God, or friend,\nOr parent,—learn ye how to all and each\nThe arm of doom can reach!\nSternly requiteth, in the world beneath,\nThe judgment-seat of Death;\nYea, Death, beholding every man’s endeavour\nRecordeth it for ever.\nORESTES\nI, schooled in many miseries, have learnt\nHow many refuges of cleansing shrines\nThere be; I know when law alloweth speech\nAnd when imposeth silence. Lo, I stand\nFixed now to speak, for he whose word is wise\nCommands the same. Look, how the stain of blood\nIs dull upon mine hand and wastes away,\nAnd laved and lost therewith is the deep curse\nOf matricide; for while the guilt was new,\n’Twas banished from me at Apollo’s hearth,\nAtoned and purified by death of swine.\nLong were my word if I should sum the tale,\nHow oft since then among my fellow-men\nI stood and brought no curse. Time cleanses all—\nTime, the coeval of all things that are.\nNow from pure lips, in words of omen fair,\nI call Athena, lady of this land,\nTo come, my champion: so, in aftertime,\nShe shall not fail of love and service leal,\nNot won by war, from me and from my land,\nAnd all the folk of Argos, vowed to her.\nNow, be she far away in Libyan land\nWhere flows from Triton’s lake her natal wave,—\nStand she with planted feet, or in some hour\nOf rest conceal them, champion of her friends\nWhere’er she be,—or whether o’er the plain\nPhlegraean she look forth, as warrior bold—\nI cry to her to come, where’er she be,\n(And she, as goddess, from afar can hear,)\nAnd aid and free me, set among my foes.\nCHORUS\nThee not Apollo nor Athena’s strength\nCan save from perishing, a castaway\nAmid the Lost, where no delight shall meet\nThy soul—a bloodless prey of nether powers,\nA shadow among shadows. Answerest thou\nNothing? dost cast away my words with scorn,\nThou, prey prepared and dedicate to me?\nNot as a victim slain upon the shrine,\nBut living shalt thou see thy flesh my food.\nHear now the binding chant that makes thee mine.\nWeave the weird dance,—behold the hour\nTo utter forth the chant of hell,\nOur sway among mankind to tell,\nThe guidance of our power.\nOf Justice are we ministers,\nAnd whosoe’er of men may stand\nLifting a pure unsullied hand,\nThat man no doom of ours incurs,\nAnd walks thro’ all his mortal path\nUntouched by woe, unharmed by wrath.\nBut if, as yonder man, he hath\nBlood on the hands he strives to hide,\nWe stand avengers at his side,\nDecreeing, Thou hast wronged the dead:\nWe are doom’s witnesses to thee.\nThe price of blood, his hands have shed,\nWe wring from him; in life, in death,\nHard at his side are we!\nNight, Mother Night, who brought me forth, a torment\nTo living men and dead,\nHear me, O hear! by Leto’s stripling son\nI am dishonourèd:\nHe hath ta’en from me him who cowers in refuge,\nTo me made consecrate,—\nA rightful victim, him who slew his mother.\nGiven o’er to me and fate.\nHear the hymn of hell,\nO’er the victim sounding,—\nChant of frenzy, chant of ill,\nSense and will confounding!\nRound the soul entwining\nWithout lute or lyre—\nSoul in madness pining,\nWasting as with fire!\nFate, all-pervading Fate, this service spun, commanding\nThat I should bide therein:\nWhosoe’er of mortals, made perverse and lawless,\nIs stained with blood of kin,\nBy his side are we, and hunt him ever onward,\nTill to the Silent Land,\nThe realm of death, he cometh; neither yonder\nIn freedom shall he stand.\nHear the hymn of hell,\nO’er the victim sounding,—\nChant of frenzy, chant of ill,\nSense and will confounding!\nRound the soul entwining\nWithout lute or lyre—\nSoul in madness pining,\nWasting as with fire!\nWhen from womb of Night we sprang, on us this labour\nWas laid and shall abide.\nGods immortal are ye, yet beware ye touch not\nThat which is our pride!\nNone may come beside us gathered round the blood feast—\nFor us no garments white\nGleam on a festal day; for us a darker fate is,\nAnother darker rite.\nThat is mine hour when falls an ancient line—\nWhen in the household’s heart\nThe god of blood doth slay by kindred hands,—\nThen do we bear our part:\nOn him who slays we sweep with chasing cry:\nThough he be triply strong,\nWe wear and waste him; blood atones for blood,\nNew pain for ancient wrong.\nI hold this task—’tis mine, and not another’s.\nThe very gods on high,\nThough they can silence and annul the prayers\nOf those who on us cry,\nThey may not strive with us who stand apart,\nA race by Zeus abhorred,\nBlood-boltered, held unworthy of the council\nAnd converse of Heaven’s lord.\nTherefore the more I leap upon my prey;\nUpon their head I bound;\nMy foot is hard; as one that trips a runner\nI cast them to the ground;\nYea, to the depth of doom intolerable;\nAnd they who erst were great,\nAnd upon earth held high their pride and glory,\nAre brought to low estate.\nIn underworld they waste and are diminished,\nThe while around them fleet\nDark wavings of my robes, and, subtly woven,\nThe paces of my feet.\nWho falls infatuate, he sees not, neither knows he\nThat we are at his side;\nSo closely round about him, darkly flitting,\nThe cloud of guilt doth glide.\nHeavily ’tis uttered, how around his hearthstone\nThe mirk of hell doth rise.\nStern and fixed the law is; we have hands t’achieve it,\nCunning to devise.\nQueens are we and mindful of our solemn vengeance.\nNot by tear or prayer\nShall a man avert it. In unhonoured darkness,\nFar from gods, we fare,\nLit unto our task with torch of sunless regions,\nAnd o’er a deadly way—\nDeadly to the living as to those who see not\nLife and light of day—\nHunt we and press onward. Who of mortals hearing\nDoth not quake for awe,\nHearing all that Fate thro’ hand of God hath given us\nFor ordinance and law?\nYea, this right to us, in dark abysm and backward\nOf ages it befel:\nNone shall wrong mine office, tho’ in nether regions\nAnd sunless dark I dwell.\n[Enter Athena from above.\nATHENA\nFar off I heard the clamour of your cry,\nAs by Scamander’s side I set my foot\nAsserting right upon the land given o’er\nTo me by those who o’er Achaia’s host\nHeld sway and leadership: no scanty part\nOf all they won by spear and sword, to me\nThey gave it, land and all that grew theron,\nAs chosen heirloom for my Theseus’ clan.\nThence summoned, sped I with a tireless foot,—\nHummed on the wind, instead of wings, the fold\nOf this mine aegis, by my feet propelled,\nAs, linked to mettled horses, speeds a car.\nAnd now, beholding here Earth’s nether brood,\nI fear it nought, yet are mine eyes amazed\nWith wonder. Who are ye? of all I ask,\nAnd of this stranger to my statue clinging.\nBut ye—your shape is like no human form,\nLike to no goddess whom the gods behold,\nLike to no shape which mortal women wear.\nYet to stand by and chide a monstrous form\nIs all unjust—from such words Right revolts.\nCHORUS\nO child of Zeus, one word shall tell thee all.\nWe are the children of eternal Night,\nAnd Furies in the underworld are called.\nATHENA\nI know your lineage now and eke your name.\nCHORUS\nYea, and eftsoons indeed my rights shalt know.\nATHENA\nFain would I learn them; speak them clearly forth.\nCHORUS\nWe chase from home the murderers of men.\nATHENA\nAnd where at last can he that slew make pause?\nCHORUS\nWhere this is law—All joy abandon here.\nATHENA\nSay, do ye bay this man to such a flight?\nCHORUS\nYea, for of choice he did his mother slay.\nATHENA\nUrged by no fear of other wrath and doom?\nCHORUS\nWhat spur can rightly goad to matricide?\nATHENA\nTwo stand to plead—one only have I heard.\nCHORUS\nHe will not swear nor challenge us to oath.\nATHENA\nThe form of justice, not its deed, thou willest.\nCHORUS\nProve thou that word; thou art not scant of skill.\nATHENA\nI say that oaths shall not enforce the wrong.\nCHORUS\nThen test the cause, judge and award the right.\nATHENA\nWill ye to me then this decision trust?\nCHORUS\nYea, reverencing true child of worthy sire.\nATHENA (to Orestes)\nO man unknown, make thou thy plea in turn.\nSpeak forth thy land, thy lineage, and thy woes;\nThen, if thou canst, avert this bitter blame—\nIf, as I deem, in confidence of right\nThou sittest hard beside my holy place,\nClasping this statue, as Ixion sat,\nA sacred suppliant for Zeus to cleanse,—\nTo all this answer me in words made plain.\nORESTES\nO queen Athena, first from thy last words\nWill I a great solicitude remove.\nNot one blood-guilty am I; no foul stain\nClings to thine image from my clinging hand;\nWhereof one potent proof I have to tell.\nLo, the law stands—The slayer shall not plead,\nTill by the hand of him who cleanses blood\nA suckling creature’s blood besprinkle him.\nLong since have I this expiation done,—\nIn many a home, slain beasts and running streams\nHave cleansed me.

    "content":"THE PERSIANS\nARGUMENT\nXerxes, son of Darius and of his wife Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, went forth against Hellas, to take vengeance upon those who had defeated his father at Marathon. But ill fortune befell the king and his army both by land and sea; neither did it avail him that he cast a bridge over the Hellespont and made a canal across the promontory of Mount Athos, and brought myriads of men, by land and sea, to subdue the Greeks. For in the strait between Athens and the island of Salamis the Persian ships were shattered and sunk or put to flight by those of Athens and Lacedaemon and Aegina and Corinth, and Xerxes went homewards on the way by which he had come, leaving his general Mardonius with three hundred thousand men to strive with the Greeks by land: but in the next year they were destroyed near Plataea in Boeotia, by the Lacedaemonians and Athenians and Tegeans. Such was the end of the army which Xerxes left behind him. But the king himself had reached the bridge over the Hellespont, and late and hardly and in sorry plight and with few companions came home unto the Palace of Susa.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nCHORUS OF PERSIAN ELDERS.\nATOSSA, WIDOW OF DARIUS AND MOTHER OF XERXES.\nA MESSENGER.\nTHE GHOST OF DARIUS.\nXERXES.\nThe Scene is laid at the Palace of Susa.\nCHORUS.\nAway unto the Grecian land\nHath passed the Persian armament:\nWe, by the monarch’s high command,\nWe are the warders true who stand,\nChosen, for honour and descent,\nTo watch the wealth of him who went—\nGuards of the gold, and faithful styled\nBy Xerxes, great Darius’ child!\nBut the king went nor comes again—\nAnd for that host, we saw depart\nArrayed in gold, my boding heart\nAches with a pulse of anxious pain,\nPresageful for its youthful king!\nNo scout, no steed, no battle-car\nComes speeding hitherward, to bring\nNews to our city from afar!\nErewhile they went, away, away,\nFrom Susa, from Ecbatana,\nFrom Kissa’s timeworn fortress grey,\nPassing to ravage and to war—\nSome upon steeds, on galleys some,\nSome in close files, they passed from home,\nAll upon warlike errand bent—\nAmistres, Artaphernes went,\nAstaspes, Megabazes high,\nLords of the Persian chivalry,\nMarshals who serve the great king’s word\nChieftains of all the mighty horde!\nHorsemen and bowmen streamed away,\nGrim in their aspect, fixed to slay,\nAnd resolute to face the fray!\nWith troops of horse, careering fast,\nMasistes, Artembáres passed:\nImaeus too, the bowman brave,\nSosthánes, Pharandákes, drave—\nAnd others the all-nursing wave\nOf Nilus to the battle gave;\nCame Susiskánes, warrior wild,\nAnd Pegastágon, Egypt’s child:\nThee, brave Arsámes! from afar\nDid holy Memphis launch to war;\nAnd Ariomardus, high in fame,\nFrom Thebes the immemorial came,\nAnd oarsmen skilled from Nilus’ fen,\nA countless crowd of warlike men:\nAnd next, the dainty Lydians went—\nSoft rulers of a continent—\nMitragathes and Arcteus bold\nIn twin command their ranks controlled,\nAnd Sardis town, that teems with gold,\nSent forth its squadrons to the war—\nHorse upon horse, and car on car,\nDouble and triple teams, they rolled,\nIn onset awful to behold.\nFrom Tmolus’ sacred hill there came\nThe native hordes to join the fray,\nAnd upon Hellas’ neck to lay\nThe yoke of slavery and shame;\nMardon and Tharubis were there,\nBright anvils for the foemen’s spear!\nThe Mysian dart-men sped to war,\nAnd the long crowd that onward rolled\nFrom Babylon enriched with gold—\nCaptains of ships and archers skilled\nTo speed the shaft, and those who wield\nThe scimitar;—the eastern band\nWho, by the great king’s high command,\nSwept to subdue the western land!\nGone are they, gone—ah, welladay!\nThe flower and pride of our array;\nAnd all the Eastland, from whose breast\nCame forth her bravest and her best,\nCraves longingly with boding dread—\nParents for sons, and brides new-wed\nFor absent lords, and, day by day,\nShudder with dread at their delay!\nEre now they have passed o’er the sea, the manifold host of the king—\nThey have gone forth to sack and to burn; ashore on the Westland they spring!\nWith cordage and rope they have bridged the sea-way of Helle, to pass\nO’er the strait that is named by thy name, O daughter of Athamas!\nThey have anchored their ships in the current, they have bridled the neck of the sea—\nThe Shepherd and Lord of the East hath bidden a roadway to be!\nFrom the land to the land they pass over, a herd at the high king’s best;\nSome by the way of the waves, and some o’er the planking have pressed.\nFor the king is a lord and a god: he was born of the golden seed\nThat erst upon Danae fell—his captains are strong at the need!\nAnd dark is the glare of his eyes, as eyes of a serpent blood-fed,\nAnd with manifold troops in his train and with manifold ships hath he sped—\nYea, sped with his Syrian cars: he leads on the lords of the bow\nTo meet with the men of the West, the spear-armed force of the foe!\nCan any make head and resist him, when he comes with the roll of a wave?\nNo barrier nor phalanx of might, no chief, be he ever so brave!\nFor stern is the onset of Persia, and gallant her children in fight.\nBut the guile of the god is deceitful, and who shall elude him by flight?\nAnd who is the lord of the leap, that can spring and alight and evade?\nFor Até deludes and allures, till round him the meshes are laid,\nAnd no man his doom can escape! it was writ in the rule of high Heaven,\nThat in tramp of the steeds and in crash of the charge the war-cry of Persia be given:\nThey have learned to behold the forbidden, the sacred enclosure of sea,\nWhere the waters are wide and in stress of the wind the billows roll hoary to lee!\nAnd their trust is in cable and cordage, too weak in the power of the blast,\nAnd frail are the links of the bridge whereby unto Hellas they passed.\nTherefore my gloom-wrapped heart is rent with sorrow\nFor what may hap to-morrow!\nAlack, for all the Persian armament—\nAlack, lest there be sent\nDread news of desolation, Susa’s land\nBereft, forlorn, unmanned—\nLest the grey Kissian fortress echo back\nThe wail, Alack, Alack!\nThe sound of women’s shriek, who wail and mourn,\nWith fine-spun raiment torn!\nThe charioteers went forth nor come again,\nAnd all the marching men\nEven as a swarm of bees have flown afar,\nDrawn by the king to war—\nCrossing the sea-bridge, linked from side to side,\nThat doth the waves divide:\nAnd the soft bridal couch of bygone years\nIs now bedewed with tears,\nEach princess, clad in garments delicate,\nWails for her widowed fate—\nAlas my gallant bridegroom, lost and gone,\nAnd I am left alone!\nBut now, ye warders of the state,\nHere, in this hall of old renown,\nBehoves that we deliberate\nIn counsel deep and wise debate,\nFor need is surely shown!\nHow fareth he, Darius’ child,\nThe Persian king, from Perseus styled?\nComes triumph to the eastern bow,\nOr hath the lance-point conquered now?\nEnter ATOSSA.\nSee, yonder comes the mother-queen,\nLight of our eyes, in godlike sheen,\nThe royal mother of the king!—\nFall we before her! well it were\nThat, all as one, we sue to her,\nAnd round her footsteps cling!\nQueen, among deep-girded Persian dames thou highest and most royal,\nHoary mother, thou, of Xerxes, and Darius’ wife of old!\nTo godlike sire, and godlike son, we bow us and are loyal—\nUnless, on us, an adverse tide of destiny has rolled!\nATOSSA.\nTherefore come I forth to you, from chambers decked and golden,\nWhere long ago Darius laid his head, with me beside,\nAnd my heart is torn with anguish, and with terror am I holden,\nAnd I plead unto your friendship and I bid you to my side.\nDarius, in the old time, by aid of some Immortal,\nRaised up the stately fabric, our wealth of long-ago:\nBut I tremble lest it totter down, and ruin porch and portal,\nAnd the whirling dust of downfall rise above its overthrow!\nTherefore a dread unspeakable within me never slumbers,\nSaying, Honour not the gauds of wealth if men have ceased to grow,\nNor deem that men, apart from wealth, can find their strength in numbers—\nWe shudder for our light and king, though we have gold enow!\nNo light there is, in any house, save presence of the master—\nSo runs the saw, ye aged men! and truth it says indeed—\nOn you I call, the wise and true, to ward us from disaster,\nFor all my hope is fixed on you, to prop us in our need!\nCHORUS.\nQueen-Mother of the Persian land, to thy commandment bowing,\nWhate’er thou wilt, in word or deed, we follow to fulfil—\nNot twice we need thine high behest, our faith and duty knowing,\nIn council and in act alike, thy loyal servants still!\nATOSSA.\nLong while by various visions of the night\nAm I beset, since to Ionian lands\nWith marshalled host my son went forth to war.\nYet never saw I presage so distinct\nAs in the night now passed.—Attend my tale!—\nA dream I had: two women nobly clad\nCame to my sight, one robed in Persian dress,\nThe other vested in the Dorian garb,\nAnd both right stately and more tall by far\nThan women of to-day, and beautiful\nBeyond disparagement, and sisters sprung\nBoth of one race, but, by their natal lot,\nOne born in Hellas, one in Eastern land.\nThese, as it seemed unto my watching eyes,\nRoused each the other to a mutual feud:\nThe which my son perceiving set himself\nTo check and soothe their struggle, and anon\nYoked them and set the collars on their necks;\nAnd one, the Ionian, proud in this array,\nPaced in high quietude, and lent her mouth,\nObedient, to the guidance of the rein.\nBut restively the other strove, and broke\nThe fittings of the car, and plunged away\nWith mouth un-bitted: o’er the broken yoke\nMy son was hurled, and lo! Darius stood\nIn lamentation o’er his fallen child.\nHim Xerxes saw, and rent his robe in grief.\nSuch was my vision of the night now past;\nBut when, arising, I had dipped my hand\nIn the fair lustral stream, I drew towards\nThe altar, in the act of sacrifice,\nHaving in mind to offer, as their due,\nThe sacred meal-cake to the averting powers,\nLords of the rite that banisheth ill dreams.\nWhen lo! I saw an eagle fleeing fast\nTo Phoebus’ shrine—O friends, I stayed my steps,\nToo scared to speak! for, close upon his flight,\nA little falcon dashed in winged pursuit,\nPlucking with claws the eagle’s head, while he\nCould only crouch and cower and yield himself.\nScared was I by that sight, and eke to you\nNo less a terror must it be to hear!\nFor mark this well—if Xerxes have prevailed,\nHe shall come back the wonder of the world:\nIf not, still none can call him to account—\nSo he but live, he liveth Persia’s King!\nCHORUS.\nQueen, it stands not with my purpose to abet these fears of thine,\nNor to speak with glazing comfort! nay, betake thee to the shrine!\nIf thy dream foretold disaster, sue to gods to bar its way,\nAnd, for thyself, son, state, and friends, to bring fair fate to-day.\nNext, unto Earth and to the Dead be due libation poured,\nAnd by thee let Darius’ soul be wistfully implored—\nI saw thee, lord, in last night’s dream, a phantom from the grave,\nI pray thee, lord, from earth beneath come forth to help and save!\nTo me and to thy son send up the bliss of triumph now,\nAnd hold the gloomy fates of ill, dim in the dark below!\nSuch be thy words! my inner heart good tidings doth foretell,\nAnd that fair fate will spring thereof, if wisdom guide us well.\nATOSSA.\nLoyal thou that first hast read this dream, this vision of the night,\nWith loyalty to me, the queen—be then thy presage right!\nAnd therefore, as thy bidding is, what time I pass within\nTo dedicate these offerings, new prayers I will begin,\nAlike to gods and the great dead who loved our lineage well.\nYet one more word—say, in what realm do the Athenians dwell?\nCHORUS.\nFar hence, even where, in evening land, goes down our Lord the Sun.\nATOSSA.\nSay, had my son so keen desire, that region to o’errun?\nCHORUS.\nYea—if she fell, the rest of Greece were subject to our sway!\nATOSSA.\nHath she so great predominance, such legions in array?\nCHORUS.\nAy—such a host as smote us sore upon an earlier day.\nATOSSA.\nAnd what hath she, besides her men? enow of wealth in store?\nCHORUS.\nA mine of treasure in the earth, a fount of silver ore!\nATOSSA.\nIs it in skill of bow and shaft that Athens’ men excel?\nCHORUS.\nNay, they bear bucklers in the fight, and thrust the spear-point well.\nATOSSA.\nAnd who is shepherd of their host and holds them in command?\nCHORUS.\nTo no man do they bow as slaves, nor own a master’s hand.\nATOSSA.\nHow should they bide our brunt of war, the East upon the West?\nCHORUS.\nThat could Darius’ valiant horde in days of yore attest!\nATOSSA.\nA boding word, to us who bore the men now far away!\nCHORUS.\nNay—as I deem, the very truth will dawn on us to-day.\nA Persian by his garb and speed, a courier draws anear—\nHe bringeth news, of good or ill, for Persia’s land to hear.\nEnter a MESSENGER.\nMESSENGER.\nO walls and towers of all the Asian realm,\nO Persian land, O treasure-house of gold!\nHow, by one stroke, down to destruction, down,\nHath sunk our pride, and all the flower of war\nThat once was Persia’s, lieth in the dust!\nWoe on the man who first announceth woe—\nYet must I all the tale of death unroll!\nHark to me, Persians! Persia’s host lies low.\nCHORUS.\nO ruin manifold, and woe, and fear!\nLet the wild tears run down, for the great doom is here!\nMESSENGER.\nThis blow hath fallen, to the utterance, And I, past hope, behold my safe return!\nCHORUS.\nToo long, alack, too long this life of mine,\nThat in mine age I see this sudden woe condign!\nMESSENGER.\nAs one who saw, by no loose rumour led,\nLords, I would tell what doom was dealt to us.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, how vainly have they striven!\nOur myriad hordes with shaft and bow\nWent from the Eastland, to lay low\nHellas, beloved of Heaven!\nMESSENGER.\nPiled with men dead, yea, miserably slain,\nIs every beach, each reef of Salamis!\nCHORUS.\nThou sayest sooth—ah well-a-day!\nBattered amid the waves, and torn,\nOn surges hither, thither, borne,\nDead bodies, bloodstained and forlorn,\nIn their long cloaks they toss and stray!\nMESSENGER.\nTheir bows availed not! all have perished, all,\nBy charging galleys crushed and whelmed in death.\nCHORUS.\nShriek out your sorrow’s wistful wail!\nTo their untimely doom they went;\nIll strove they, and to no avail,\nAnd minished is their armament!\nMESSENGER.\nOut on thee, hateful name of Salamis,\nOut upon Athens, mournful memory!\nCHORUS.\nWoe upon this day’s evil fame!\nThou, Athens, art our murderess;\nAlack, full many a Persian dame\nIs left forlorn and husbandless!\nATOSSA.\nMute have I been awhile, and overwrought\nAt this great sorrow, for it passeth speech,\nAnd passeth all desire to ask of it.\nYet if the gods send evils, men must bear.\n(To the MESSENGER)\nUnroll the record! stand composed and tell,\nAlthough thy heart be groaning inwardly,\nWho hath escaped, and, of our leaders, whom\nHave we to weep? what chieftains in the van\nStood, sank, and died and left us leaderless?\nMESSENGER.\nXerxes himself survives and sees the day.\nATOSSA.\nThen to my line thy word renews the dawn\nAnd golden dayspring after gloom of night!\nMESSENGER.\nBut the brave marshal of ten thousand horse,\nArtembares, is tossed and flung in death\nAlong the rugged rocks Silenian.\nAnd Dadaces no longer leads his troop,\nBut, smitten by the spear, from off the prow\nHath lightly leaped to death; and Tenagon,\nIn true descent a Bactrian nobly born,\nDrifts by the sea-lashed reefs of Salamis,\nThe isle of Ajax. Gone Lilaeus too,\nGone are Arsames and Argestes! all,\nAround the islet where the sea-doves breed,\nDashed their defeated heads on iron rocks;\nArcteus, who dwelt beside the founts of Nile,\nAdeues, Pheresseues, and with them\nPharnuchus, from one galley’s deck went down.\nMatallus, too, of Chrysa, lord and king\nOf myriad hordes, who led unto the fight\nThree times ten thousand swarthy cavaliers,\nFell, with his swarthy and abundant beard\nIncarnadined to red, a crimson stain\nOutrivalling the purple of the sea!\nThere Magian Arabus and Artames\nOf Bactra perished—taking up, alike,\nIn yonder stony land their long sojourn.\nAmistris too, and he whose strenuous spear\nWas foremost in the fight, Amphistreus fell,\nAnd gallant Ariomardus, by whose death\nBroods sorrow upon Sardis: Mysia mourns\nFor Seisames, and Tharubis lies low—\nCommander, he, of five times fifty ships,\nBorn in Lyrnessus: his heroic form\nIs low in death, ungraced with sepulchre.\nDead too is he, the lord of courage high,\nCilicia’s marshal, brave Syennesis,\nThan whom none dealt more carnage on the foe,\nNor perished by a more heroic end.\nSo fell the brave: so speak I of their doom,\nSumming in brief the fate of myriads!\nATOSSA.\nAh well-a-day! these crowning woes I hear,\nThe shame of Persia and her shrieks of dole!\nBut yet renew the tale, repeat thy words,\nTell o’er the count of those Hellenic ships,\nAnd how they ventured with their beakèd prows\nTo charge upon the Persian armament.\nMESSENGER.\nKnow, if mere count of ships could win the day,\nThe Persians had prevailed. The Greeks, in sooth,\nHad but three hundred galleys at the most,\nAnd other ten, select and separate.\nBut—I am witness—Xerxes held command\nOf full a thousand keels, and, those apart,\nTwo hundred more, and seven, for speed renowned!—\nSo stands the reckoning, and who shall dare\nTo say we Persians had the lesser host?\nATOSSA.\nNay, we were worsted by an unseen power\nWho swayed the balance downward to our doom!\nMESSENGER.\nIn ward of heaven doth Pallas’ city stand.\nATOSSA.\nHow then? is Athens yet inviolate?\nMESSENGER.\nWhile her men live, her bulwark standeth firm!\nATOSSA.\nSay, how began the struggle of the ships?\nWho first joined issue? did the Greeks attack,\nOr Xerxes, in his numbers confident?\nMESSENGER.\nO queen, our whole disaster thus befell,\nThrough intervention of some fiend or fate—\nI know not what—that had ill will to us.\nFrom the Athenian host some Greek came o’er,\nTo thy son Xerxes whispering this tale—\nOnce let the gloom of night have gathered in,\nThe Greeks will tarry not, but swiftly spring\nEach to his galley-bench, in furtive flight,\nSoftly contriving safety for their life.\nThy son believed the word and missed the craft\nOf that Greek foeman, and the spite of Heaven,\nAnd straight to all his captains gave this charge—\nAs soon as sunlight warms the ground no more,\nAnd gloom enwraps the sanctuary of sky,\nRange we our fleet in triple serried lines\nTo bar the passage from the seething strait,\nThis way and that: let other ships surround\nThe isle of Ajax, with this warning word—\nThat if the Greeks their jeopardy should scape\nBy wary craft, and win their ships a road.\nEach Persian captain shall his failure pay\nBy forfeit of his head. So spake the king,\nInspired at heart with over-confidence,\nUnwitting of the gods’ predestined will.\nThereon our crews, with no disordered haste,\nDid service to his bidding and purveyed\nThe meal of afternoon: each rower then\nOver the fitted rowlock looped his oar.\nThen, when the splendour of the sun had set,\nAnd night drew on, each master of the oar\nAnd each armed warrior straightway went aboard.\nForward the long ships moved, rank cheering rank,\nEach forward set upon its ordered course.\nAnd all night long the captains of the fleet\nKept their crews moving up and down the strait.\nSo the night waned, and not one Grecian ship\nMade effort to elude and slip away.\nBut as dawn came and with her coursers white\nShone in fair radiance over all the earth,\nFirst from the Grecian fleet rang out a cry,\nA song of onset! and the island crags\nRe-echoed to the shrill exulting sound.\nThen on us Eastern men amazement fell\nAnd fear in place of hope; for what we heard\nWas not a call to flight! the Greeks rang out\nTheir holy, resolute, exulting chant,\nLike men come forth to dare and do and die\nTheir trumpets pealed, and fire was in that sound,\nAnd with the dash of simultaneous oars\nReplying to the war-chant, on they came,\nSmiting the swirling brine, and in a trice\nThey flashed upon the vision of the foe!\nThe right wing first in orderly advance\nCame on, a steady column; following then,\nThe rest of their array moved out and on,\nAnd to our ears there came a burst of sound,\nA clamour manifold.—On, sons of Greece!\nOn, for your country’s freedom! strike to save\nWives, children, temples of ancestral gods,\nGraves of your fathers! now is all at stake.\nThen from our side swelled up the mingled din\nOf Persian tongues, and time brooked no delay—\nShip into ship drave hard its brazen beak\nWith speed of thought, a shattering blow! and first\nOne Grecian bark plunged straight, and sheared away\nBowsprit and stem of a Phoenician ship.\nAnd then each galley on some other’s prow\nCame crashing in. Awhile our stream of ships\nHeld onward, till within the narrowing creek\nOur jostling vessels were together driven,\nAnd none could aid another: each on each\nDrave hard their brazen beaks, or brake away\nThe oar-banks of each other, stem to stern,\nWhile the Greek galleys, with no lack of skill,\nHemmed them and battered in their sides, and soon\nThe hulls rolled over, and the sea was hid,\nCrowded with wrecks and butchery of men.\nNo beach nor reef but was with corpses strewn,\nAnd every keel of our barbarian host\nHurried to flee, in utter disarray.\nThereon the foe closed in upon the wrecks\nAnd hacked and hewed, with oars and splintered planks,\nAs fishermen hack tunnies or a cast\nOf netted dolphins, and the briny sea\nRang with the screams and shrieks of dying men,\nUntil the night’s dark aspect hid the scene.\nHad I a ten days’ time to sum that count\nOf carnage, ’twere too little! know this well—\nOne day ne’er saw such myriad forms of death!\nATOSSA.\nWoe on us, woe! disaster’s mighty sea\nHath burst on us and all the Persian realm!\nMESSENGER.\nBe well assured, the tale is but begun—\nThe further agony that on us fell\nDoth twice outweigh the sufferings I have told!\nATOSSA.\nNay, what disaster could be worse than this?\nSay on! what woe upon the army came,\nSwaying the scale to a yet further fall?\nMESSENGER.\nThe very flower and crown of Persia’s race,\nGallant of soul and glorious in descent,\nAnd highest held in trust before the king,\nLies shamefully and miserably slain.\nATOSSA.\nAlas for me and for this ruin, friends!\nDead, sayest thou? by what fate overthrown?\nMESSENGER.\nAn islet is there, fronting Salamis—\nStrait, and with evil anchorage: thereon\nPan treads the measure of the dance he loves\nAlong the sea-beach. Thither the king sent\nHis noblest, that, whene’er the Grecian foe\nShould ’scape, with shattered ships, unto the isle,\nWe might make easy prey of fugitives\nAnd slay them there, and from the washing tides\nRescue our friends. It fell out otherwise\nThan he divined, for when, by aid of Heaven,\nThe Hellenes held the victory on the sea,\nTheir sailors then and there begirt themselves\nWith brazen mail and bounded from their ships,\nAnd then enringed the islet, point by point,\nSo that our Persians in bewilderment\nKnew not which way to turn. On every side,\nBattered with stones, they fell, while arrows flew\nFrom many a string, and smote them to the death.\nThen, at the last, with simultaneous rush\nThe foe came bursting on us, hacked and hewed\nTo fragments all that miserable band,\nTill not a soul of them was left alive.\nThen Xerxes saw disaster’s depth, and shrieked,\nFrom where he sat on high, surveying all—\nA lofty eminence, beside the brine,\nWhence all his armament lay clear in view.\nHis robe he rent, with loud and bitter wail,\nAnd to his land-force swiftly gave command\nAnd fled, with shame beside him! Now, lament\nThat second woe, upon the first imposed!\nATOSSA.\nOut on thee, Fortune! thou hast foiled the hope\nAnd power of Persia: to this bitter end\nMy son went forth to wreak his great revenge\nOn famous Athens! all too few they seemed,\nOur men who died upon the Fennel-field!\nVengeance for them my son had mind to take,\nAnd drew on his own head these whelming woes.\nBut thou, say on! the ships that ’scaped from wreck—\nWhere didst thou leave them? make thy story clear.\nMESSENGER.\nThe captains of the ships that still survived\nFled in disorder, scudding down the wind,\nThe while our land-force on Boeotian soil\nFell into ruin, some beside the springs\nDropping before they drank, and some outworn,\nPursued, and panting all their life away.\nThe rest of us our way to Phocis won,\nAnd thence to Doris and the Melian gulf,\nWhere with soft stream Spercheus laves the soil.\nThence to the northward did Phthiotis’ plain,\nAnd some Thessalian fortress, lend us aid,\nFor famine-pinched we were, and many died\nOf drought and hunger’s twofold present scourge.\nThence to Magnesia came we, and the land\nWhere Macedonians dwell, and crossed the ford\nOf Axius, and Bolbe’s reedy fen,\nAnd mount Pangaeus, in Edonian land.\nThere, in the very night we came, the god\nBrought winter ere its time, from bank to bank\nFreezing the holy Strymon’s tide. Each man\nWho heretofore held lightly of the gods,\nNow crouched and proffered prayer to Earth and Heaven!\nThen, after many orisons performed,\nThe army ventured on the frozen ford:\nYet only those who crossed before the sun\nShed its warm rays, won to the farther side.\nFor soon the fervour of the glowing orb\nDid with its keen rays pierce the ice-bound stream,\nAnd men sank through and thrust each other down—\nBest was his lot whose breath was stifled first!\nBut all who struggled through and gained the bank,\nToilfully wending through the land of Thrace\nHave made their way, a sorry, scanted few,\nUnto this homeland. Let the city now\nLament and yearn for all the loved and lost.\nMy tale is truth, yet much untold remains\nOf ills that Heaven hath hurled upon our land.\nCHORUS.\nSpirit of Fate, too heavy were thy feet,\nThose ill to match! that sprang on Persia’s realm.\nATOSSA.\nWoe for the host, to wrack and ruin hurled!\nO warning of the night, prophetic dream!\nThou didst foreshadow clearly all the doom,\nWhile ye, old men, made light of woman’s fears!\nAh well—yet, as your divination ruled\nThe meaning of the sign, I hold it good,\nFirst, that I put up prayer unto the gods,\nAnd, after that, forth from my palace bring\nThe sacrificial cake, the offering due\nTo Earth and to the spirits of the dead.\nToo well I know it is a timeless rite\nOver a finished thing that cannot change!\nBut yet—I know not—there may come of it\nAlleviation for the after time.\nYou it beseems, in view of what hath happed,\nT’ advise with loyal hearts our loyal guards:\nAnd to my son—if, ere my coming forth,\nHe should draw hitherward—give comfort meet,\nEscort him to the palace in all state,\nLest to these woes he add another woe!\n[Exit ATOSSA.]\nCHORUS.\nZeus, lord and king! to death and nought\nOur countless host by thee is brought.\nDeep in the gloom of death, to-day,\nLie Susa and Ecbatana:\nHow many a maid in sorrow stands\nAnd rends her tire with tender hands!\nHow tears run down, in common pain\nAnd woeful mourning for the slain!\nO delicate in dole and grief,\nYe Persian women! past relief\nIs now your sorrow! to the war\nYour loved ones went and come no more!\nGone from you is your joy and pride—\nSevered the bridegroom from the bride—\nThe wedded couch luxurious\nIs widowed now, and all the house\nPines ever with insatiate sighs,\nAnd we stand here and bid arise,\nFor those who forth in ardour went\nAnd come not back, the loud lament!\nLand of the East, thou mournest for the host,\nBereft of all thy sons, alas the day!\nFor them whom Xerxes led hath Xerxes lost—\nXerxes who wrecked the fleet, and flung our hopes away!\nHow came it that Darius once controlled,\nAnd without scathe, the army of the bow,\nLoved by the folk of Susa, wise and bold?\nNow is the land-force lost, the shipmen sunk below!\nAh for the ships that bore them, woe is me!\nBore them to death and doom! the crashing prows\nOf fierce Ionian oarsmen swept the sea,\nAnd death was in their wake, and shipwreck murderous!\nLate, late and hardly—if true tales they tell—\nDid Xerxes flee along the wintry way\nAnd snows of Thrace—but ah, the first who fell\nLie by the rocks or float upon Cychrea’s bay!\nMourn, each and all! waft heavenward your cry,\nStung to the soul, bereaved, disconsolate!\nWail out your anguish, till it pierce the sky,\nIn shrieks of deep despair, ill-omened, desperate!\nThe dead are drifting, yea, are gnawed upon\nBy voiceless children of the stainless sea,\nOr battered by the surge! we mourn and groan\nFor husbands gone to death, for childless agony!\nAlas the aged men, who mourn to-day\nThe ruinous sorrows that the gods ordain!\nO’er the wide Asian land, the Persian sway\nCan force no tribute now, and can no rule sustain.\nYea, men will crouch no more to fallen power\nAnd kingship overthrown! the whole land o’er,\nMen speak the thing they will, and from this hour\nThe folk whom Xerxes ruled obey his word no more.\nThe yoke of force is broken from the neck—\nThe isle of Ajax and th’ encircling wave\nReek with a bloody crop of death and wreck\nOf Persia’s fallen power, that none can lift nor save!\nRe-enter ATOSSA, in mourning robes.\nATOSSA.\nFriends, whosoe’er is versed in human ills,\nKnoweth right well that when a wave of woe\nComes on a man, he sees in all things fear;\nWhile, in flood-tide of fortune, ’tis his mood\nTo take that fortune as unchangeable,\nWafting him ever forward. Mark me now—\nThe gods’ thwart purpose doth confront mine eyes,\nAnd all is terror to me; in mine ears\nThere sounds a cry, but not of triumph now—\nSo am I scared at heart by woe so great.\nTherefore I wend forth from the house anew,\nBorne in no car of state, nor robed in pride\nAs heretofore, but bringing, for the sire\nWho did beget my son, libations meet\nFor holy rites that shall appease the dead—\nThe sweet white milk, drawn from a spotless cow,\nThe oozing drop of golden honey, culled\nBy the flower-haunting bee, and therewithal\nPure draughts of water from a virgin spring;\nAnd lo! besides, the stainless effluence,\nBorn of the wild vine’s bosom, shining store\nTreasured to age, this bright and luscious wine.\nAnd eke the fragrant fruit upon the bough\nOf the grey olive-tree, which lives its life\nIn sprouting leafage, and the twining flowers,\nBright children of the earth’s fertility.\nBut you, O friends! above these offerings poured\nTo reconcile the dead, ring out your dirge\nTo summon up Darius from the shades,\nHimself a shade; and I will pour these draughts,\nWhich earth shall drink, unto the gods of hell.\nCHORUS.\nQueen, by the Persian land adored,\nBy thee be this libation poured,\nPassing to those who hold command\nOf dead men in the spirit-land!\nAnd we will sue, in solemn chant,\nThat gods who do escort the dead\nIn nether realms, our prayer may grant—\nBack to us be Darius led!\nO Earth, and Hermes, and the king\nOf Hades, our Darius bring!\nFor if, beyond the prayers we prayed,\nHe knoweth aught of help or aid,\nHe, he alone, in realms below,\nCan speak the limit of our woe!\nDoth he hear me, the king we adored, who is god among gods of the dead?\nDoth he hear me send out in my sorrow the pitiful, manifold cry,\nThe sobbing lament and appeal? is the voice of my suffering sped\nTo the realm of the shades? doth he hear me and pity my sorrowful sigh?\nO Earth, and ye Lords of the dead! release ye that spirit of might,\nWho in Susa the palace was born! let him rise up once more to the light!\nThere is none like him, none of all\nThat e’er were laid in Persian sepulchres!\nBorne forth he was to honoured burial,\nA royal heart! and followed by our tears.\nGod of the dead, O give him back to us,\nDarius, ruler glorious!\nHe never wasted us with reckless war—\nGod, counsellor, and king, beneath a happy star!\nAncient of days and king, awake and come—\nRise o’er the mounded tomb!\nRise, plant thy foot, with saffron sandal shod\nFather to us, and god!\nRise with thy diadem, O sire benign,\nUpon thy brow!\nList to the strange new sorrows of thy line,\nSire of a woeful son!\nA mist of fate and hell is round us now,\nAnd all the city’s flower to death is done!\nAlas, we wept thee once, and weep again!\nO Lord of lords, by recklessness twofold\nThe land is wasted of its men,\nAnd down to death are rolled\nWreckage of sail and oar,\nShips that are ships no more,\nAnd bodies of the slain!\nThe GHOST OF DARIUS rises.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nYe aged Persians, truest of the true,\nCoevals of the youth that once was mine,\nWhat troubleth now our city? harken, how\nIt moans and beats the breast and rends the plain!\nAnd I, beholding how my consort stood\nBeside my tomb, was moved with awe, and took\nThe gift of her libation graciously.\nBut ye are weeping by my sepulchre,\nAnd, shrilling forth a sad, evoking cry,\nSummon me mournfully, Arise, arise.\nNo light thing is it, to come back from death,\nFor, in good sooth, the gods of nether gloom\nAre quick to seize but late and loth to free!\nYet among them I dwell as one in power—\nAnd lo, I come! now speak, and speed your words,\nLest I be blamed for tarrying overlong!\nWhat new disaster broods o’er Persia’s realm?\nCHORUS.\nWith awe on thee I gaze,\nAnd, standing face to face,\nI tremble as I did in olden days!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay, but as I rose to earth again, obedient to your call,\nPrithee, tarry not in parley! be one word enough for all—\nSpeak and gaze on me unshrinking, neither let my face appal!\nCHORUS.\nI tremble to reveal,\nYet tremble to conceal\nThings hard for friends to feel!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay, but if the old-time terror on your spirit keeps its hold,\nSpeak thou, O royal lady who didst couch with me of old!\nStay thy weeping and lamenting and to me reveal the truth—\nSpeak! for man is born to sorrow; yea, the proverb sayeth sooth!\n’Tis the doom of mortal beings, if they live to see old age,\nTo suffer bale, by land and sea, through war and tempest’s rage.\nATOSSA.\nO thou whose blissful fate on earth all mortal weal excelled—\nWho, while the sunlight touched thine eyes, the lord of all wert held!\nA god to Persian men thou wert, in bliss and pride and fame—\nI hold thee blest too in thy death, or e’er the ruin came!\nAlas, Darius! one brief word must tell thee all the tale—\nThe Persian power is in the dust, gone down in blood and bale!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nSpeak—by what chance? did man rebel, or pestilence descend?\nATOSSA.\nNeither! by Athens’ fatal shores our army met its end.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWhich of my children led our host to Athens? speak and say.\nATOSSA.\nThe froward Xerxes, leaving all our realm to disarray.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWas it with army or with fleet on folly’s quest he went?\nATOSSA.\nWith both alike, a twofold front of double armament.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAnd how then did so large a host on foot pass o’er the sea?\nATOSSA.\nHe bridged the ford of Helle’s strait by artful carpentry.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHow? could his craft avail to span the torrent of that tide?\nATOSSA.\n’Tis sooth I say—some unknown power did fatal help provide!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas, that power in malice came, to his bewilderment!\nATOSSA.\nAlas, we see the end of all, the ruin on us sent.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nSpeak, tell me how they fared therein, that thus ye mourn and weep?\nATOSSA.\nDisaster to the army came, through ruin on the deep!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nIs all undone? hath all the folk gone down before the foe?\nATOSSA.\nYea, hark to Susa’s mourning cry for warriors laid low!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas for all our gallant aids, our Persia’s help and pride!\nATOSSA.\nAy! old with young, the Bactrian force hath perished at our side!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas, my son! what gallant youths hath he sent down to death!\nATOSSA.\nAlone, or with a scanty guard—for so the rumour saith—\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHe came—but how, and to what end? doth aught of hope remain?\nATOSSA.\nWith joy he reached the bridge that spanned the Hellespontine main.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHow? is he safe, in Persian land? speak soothly, yea or nay!\nATOSSA.\nClear and more clear the rumour comes, for no man to gainsay.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWoe for the oracle fulfilled, the presage of the war\nLaunched on my son, by will of Zeus! I deemed our doom afar\nIn lap of time; but, if a king push forward to his fate,\nThe god himself allures to death that man infatuate!\nSo now the very fount of woe streams out on those I loved,\nAnd mine own son, unwisely bold, the truth hereof hath proved!\nHe sought to shackle and control the Hellespontine wave,\nThat rushes from the Bosphorus, with fetters of a slave!—\nTo curb and bridge, with welded links, the streaming water-way,\nAnd guide across the passage broad his manifold array!\nAh, folly void of counsel! he deemed that mortal wight\nCould thwart the will of Heaven itself and curb Poseidon’s might!\nWas it not madness? much I fear lest all my wealth and store\nPass from my treasure-house, to be the snatcher’s prize once more!\nATOSSA.\nSuch is the lesson, ah, too late! to eager Xerxes taught—\nTrusting random counsellors and hare-brained men of nought,\nWho said Darius mighty wealth and fame to us did bring,\nBut thou art nought, a blunted spear, a palace-keeping king!\nUnto those sorry counsellors a ready ear he lent,\nAnd led away to Hellas’ shore his fated armament.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nTherefore through them hath come calamity\nMost huge and past forgetting; nor of old\nDid ever such extermination fall\nUpon the city Susa. Long ago\nZeus in his power this privilege bestowed,\nThat with a guiding sceptre one sole man\nShould rule this Asian land of flock and herd.\nOver the folk a Mede, Astyages,\nDid grasp the power: then Cyaxares ruled\nIn his sire’s place, and held the sway aright,\nSteering his state with watchful wariness.\nThird in succession, Cyrus, blest of Heaven,\nHeld rule and ’stablished peace for all his clan:\nLydian and Phrygian won he to his sway,\nAnd wide Ionia to his yoke constrained,\nFor the god favoured his discretion sage.\nFourth in the dynasty was Cyrus’ son,\nAnd fifth was Mardus, scandal of his land\nAnd ancient lineage. Him Artaphrenes,\nHardy of heart, within his palace slew,\nAided by loyal plotters, set for this.\nAnd I too gained the lot for which I craved,\nAnd oftentimes led out a goodly host,\nYet never brought disaster such as this\nUpon the city. But my son is young\nAnd reckless in his youth, and heedeth not\nThe warnings of my mouth. Mark this, my friends,\nBorn with my birth, coeval with mine age—\nNot all we kings who held successive rule\nHave wrought, combined, such ruin as my son!\nCHORUS.\nHow then, O King Darius? whitherward\nDost thou direct thy warning? from this plight\nHow can we Persians fare towards hope again?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nBy nevermore assailing Grecian lands,\nEven tho’ our Median force be double theirs—\nFor the land’s self protects its denizens.\nCHORUS.\nHow meanest thou? by what defensive power?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nShe wastes by famine a too countless foe.\nCHORUS.\nBut we will bring a host more skilled than huge.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWhy, e’en that army, camped in Hellas still,\nShall never win again to home and weal!\nCHORUS.\nHow say’st thou? will not all the Asian host\nPass back from Europe over Helle’s ford?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay—scarce a tithe of all those myriads,\nIf man may trust the oracles of Heaven\nWhen he beholds the things already wrought,\nNot false with true, but true with no word false\nIf what I trow be truth, my son has left\nA chosen rear-guard of our host, in whom\nHe trusts, now, with a random confidence!\nThey tarry where Asopus laves the ground\nWith rills that softly bless Boeotia’s plain—\nThere is it fated for them to endure\nThe very crown of misery and doom,\nRequital for their god-forgetting pride!\nFor why? they raided Hellas, had the heart\nTo wrong the images of holy gods,\nAnd give the shrines and temples to the flame!\nDefaced and dashed from sight the altars fell,\nAnd each god’s image, from its pedestal\nThrust and flung down, in dim confusion lies!\nTherefore, for outrage vile, a doom as dark\nThey suffer, and yet more shall undergo—\nThey touch no bottom in the swamp of doom,\nBut round them rises, bubbling up, the ooze!\nSo deep shall lie the gory clotted mass\nOf corpses by the Dorian spear transfixed\nUpon Plataea’s field! yea, piles of slain\nTo the third generation shall attest\nBy silent eloquence to those that see—\nLet not a mortal vaunt him overmuch.\nFor pride grows rankly, and to ripeness brings\nThe curse of fate, and reaps, for harvest, tears!\nTherefore when ye behold, for deeds like these,\nSuch stern requital paid, remember then\nAthens and Hellas. Let no mortal wight,\nHolding too lightly of his present weal\nAnd passionate for more, cast down and spill\nThe mighty cup of his prosperity!\nDoubt not that over-proud and haughty souls\nZeus lours in wrath, exacting the account.\nTherefore, with wary warning, school my son,\nThough he be lessoned by the gods already,\nTo curb the vaunting that affronts high Heaven!\nAnd thou, O venerable Mother-queen,\nBeloved of Xerxes, to the palace pass\nAnd take therefrom such raiment as befits\nThy son, and go to meet him: for his garb\nIn this extremity of grief hangs rent\nAround his body, woefully unstitched,\nMere tattered fragments of once royal robes!\nGo thou to him, speak soft and soothing words—\nThee, and none other, will he bear to hear,\nAs well I know. But I must pass away\nFrom earth above, unto the nether gloom;\nTherefore, old men, take my farewell, and clasp,\nEven amid the ruin of this time,\nUnto your souls the pleasure of the day,\nFor dead men have no profit of their gold!\n[The GHOST OF DARIUS sinks.]\nCHORUS.\nAlas, I thrill with pain for Persia’s woes—\nMany fulfilled, and others hard at hand!\nATOSSA.\nO spirit of the race, what sorrows crowd\nUpon me! and this anguish stings me worst,\nThat round my royal son’s dishonoured form\nHang rags and tatters, degradation deep!\nI will away, and, bringing from within\nA seemly royal robe, will straightway strive\nTo meet and greet my son: foul scorn it were\nTo leave our dearest in his hour of shame.\n[Exit ATOSSA.]\nCHORUS.\nAh glorious and goodly they were, the life and the lot that we gained,\nThe cities we held in our hand when the monarch invincible reigned,\nThe king that was good to his realm, sufficing, fulfilled of his sway,\nA lord that was peer of the gods, the pride of the bygone day!\nThen could we show to the skies great hosts and a glorious name,\nAnd laws that were stable in might; as towers they guarded our fame!\nThere without woe or disaster we came from the foe and the fight,\nIn triumph, enriched with the spoil, to the land and the city’s delight.\nWhat towns ere the Halys he passed! what towns ere he came to the West,\nTo the main and the isles of the Strymon, and the Thracian region possess’d!\nAnd those that stand back from the main, enringed by their fortified wall,\nGave o’er to Darius, the king, the sceptre and sway over all!\nThose too by the channel of Helle, where southward it broadens and glides,\nBy the inlets, Propontis! of thee, and the strait of the Pontic tides,\nAnd the isles that lie fronting our sea-board, and the Eastland looks on each one,\nLesbo and Chios and Paros, and Samos with olive-trees grown,\nAnd Naxos, and Myconos’ rock, and Tenos with Andros hard by,\nAnd isles that in midmost Aegean, aloof from the continent, lie—\nAnd Lemnos and Icaros’ hold—all these to his sceptre were bowed,\nAnd Cnidos and neighbouring Rhodes, and Soli, and Paphos the proud,\nAnd Cyprian Salamis, name-child of her who hath wrought us this wrong!\nYea, and all the Ionian tract, where the Greek-born inhabitants throng,\nAnd the cities are teeming with gold—Darius was lord of them all,\nAnd, great by his wisdom, he ruled, and ever there came to his call,\nIn stalwart array and unfailing, the warrior chiefs of our land,\nAnd mingled allies from the tribes who bowed to his conquering hand!\nBut now there are none to gainsay that the gods are against us; we lie\nSubdued in the havoc of wreck, and whelmed by the wrath of the sky!\nEnter XERXES in disarray.\nXERXES.\nAlas the day, that I should fall\nInto this grimmest fate of all,\nThis ruin doubly unforeseen!\nOn Persia’s land what power of Fate\nDescends, what louring gloom of hate?\nHow shall I bear my teen?\nMy limbs are loosened where they stand,\nWhen I behold this aged band—\nOh God! I would that I too, I,\nAmong the men who went to die,\nWere whelmed in earth by Fate’s command!\nCHORUS.\nAh welladay, my King! ah woe\nFor all our heroes’ overthrow—\nFor all the gallant host’s array,\nFor Persia’s honour, pass’d away,\nFor glory and heroic sway\nMown down by Fortune’s hand to-day!\nHark, how the kingdom makes its moan,\nFor youthful valour lost and gone,\nBy Xerxes shattered and undone!\nHe, he hath crammed the maw of hell\nWith bowmen brave, who nobly fell,\nTheir country’s mighty armament,\nTen thousand heroes deathward sent!\nAlas, for all the valiant band,\nO king and lord! thine Asian land\nDown, down upon its knee is bent!\nXERXES.\nAlas, a lamentable sound,\nA cry of ruth! for I am found\nA curse to land and lineage,\nWith none my sorrow to assuage!\nCHORUS.\nAlas, a death-song desolate\nI send forth, for thy home-coming!\nA scream, a dirge for woe and fate,\nSuch as the Asian mourners sing,\nA sorry and ill-omened tale\nOf tears and shrieks and Eastern wail!\nXERXES.\nAy, launch the woeful sorrow’s cry,\nThe harsh, discordant melody,\nFor lo, the power, we held for sure,\nHath turned to my discomfiture!\nCHORUS.\nYea, dirges, dirges manifold\nWill I send forth, for warriors bold,\nFor the sea-sorrow of our host!\nThe city mourns, and I must wail\nWith plashing tears our sorrow’s tale,\nLamenting for the loved and lost!\nXERXES.\nAlas, the god of war, who sways\nThe scales of fight in diverse ways,\nGives glory to Ionia!\nIonian ships, in fenced array,\nHave reaped their harvest in the bay,\nA darkling harvest-field of Fate,\nA sea, a shore, of doom and hate!\nCHORUS.\nCry out, and learn the tale of woe!\nWhere are thy comrades? where the band\nWho stood beside thee, hand in hand,\nA little while ago?\nWhere now hath Pharandákes gone,\nWhere Psammis, and where Pelagon?\nWhere now is brave Agdabatas,\nAnd Susas too, and Datamas?\nHath Susiscanes past away,\nThe chieftain of Ecbatana?\nXERXES.\nI left them, mangled castaways,\nFlung from their Tyrian deck, and tossed\nOn Salaminian water-ways,\nFrom surging tides to rocky coast!\nCHORUS.\nAlack, and is Pharnuchus slain,\nAnd Ariomardus, brave in vain?\nWhere is Seualces’ heart of fire?\nLilaeus, child of noble sire?\nAre Tharubis and Memphis sped?\nHystaechmas, Artembáres dead?\nAnd where is brave Masistes, where?\nSum up death’s count, that I may hear!\nXERXES.\nAlas, alas, they came, their eyes surveyed\nAncestral Athens on that fatal day.\nThen with a rending struggle were they laid\nUpon the land, and gasped their life away!\nCHORUS.\nAnd Batanochus’ child, Alpistus great,\nSurnamed the Eye of State—\nSaw you and left you him who once of old\nTen thousand thousand fighting-men enrolled?\nHis sire was child of Sesamas, and he\nFrom Megabates sprang. Ah, woe is me,\nThou king of evil fate!\nHast thou lost Parthus, lost Oebares great?\nAlas, the sorrow! blow succeedeth blow\nOn Persia’s pride; thou tellest woe on woe!\nXERXES.\nBitter indeed the pang for comrades slain,\nThe brave and bold! thou strikest to my soul\nPain, pain beyond forgetting, hateful pain.\nMy inner spirit sobs and sighs with dole!\nCHORUS.\nAnother yet we yearn to see,\nAnd see not! ah, thy chivalry,\nXanthis, thou chief of Mardian men\nCountless! and thou, Anchares bright,\nAnd ye, whose cars controlled the fight,\nArsaces and Diaixis wight,\nKegdadatas, Lythimnas dear,\nAnd Tolmus, greedy of the spear!\nI stand bereft! not in thy train\nCome they, as erst! ah, ne’er again\nShall they return unto our eyes,\nCar-borne, ’neath silken canopies!\nXERXES.\nYea, gone are they who mustered once the host!\nCHORUS.\nYea, yea, forgotten, lost!\nXERXES.\nAlas, the woe and cost!\nCHORUS.\nAlas, ye heavenly powers!\nYe wrought a sorrow past belief,\nA woe, of woes the chief!\nWith aspect stern, upon us Ate looms!\nXERXES.\nSmitten are we—time tells no heavier blow!\nCHORUS.\nSmitten! the doom is plain!\nXERXES.\nCurse upon curse and pang on pang we know!\nCHORUS.\nWith the Ionian power\nWe clashed, in evil hour!\nWoe falls on Persia’s race, yea, woe again, again!\nXERXES.\nYea, smitten am I, and my host is all to ruin hurled!\nCHORUS.\nYea verily—in mighty wreck hath sunk the Persian world!\nXERXES.\n(holding up a torn robe and a quiver)\nSee you this tattered rag of pride?\nCHORUS.\nI see it, welladay!\nXERXES.\nSee you this quiver?\nCHORUS.\nSay, hath aught survived and ’scaped the fray?\nXERXES.\nA store for darts it was, erewhile!\nCHORUS.\nRemain but two or three!\nXERXES.\nNo aid is left!\nCHORUS.\nIonian folk such darts, unfearing, see!\nXERXES.\nRight resolute they are!

    "content":"ANTIGONE\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nAntigone, daughter of Oedipus, the late king of Thebes, in defiance of Creon who rules in his stead, resolves to bury her brother Polyneices, slain in his attack on Thebes. She is caught in the act by Creon’s watchmen and brought before the king. She justifies her action, asserting that she was bound to obey the eternal laws of right and wrong in spite of any human ordinance. Creon, unrelenting, condemns her to be immured in a rock-hewn chamber. His son Haemon, to whom Antigone is betrothed, pleads in vain for her life and threatens to die with her. Warned by the seer Teiresias Creon repents him and hurries to release Antigone from her rocky prison. But he is too late: he finds lying side by side Antigone who had hanged herself and Haemon who also has perished by his own hand. Returning to the palace he sees within the dead body of his queen who on learning of her son’s death has stabbed herself to the heart.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE—daughters of Oedipus and sisters of Polyneices and Eteocles.\nCREON, King of Thebes.\nHAEMON, Son of Creon, betrothed to Antigone.\nEURYDICE, wife of Creon.\nTEIRESIAS, the prophet.\nCHORUS, of Theban elders.\nA WATCHMAN\nA MESSENGER\nA SECOND MESSENGER\nANTIGONE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE before the Palace gates.\nANTIGONE.\nIsmene, sister of my blood and heart,\nSee’st thou how Zeus would in our lives fulfill\nThe weird of Oedipus, a world of woes!\nFor what of pain, affliction, outrage, shame,\nIs lacking in our fortunes, thine and mine?\nAnd now this proclamation of today\nMade by our Captain-General to the State,\nWhat can its purport be? Didst hear and heed,\nOr art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?\nISMENE.\nTo me, Antigone, no word of friends\nHas come, or glad or grievous, since we twain\nWere reft of our two brethren in one day\nBy double fratricide; and since i’ the night\nOur Argive leaguers fled, no later news\nHas reached me, to inspirit or deject.\nANTIGONE.\nI know ’twas so, and therefore summoned thee\nBeyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.\nISMENE.\nWhat is it? Some dark secret stirs thy breast.\nANTIGONE.\nWhat but the thought of our two brothers dead,\nThe one by Creon graced with funeral rites,\nThe other disappointed? Eteocles\nHe hath consigned to earth (as fame reports)\nWith obsequies that use and wont ordain,\nSo gracing him among the dead below.\nBut Polyneices, a dishonored corse,\n(So by report the royal edict runs)\nNo man may bury him or make lament—\nMust leave him tombless and unwept, a feast\nFor kites to scent afar and swoop upon.\nSuch is the edict (if report speak true)\nOf Creon, our most noble Creon, aimed\nAt thee and me, aye me too; and anon\nHe will be here to promulgate, for such\nAs have not heard, his mandate; ’tis in sooth\nNo passing humor, for the edict says\nWhoe’er transgresses shall be stoned to death.\nSo stands it with us; now ’tis thine to show\nIf thou art worthy of thy blood or base.\nISMENE.\nBut how, my rash, fond sister, in such case\nCan I do anything to make or mar?\nANTIGONE.\nSay, wilt thou aid me and abet? Decide.\nISMENE.\nIn what bold venture? What is in thy thought?\nANTIGONE.\nLend me a hand to bear the corpse away.\nISMENE.\nWhat, bury him despite the interdict?\nANTIGONE.\nMy brother, and, though thou deny him, thine\nNo man shall say that I betrayed a brother.\nISMENE.\nWilt thou persist, though Creon has forbid?\nANTIGONE.\nWhat right has he to keep me from my own?\nISMENE.\nBethink thee, sister, of our father’s fate,\nAbhorred, dishonored, self-convinced of sin,\nBlinded, himself his executioner.\nThink of his mother-wife (ill sorted names)\nDone by a noose herself had twined to death\nAnd last, our hapless brethren in one day,\nBoth in a mutual destiny involved,\nSelf-slaughtered, both the slayer and the slain.\nBethink thee, sister, we are left alone;\nShall we not perish wretchedest of all,\nIf in defiance of the law we cross\nA monarch’s will?—weak women, think of that,\nNot framed by nature to contend with men.\nRemember this too that the stronger rules;\nWe must obey his orders, these or worse.\nTherefore I plead compulsion and entreat\nThe dead to pardon. I perforce obey\nThe powers that be. ’Tis foolishness, I ween,\nTo overstep in aught the golden mean.\nANTIGONE.\nI urge no more; nay, wert thou willing still,\nI would not welcome such a fellowship.\nGo thine own way; myself will bury him.\nHow sweet to die in such employ, to rest,—\nSister and brother linked in love’s embrace—\nA sinless sinner, banned awhile on earth,\nBut by the dead commended; and with them\nI shall abide for ever. As for thee,\nScorn, if thou wilt, the eternal laws of Heaven.\nISMENE.\nI scorn them not, but to defy the State\nOr break her ordinance I have no skill.\nANTIGONE.\nA specious pretext. I will go alone\nTo lap my dearest brother in the grave.\nISMENE.\nMy poor, fond sister, how I fear for thee!\nANTIGONE.\nO waste no fears on me; look to thyself.\nISMENE.\nAt least let no man know of thine intent,\nBut keep it close and secret, as will I.\nANTIGONE.\nO tell it, sister; I shall hate thee more\nIf thou proclaim it not to all the town.\nISMENE.\nThou hast a fiery soul for numbing work.\nANTIGONE.\nI pleasure those whom I would liefest please.\nISMENE.\nIf thou succeed; but thou art doomed to fail.\nANTIGONE.\nWhen strength shall fail me, yes, but not before.\nISMENE.\nBut, if the venture’s hopeless, why essay?\nANTIGONE.\nSister, forbear, or I shall hate thee soon,\nAnd the dead man will hate thee too, with cause.\nSay I am mad and give my madness rein\nTo wreck itself; the worst that can befall\nIs but to die an honorable death.\nISMENE.\nHave thine own way then; ’tis a mad endeavor,\nYet to thy lovers thou art dear as ever.\n[Exeunt]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nSunbeam, of all that ever dawn upon\nOur seven-gated Thebes the brightest ray,\nO eye of golden day,\nHow fair thy light o’er Dirce’s fountain shone,\nSpeeding upon their headlong homeward course,\nFar quicker than they came, the Argive force;\nPutting to flight\nThe argent shields, the host with scutcheons white.\nAgainst our land the proud invader came\nTo vindicate fell Polyneices’ claim.\nLike to an eagle swooping low,\nOn pinions white as new fall’n snow.\nWith clanging scream, a horsetail plume his crest,\nThe aspiring lord of Argos onward pressed.\n(Ant. 1)\nHovering around our city walls he waits,\nHis spearmen raven at our seven gates.\nBut ere a torch our crown of towers could burn,\nEre they had tasted of our blood, they turn\nForced by the Dragon; in their rear\nThe din of Ares panic-struck they hear.\nFor Zeus who hates the braggart’s boast\nBeheld that gold-bespangled host;\nAs at the goal the paean they upraise,\nHe struck them with his forked lightning blaze.\n(Str. 2)\nTo earthy from earth rebounding, down he crashed;\nThe fire-brand from his impious hand was dashed,\nAs like a Bacchic reveler on he came,\nOutbreathing hate and flame,\nAnd tottered. Elsewhere in the field,\nHere, there, great Area like a war-horse wheeled;\nBeneath his car down thrust\nOur foemen bit the dust.\nSeven captains at our seven gates\nThundered; for each a champion waits,\nEach left behind his armor bright,\nTrophy for Zeus who turns the fight;\nSave two alone, that ill-starred pair\nOne mother to one father bare,\nWho lance in rest, one ’gainst the other\nDrave, and both perished, brother slain by brother.\n(Ant. 2)\nNow Victory to Thebes returns again\nAnd smiles upon her chariot-circled plain.\nNow let feast and festal should\nMemories of war blot out.\nLet us to the temples throng,\nDance and sing the live night long.\nGod of Thebes, lead thou the round.\nBacchus, shaker of the ground!\nLet us end our revels here;\nLo! Creon our new lord draws near,\nCrowned by this strange chance, our king.\nWhat, I marvel, pondering?\nWhy this summons? Wherefore call\nUs, his elders, one and all,\nBidding us with him debate,\nOn some grave concern of State?\n[Enter CREON]\nCREON.\nElders, the gods have righted one again\nOur storm-tossed ship of state, now safe in port.\nBut you by special summons I convened\nAs my most trusted councilors; first, because\nI knew you loyal to Laius of old;\nAgain, when Oedipus restored our State,\nBoth while he ruled and when his rule was o’er,\nYe still were constant to the royal line.\nNow that his two sons perished in one day,\nBrother by brother murderously slain,\nBy right of kinship to the Princes dead,\nI claim and hold the throne and sovereignty.\nYet ’tis no easy matter to discern\nThe temper of a man, his mind and will,\nTill he be proved by exercise of power;\nAnd in my case, if one who reigns supreme\nSwerve from the highest policy, tongue-tied\nBy fear of consequence, that man I hold,\nAnd ever held, the basest of the base.\nAnd I contemn the man who sets his friend\nBefore his country. For myself, I call\nTo witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,\nIf I perceive some mischievous design\nTo sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;\nNor would I reckon as my private friend\nA public foe, well knowing that the State\nIs the good ship that holds our fortunes all:\nFarewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.\nSuch is the policy by which I seek\nTo serve the Commons and conformably\nI have proclaimed an edict as concerns\nThe sons of Oedipus; Eteocles\nWho in his country’s battle fought and fell,\nThe foremost champion—duly bury him\nWith all observances and ceremonies\nThat are the guerdon of the heroic dead.\nBut for the miscreant exile who returned\nMinded in flames and ashes to blot out\nHis father’s city and his father’s gods,\nAnd glut his vengeance with his kinsmen’s blood,\nOr drag them captive at his chariot wheels—\nFor Polyneices ’tis ordained that none\nShall give him burial or make mourn for him,\nBut leave his corpse unburied, to be meat\nFor dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.\nSo am I purposed; never by my will\nShall miscreants take precedence of true men,\nBut all good patriots, alive or dead,\nShall be by me preferred and honored.\nCHORUS.\nSon of Menoeceus, thus thou will’st to deal\nWith him who loathed and him who loved our State.\nThy word is law; thou canst dispose of us\nThe living, as thou will’st, as of the dead.\nCREON.\nSee then ye execute what I ordain.\nCHORUS.\nOn younger shoulders lay this grievous charge.\nCREON.\nFear not, I’ve posted guards to watch the corpse.\nCHORUS.\nWhat further duty would’st thou lay on us?\nCREON.\nNot to connive at disobedience.\nCHORUS.\nNo man is mad enough to court his death.\nCREON.\nThe penalty is death: yet hope of gain\nHath lured men to their ruin oftentimes.\n[Enter GUARD]\nGUARD.\nMy lord, I will not make pretense to pant\nAnd puff as some light-footed messenger.\nIn sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought\nMade many a halt and turned and turned again;\nFor conscience plied her spur and curb by turns.\n“Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?”\nShe whispered. Then again, “If Creon learn\nThis from another, thou wilt rue it worse.”\nThus leisurely I hastened on my road;\nMuch thought extends a furlong to a league.\nBut in the end the forward voice prevailed,\nTo face thee. I will speak though I say nothing.\nFor plucking courage from despair methought,\n‘Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.’\nCREON.\nWhat is thy news? Why this despondency?\nGUARD.\nLet me premise a word about myself?\nI neither did the deed nor saw it done,\nNor were it just that I should come to harm.\nCREON.\nThou art good at parry, and canst fence about\nSome matter of grave import, as is plain.\nGUARD.\nThe bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.\nCREON.\nThen, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.\nGUARD.\nWell, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone\nE’en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,\nPerformed the proper ritual—and was gone.\nCREON.\nWhat say’st thou? Who hath dared to do this thing?\nGUARD.\nI cannot tell, for there was ne’er a trace\nOf pick or mattock—hard unbroken ground,\nWithout a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,\nNo sign that human hands had been at work.\nWhen the first sentry of the morning watch\nGave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.\nThe corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,\nBut strewn with dust, as if by one who sought\nTo avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:\nOf hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.\nThereat arose an angry war of words;\nGuard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,\nFor none was there to part us, each in turn\nSuspected, but the guilt brought home to none,\nFrom lack of evidence. We challenged each\nThe ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,\nOr pass through fire, affirming on our oath\nOur innocence—we neither did the deed\nOurselves, nor know who did or compassed it.\nOur quest was at a standstill, when one spake\nAnd bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,\nFor there was no gainsaying him nor way\nTo escape perdition: Yeareboundtotell\nTheKing,yecannothideit; so he spake.\nAnd he convinced us all; so lots were cast,\nAnd I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.\nSo here I am unwilling and withal\nUnwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.\nCHORUS.\nI had misgivings from the first, my liege,\nOf something more than natural at work.\nCREON.\nO cease, you vex me with your babblement;\nI am like to think you dote in your old age.\nIs it not arrant folly to pretend\nThat gods would have a thought for this dead man?\nDid they forsooth award him special grace,\nAnd as some benefactor bury him,\nWho came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,\nTo sack their shrines, to desolate their land,\nAnd scout their ordinances? Or perchance\nThe gods bestow their favors on the bad.\nNo! no! I have long noted malcontents\nWho wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,\nMisliking these my orders, and my rule.\n’Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards\nBy bribes. Of evils current upon earth\nThe worst is money. Money ’tis that sacks\nCities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;\nWarps and seduces native innocence,\nAnd breeds a habit of dishonesty.\nBut they who sold themselves shall find their greed\nOut-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.\nYea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,\nBy Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring\nBefore my presence here the very man\nWho carried out this lawless burial,\nDeath for your punishment shall not suffice.\nHanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make\nConfession of this outrage. This will teach you\nWhat practices are like to serve your turn.\nThere are some villainies that bring no gain.\nFor by dishonesty the few may thrive,\nThe many come to ruin and disgrace.\nGUARD.\nMay I not speak, or must I turn and go\nWithout a word?—\nCREON.\nBegone! canst thou not see\nThat e’en this question irks me?\nGUARD.\nWhere, my lord?\nIs it thy ears that suffer, or thy heart?\nCREON.\nWhy seek to probe and find the seat of pain?\nGUARD.\nI gall thine ears—this miscreant thy mind.\nCREON.\nWhat an inveterate babbler! get thee gone!\nGUARD.\nBabbler perchance, but innocent of the crime.\nCREON.\nTwice guilty, having sold thy soul for gain.\nGUARD.\nAlas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.\nCREON.\nGo, quibble with thy reason. If thou fail’st\nTo find these malefactors, thou shalt own\nThe wages of ill-gotten gains is death.\n[Exit CREON]\nGUARD.\nI pray he may be found. But caught or not\n(And fortune must determine that) thou never\nShalt see me here returning; that is sure.\nFor past all hope or thought I have escaped,\nAnd for my safety owe the gods much thanks.\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nMany wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;\nOver the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,\nThrough the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;\nAnd the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay\nEver he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,\nWith breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.\n(Ant. 1)\nThe light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood\nHe traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.\nMaster of cunning he: the savage bull, and the hart\nWho roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;\nAnd the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.\n(Str. 2)\nSpeech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,\nHe hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly\nAnd the nipping airs that freeze, ’neath the open winter sky.\nHe hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;\nSafe whate’er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.\n(Ant. 2)\nPassing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,\nThat guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.\nIf he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State\nProudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate\nWhoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;\nNe’er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.\nWhat strange vision meets my eyes,\nFills me with a wild surprise?\nSure I know her, sure ’tis she,\nThe maid Antigone.\nHapless child of hapless sire,\nDidst thou recklessly conspire,\nMadly brave the King’s decree?\nTherefore are they haling thee?\n[Enter GUARD bringing ANTIGONE]\nGUARD.\nHere is the culprit taken in the act\nOf giving burial. But where’s the King?\nCHORUS.\nThere from the palace he returns in time.\n[Enter CREON]\nCREON.\nWhy is my presence timely? What has chanced?\nGUARD.\nNo man, my lord, should make a vow, for if\nHe ever swears he will not do a thing,\nHis afterthoughts belie his first resolve.\nWhen from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled\nI sware thou wouldst not see me here again;\nBut the wild rapture of a glad surprise\nIntoxicates, and so I’m here forsworn.\nAnd here’s my prisoner, caught in the very act,\nDecking the grave. No lottery this time;\nThis prize is mine by right of treasure-trove.\nSo take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.\nShe’s thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim\nHence to depart well quit of all these ills.\nCREON.\nSay, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?\nGUARD.\nBurying the man. There’s nothing more to tell.\nCREON.\nHast thou thy wits? Or know’st thou what thou say’st?\nGUARD.\nI saw this woman burying the corpse\nAgainst thy orders. Is that clear and plain?\nCREON.\nBut how was she surprised and caught in the act?\nGUARD.\nIt happened thus. No sooner had we come,\nDriven from thy presence by those awful threats,\nThan straight we swept away all trace of dust,\nAnd bared the clammy body. Then we sat\nHigh on the ridge to windward of the stench,\nWhile each man kept he fellow alert and rated\nRoundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.\nSo all night long we watched, until the sun\nStood high in heaven, and his blazing beams\nSmote us. A sudden whirlwind then upraised\nA cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,\nAnd swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,\nAnd shook the firmament. We closed our eyes\nAnd waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.\nAt last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.\nA piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,\nAs when the mother bird beholds her nest\nRobbed of its nestlings; even so the maid\nWailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,\nAnd cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.\nAnon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,\nThen, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,\nThrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.\nWe at the sight swooped down on her and seized\nOur quarry. Undismayed she stood, and when\nWe taxed her with the former crime and this,\nShe disowned nothing. I was glad—and grieved;\nFor ’tis most sweet to ’scape oneself scot-free,\nAnd yet to bring disaster to a friend\nIs grievous. Take it all in all, I deem\nA man’s first duty is to serve himself.\nCREON.\nSpeak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,\nDoes thou plead guilty or deny the deed?\nANTIGONE.\nGuilty. I did it, I deny it not.\nCREON (to GUARD)\nSirrah, begone whither thou wilt, and thank\nThy luck that thou hast ’scaped a heavy charge.\n(To ANTIGONE)\nNow answer this plain question, yes or no,\nWast thou acquainted with the interdict?\nANTIGONE.\nI knew, all knew; how should I fail to know?\nCREON.\nAnd yet wert bold enough to break the law?\nANTIGONE.\nYea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus,\nAnd she who sits enthroned with gods below,\nJustice, enacted not these human laws.\nNor did I deem that thou, a mortal man,\nCould’st by a breath annul and override\nThe immutable unwritten laws of Heaven.\nThey were not born today nor yesterday;\nThey die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang.\nI was not like, who feared no mortal’s frown,\nTo disobey these laws and so provoke\nThe wrath of Heaven. I knew that I must die,\nE’en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death\nIs thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.\nFor death is gain to him whose life, like mine,\nIs full of misery. Thus my lot appears\nNot sad, but blissful; for had I endured\nTo leave my mother’s son unburied there,\nI should have grieved with reason, but not now.\nAnd if in this thou judgest me a fool,\nMethinks the judge of folly’s not acquit.\nCHORUS.\nA stubborn daughter of a stubborn sire,\nThis ill-starred maiden kicks against the pricks.\nCREON.\nWell, let her know the stubbornest of wills\nAre soonest bended, as the hardest iron,\nO’er-heated in the fire to brittleness,\nFlies soonest into fragments, shivered through.\nA snaffle curbs the fieriest steed, and he\nWho in subjection lives must needs be meek.\nBut this proud girl, in insolence well-schooled,\nFirst overstepped the established law, and then—\nA second and worse act of insolence—\nShe boasts and glories in her wickedness.\nNow if she thus can flout authority\nUnpunished, I am woman, she the man.\nBut though she be my sister’s child or nearer\nOf kin than all who worship at my hearth,\nNor she nor yet her sister shall escape\nThe utmost penalty, for both I hold,\nAs arch-conspirators, of equal guilt.\nBring forth the older; even now I saw her\nWithin the palace, frenzied and distraught.\nThe workings of the mind discover oft\nDark deeds in darkness schemed, before the act.\nMore hateful still the miscreant who seeks\nWhen caught, to make a virtue of a crime.\nANTIGONE.\nWould’st thou do more than slay thy prisoner?\nCREON.\nNot I, thy life is mine, and that’s enough.\nANTIGONE.\nWhy dally then? To me no word of thine\nIs pleasant: God forbid it e’er should please;\nNor am I more acceptable to thee.\nAnd yet how otherwise had I achieved\nA name so glorious as by burying\nA brother? so my townsmen all would say,\nWhere they not gagged by terror, Manifold\nA king’s prerogatives, and not the least\nThat all his acts and all his words are law.\nCREON.\nOf all these Thebans none so deems but thou.\nANTIGONE.\nThese think as I, but bate their breath to thee.\nCREON.\nHast thou no shame to differ from all these?\nANTIGONE.\nTo reverence kith and kin can bring no shame.\nCREON.\nWas his dead foeman not thy kinsman too?\nANTIGONE.\nOne mother bare them and the self-same sire.\nCREON.\nWhy cast a slur on one by honoring one?\nANTIGONE.\nThe dead man will not bear thee out in this.\nCREON.\nSurely, if good and evil fare alive.\nANTIGONE.\nThe slain man was no villain but a brother.\nCREON.\nThe patriot perished by the outlaw’s brand.\nANTIGONE.\nNathless the realms below these rites require.\nCREON.\nNot that the base should fare as do the brave.\nANTIGONE.\nWho knows if this world’s crimes are virtues there?\nCREON.\nNot even death can make a foe a friend.\nANTIGONE.\nMy nature is for mutual love, not hate.\nCREON.\nDie then, and love the dead if thou must;\nNo woman shall be the master while I live.\n[Enter ISMENE]\nCHORUS.\nLo from out the palace gate,\nWeeping o’er her sister’s fate,\nComes Ismene; see her brow,\nOnce serene, beclouded now,\nSee her beauteous face o’erspread\nWith a flush of angry red.\nCREON.\nWoman, who like a viper unperceived\nDidst harbor in my house and drain my blood,\nTwo plagues I nurtured blindly, so it proved,\nTo sap my throne. Say, didst thou too abet\nThis crime, or dost abjure all privity?\nISMENE.\nI did the deed, if she will have it so,\nAnd with my sister claim to share the guilt.\nANTIGONE.\nThat were unjust. Thou would’st not act with me\nAt first, and I refused thy partnership.\nISMENE.\nBut now thy bark is stranded, I am bold\nTo claim my share as partner in the loss.\nANTIGONE.\nWho did the deed the under-world knows well:\nA friend in word is never friend of mine.\nISMENE.\nO sister, scorn me not, let me but share\nThy work of piety, and with thee die.\nANTIGONE.\nClaim not a work in which thou hadst no hand;\nOne death sufficeth.

Then the boy,\nWroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent\nFell on his sword and drove it through his side\nHome, but yet breathing clasped in his lax arms\nThe maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined\nWith his expiring gasps. So there they lay\nTwo corpses, one in death. His marriage rites\nAre consummated in the halls of Death:\nA witness that of ills whate’er befall\nMortals’ unwisdom is the worst of all.\n[Exit EURYDICE]\nCHORUS.\nWhat makest thou of this?

It may be thou art right:\nUnnatural silence signifies no good.\nCHORUS.\nLo! the King himself appears.\nEvidence he with him bears\n’Gainst himself (ah me!

    "content":"OEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nOedipus, the blind and banished King of Thebes, has come in his wanderings to Colonus, a deme of Athens, led by his daughter Antigone. He sits to rest on a rock just within a sacred grove of the Furies and is bidden depart by a passing native. But Oedipus, instructed by an oracle that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to stir, and the stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the Chorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at first the blind beggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are horror-striken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will confer on the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus. From Theseus Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil; the benefits that will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs having promised to aid and befriend him. No sooner has he gone than Creon enters with an armed guard who seize Antigone and carry her off (Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured) and he is about to lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard the tumult, hurries up and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to detain him till he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the next scene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs Oedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon wishes to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father’s forgiveness and blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to the side that Oedipus espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and invokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of thunder is heard, and as peal follows peal, Oedipus is aware that his hour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus. Self-guided he leads the way to the spot where death should overtake him, attended by Theseus and his daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell, and what followed none but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports) for the gods took him.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nOEDIPUS, banished King of Thebes.\nANTIGONE, his daughter.\nISMENE, his daughter.\nTHESEUS, King of Athens.\nCREON, brother of Jocasta, now reigning at Thebes.\nPOLYNEICES, elder son of Oedipus.\nSTRANGER, a native of Colonus.\nMESSENGER, an attendant of Theseus.\nCHORUS, citizens of Colonus.\nScene: In front of the grove of the Eumenides.\nOEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nEnter the blind OEDIPUS led by his daughter, ANTIGONE.\nOEDIPUS.\nChild of an old blind sire, Antigone,\nWhat region, say, whose city have we reached?\nWho will provide today with scanted dole\nThis wanderer? ’Tis little that he craves,\nAnd less obtains—that less enough for me;\nFor I am taught by suffering to endure,\nAnd the long years that have grown old with me,\nAnd last not least, by true nobility.\nMy daughter, if thou seest a resting place\nOn common ground or by some sacred grove,\nStay me and set me down. Let us discover\nWhere we have come, for strangers must inquire\nOf denizens, and do as they are bid.\nANTIGONE.\nLong-suffering father, Oedipus, the towers\nThat fence the city still are faint and far;\nBut where we stand is surely holy ground;\nA wilderness of laurel, olive, vine;\nWithin a choir or songster nightingales\nAre warbling.

Yet am I then\nA villain born because in self-defense,\nStriken, I struck the striker back again?\nE’en had I known, no villainy ’twould prove:\nBut all unwitting whither I went, I went—\nTo ruin; my destroyers knew it well,\nWherefore, I pray you, sirs, in Heaven’s name,\nEven as ye bade me quit my seat, defend me.\nO pay not a lip service to the gods\nAnd wrong them of their dues.

Who serves his neighbor serves himself. 5\nANTIGONE.\nZeus! What is this? What can I say or think?\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat now, Antigone?\nANTIGONE.\nI see a woman\nRiding upon a colt of Aetna’s breed;\nShe wears for headgear a Thessalian hat\nTo shade her from the sun. Who can it be?\nShe or a stranger? Do I wake or dream?\n’Tis she; ’tis not—I cannot tell, alack;\nIt is no other! Now her bright’ning glance\nGreets me with recognition, yes, ’tis she,\nHerself, Ismene!\nOEDIPUS.\nHa! what say ye, child?\nANTIGONE.\nThat I behold thy daughter and my sister,\nAnd thou wilt know her straightway by her voice.\n[Enter ISMENE]\nISMENE.\nFather and sister, names to me most sweet,\nHow hardly have I found you, hardly now\nWhen found at last can see you through my tears!\nOEDIPUS.\nArt come, my child?\nISMENE.\nO father, sad thy plight!\nOEDIPUS.\nChild, thou art here?\nISMENE.\nYes, ’twas a weary way.\nOEDIPUS.\nTouch me, my child.\nISMENE.\nI give a hand to both.\nOEDIPUS.\nO children—sisters!\nISMENE.\nO disastrous plight!\nOEDIPUS.\nHer plight and mine?\nISMENE.\nAye, and my own no less.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat brought thee, daughter?\nISMENE.\nFather, care for thee.\nOEDIPUS.\nA daughter’s yearning?\nISMENE.\nYes, and I had news\nI would myself deliver, so I came\nWith the one thrall who yet is true to me.\nOEDIPUS.\nThy valiant brothers, where are they at need?\nISMENE.\nThey are—enough, ’tis now their darkest hour.\nOEDIPUS.\nOut on the twain! The thoughts and actions all\nAre framed and modeled on Egyptian ways.\nFor there the men sit at the loom indoors\nWhile the wives slave abroad for daily bread.\nSo you, my children—those whom I behooved\nTo bear the burden, stay at home like girls,\nWhile in their stead my daughters moil and drudge,\nLightening their father’s misery. The one\nSince first she grew from girlish feebleness\nTo womanhood has been the old man’s guide\nAnd shared my weary wandering, roaming oft\nHungry and footsore through wild forest ways,\nIn drenching rains and under scorching suns,\nCareless herself of home and ease, if so\nHer sire might have her tender ministry.\nAnd thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,\nEluding the Cadmeians’ vigilance,\nTo bring thy father all the oracles\nConcerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself\nMy faithful lieger, when they banished me.\nAnd now what mission summons thee from home,\nWhat news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?\nThis much I know, thou com’st not empty-handed,\nWithout a warning of some new alarm.\nISMENE.\nThe toil and trouble, father, that I bore\nTo find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,\nI spare thee; surely ’twere a double pain\nTo suffer, first in act and then in telling;\n’Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons\nI come to tell thee. At the first they willed\nTo leave the throne to Creon, minded well\nThus to remove the inveterate curse of old,\nA canker that infected all thy race.\nBut now some god and an infatuate soul\nHave stirred betwixt them a mad rivalry\nTo grasp at sovereignty and kingly power.\nToday the hot-branded youth, the younger born,\nIs keeping Polyneices from the throne,\nHis elder, and has thrust him from the land.\nThe banished brother (so all Thebes reports)\nFled to the vale of Argos, and by help\nOf new alliance there and friends in arms,\nSwears he will stablish Argos straight as lord\nOf the Cadmeian land, or, if he fail,\nExalt the victor to the stars of heaven.\nThis is no empty tale, but deadly truth,\nMy father; and how long thy agony,\nEre the gods pity thee, I cannot tell.\nOEDIPUS.\nHast thou indeed then entertained a hope\nThe gods at last will turn and rescue me?\nISMENE.\nYea, so I read these latest oracles.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat oracles? What hath been uttered, child?\nISMENE.\nThy country (so it runs) shall yearn in time\nTo have thee for their weal alive or dead.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd who could gain by such a one as I?\nISMENE.\nOn thee, ’tis said, their sovereignty depends.\nOEDIPUS.\nSo, when I cease to be, my worth begins.\nISMENE.\nThe gods, who once abased, uplift thee now.\nOEDIPUS.\nPoor help to raise an old man fallen in youth.\nISMENE.\nHowe’er that be, ’tis for this cause alone\nThat Creon comes to thee—and comes anon.\nOEDIPUS.\nWith what intent, my daughter?

Having come\nUnto a State that champions right and asks\nFor every action warranty of law,\nThou hast set aside the custom of the land,\nAnd like some freebooter art carrying off\nWhat plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth\nThou thoughtest this a city without men,\nOr manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.\nYet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;\nThebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,\nNor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou\nWert robbing me—aye and the gods to boot,\nHaling by force their suppliants, poor maids.\nWere I on Theban soil, to prosecute\nThe justest claim imaginable, I\nWould never wrest by violence my own\nWithout sanction of your State or King;\nI should behave as fits an outlander\nLiving amongst a foreign folk, but thou\nShamest a city that deserves it not,\nEven thine own, and plentitude of years\nHave made of thee an old man and a fool.\nTherefore again I charge thee as before,\nSee that the maidens are restored at once,\nUnless thou would’st continue here by force\nAnd not by choice a sojourner; so much\nI tell thee home and what I say, I mean.\nCHORUS.\nThy case is perilous; though by birth and race\nThou should’st be just, thou plainly doest wrong.\nCREON.\nNot deeming this city void of men\nOr counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say’st\nI did what I have done; rather I thought\nYour people were not like to set such store\nby kin of mine and keep them ’gainst my will.\nNor would they harbor, so I stood assured,\nA godless parricide, a reprobate\nConvicted of incestuous marriage ties.\nFor on her native hill of Ares here\n(I knew your far-famed Areopagus)\nSits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk\nTo stay within your borders. In that faith\nI hunted down my quarry; and e’en then\nI had refrained but for the curses dire\nWherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:\nSuch wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.\nAnger has no old age but only death;\nThe dead alone can feel no touch of spite.\nSo thou must work thy will; my cause is just\nBut weak without allies; yet will I try,\nOld as I am, to answer deeds with deeds.\nOEDIPUS.\nO shameless railer, think’st thou this abuse\nDefames my grey hairs rather than thine own?\nMurder and incest, deeds of horror, all\nThou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,\nNo willing sinner; so it pleased the gods\nWrath haply with my sinful race of old,\nSince thou could’st find no sin in me myself\nFor which in retribution I was doomed\nTo trespass thus against myself and mine.\nAnswer me now, if by some oracle\nMy sire was destined to a bloody end\nBy a son’s hand, can this reflect on me,\nMe then unborn, begotten by no sire,\nConceived in no mother’s womb? And if\nWhen born to misery, as born I was,\nI met my sire, not knowing whom I met\nor what I did, and slew him, how canst thou\nWith justice blame the all-unconscious hand?\nAnd for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,\nSeeing she was thy sister, to extort\nFrom me the story of her marriage, such\nA marriage as I straightway will proclaim.\nFor I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech\nHas broken all the bonds of reticence.\nShe was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;\nI knew it not, nor she; and she my mother\nBare children to the son whom she had borne,\nA birth of shame.

    "content":"OEDIPUS THE KING\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nTo Laius, King of Thebes, an oracle foretold that the child born to him by his queen Jocasta would slay his father and wed his mother. So when in time a son was born the infant’s feet were riveted together and he was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy, who grew up believing that he was indeed the King’s son. Afterwards doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he deemed his father’s house and in his flight he encountered and unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king. So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen. Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man. The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nOedipus.\nThe Priest of Zeus.\nCreon.\nChorus of Theban Elders.\nTeiresias.\nJocasta.\nMessenger.\nHerd of Laius.\nSecond Messenger.\nScene: Thebes. Before the Palace of Oedipus.\nOEDIPUS THE KING\nSuppliants of all ages are seated round the altar at the palace doors,\nat their head a PRIEST OF ZEUS. To them enter OEDIPUS.\nOEDIPUS.\nMy children, latest born to Cadmus old,\nWhy sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands\nBranches of olive filleted with wool?\nWhat means this reek of incense everywhere,\nAnd everywhere laments and litanies?\nChildren, it were not meet that I should learn\nFrom others, and am hither come, myself,\nI Oedipus, your world-renowned king.\nHo! aged sire, whose venerable locks\nProclaim thee spokesman of this company,\nExplain your mood and purport. Is it dread\nOf ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?\nMy zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;\nRuthless indeed were I and obdurate\nIf such petitioners as you I spurned.\nPRIEST.\nYea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,\nThou seest how both extremes of age besiege\nThy palace altars—fledglings hardly winged,\nand greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I\nof Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.\nMeanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs\nCrowd our two market-places, or before\nBoth shrines of Pallas congregate, or where\nIsmenus gives his oracles by fire.\nFor, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,\nSore buffeted, can no more lift her head,\nFoundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.\nA blight is on our harvest in the ear,\nA blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,\nA blight on wives in travail; and withal\nArmed with his blazing torch the God of Plague\nHath swooped upon our city emptying\nThe house of Cadmus, and the murky realm\nOf Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.\nTherefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,\nI and these children; not as deeming thee\nA new divinity, but the first of men;\nFirst in the common accidents of life,\nAnd first in visitations of the Gods.\nArt thou not he who coming to the town\nof Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid\nTo the fell songstress? Nor hadst thou received\nPrompting from us or been by others schooled;\nNo, by a god inspired (so all men deem,\nAnd testify) didst thou renew our life.\nAnd now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,\nAll we thy votaries beseech thee, find\nSome succor, whether by a voice from heaven\nWhispered, or haply known by human wit.\nTried counselors, methinks, are aptest found1\nTo furnish for the future pregnant rede.\nUpraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!\nLook to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore\nOur country’s savior thou art justly hailed:\nO never may we thus record thy reign:—\n“He raised us up only to cast us down.”\nUplift us, build our city on a rock.\nThy happy star ascendant brought us luck,\nO let it not decline! If thou wouldst rule\nThis land, as now thou reignest, better sure\nTo rule a peopled than a desert realm.\nNor battlements nor galleys aught avail,\nIf men to man and guards to guard them tail.\nOEDIPUS.\nAh! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,\nThe quest that brings you hither and your need.\nYe sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,\nHow great soever yours, outtops it all.\nYour sorrow touches each man severally,\nHim and none other, but I grieve at once\nBoth for the general and myself and you.\nTherefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.\nMany, my children, are the tears I’ve wept,\nAnd threaded many a maze of weary thought.\nThus pondering one clue of hope I caught,\nAnd tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus’ son,\nCreon, my consort’s brother, to inquire\nOf Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,\nHow I might save the State by act or word.\nAnd now I reckon up the tale of days\nSince he set forth, and marvel how he fares.\n’Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.\nBut when he comes, then I were base indeed,\nIf I perform not all the god declares.\nPRIEST.\nThy words are well timed; even as thou speakest\nThat shouting tells me Creon is at hand.\nOEDIPUS.\nO King Apollo! may his joyous looks\nBe presage of the joyous news he brings!\nPRIEST.\nAs I surmise, ’tis welcome; else his head\nHad scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.\nOEDIPUS.\nWe soon shall know; he’s now in earshot range.\n[Enter CREON]\nMy royal cousin, say, Menoeceus’ child,\nWhat message hast thou brought us from the god?\nCREON.\nGood news, for e’en intolerable ills,\nFinding right issue, tend to naught but good.\nOEDIPUS.\nHow runs the oracle? thus far thy words\nGive me no ground for confidence or fear.\nCREON.\nIf thou wouldst hear my message publicly,\nI’ll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.\nOEDIPUS.\nSpeak before all; the burden that I bear\nIs more for these my subjects than myself.\nCREON.\nLet me report then all the god declared.\nKing Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate\nA fell pollution that infests the land,\nAnd no more harbor an inveterate sore.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat expiation means he? What’s amiss?\nCREON.\nBanishment, or the shedding blood for blood.\nThis stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?\nCREON.\nBefore thou didst assume the helm of State,\nThe sovereign of this land was Laius.\nOEDIPUS.\nI heard as much, but never saw the man.\nCREON.\nHe fell; and now the god’s command is plain:\nPunish his takers-off, whoe’er they be.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere are they? Where in the wide world to find\nThe far, faint traces of a bygone crime?\nCREON.\nIn this land, said the god; “who seeks shall find;\nWho sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind.”\nOEDIPUS.\nWas he within his palace, or afield,\nOr traveling, when Laius met his fate?\nCREON.\nAbroad; he started, so he told us, bound\nFor Delphi, but he never thence returned.\nOEDIPUS.\nCame there no news, no fellow-traveler\nTo give some clue that might be followed up?\nCREON.\nBut one escape, who flying for dear life,\nCould tell of all he saw but one thing sure.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd what was that? One clue might lead us far,\nWith but a spark of hope to guide our quest.\nCREON.\nRobbers, he told us, not one bandit but\nA troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.\nOEDIPUS.\nDid any bandit dare so bold a stroke,\nUnless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?\nCREON.\nSo ’twas surmised, but none was found to avenge\nHis murder mid the trouble that ensued.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat trouble can have hindered a full quest,\nWhen royalty had fallen thus miserably?\nCREON.\nThe riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide\nThe dim past and attend to instant needs.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell, I will start afresh and once again\nMake dark things clear. Right worthy the concern\nOf Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;\nI also, as is meet, will lend my aid\nTo avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.\nNot for some far-off kinsman, but myself,\nShall I expel this poison in the blood;\nFor whoso slew that king might have a mind\nTo strike me too with his assassin hand.\nTherefore in righting him I serve myself.\nUp, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,\nTake hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither\nThe Theban commons. With the god’s good help\nSuccess is sure; ’tis ruin if we fail.\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and CREON]\nPRIEST.\nCome, children, let us hence; these gracious words\nForestall the very purpose of our suit.\nAnd may the god who sent this oracle\nSave us withal and rid us of this pest.\n[Exeunt PRIEST and SUPPLIANTS]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nSweet-voiced daughter of Zeus from thy gold-paved Pythian shrine\nWafted to Thebes divine,\nWhat dost thou bring me? My soul is racked and shivers with fear.\n(Healer of Delos, hear!)\nHast thou some pain unknown before,\nOr with the circling years renewest a penance of yore?\nOffspring of golden Hope, thou voice immortal, O tell me.\n(Ant. 1)\nFirst on Athene I call; O Zeus-born goddess, defend!\nGoddess and sister, befriend,\nArtemis, Lady of Thebes, high-throned in the midst of our mart!\nLord of the death-winged dart!\nYour threefold aid I crave\nFrom death and ruin our city to save.\nIf in the days of old when we nigh had perished, ye drave\nFrom our land the fiery plague, be near us now and defend us!\n(Str. 2)\nAh me, what countless woes are mine!\nAll our host is in decline;\nWeaponless my spirit lies.\nEarth her gracious fruits denies;\nWomen wail in barren throes;\nLife on life downstriken goes,\nSwifter than the wind bird’s flight,\nSwifter than the Fire-God’s might,\nTo the westering shores of Night.\n(Ant. 2)\nWasted thus by death on death\nAll our city perisheth.\nCorpses spread infection round;\nNone to tend or mourn is found.\nWailing on the altar stair\nWives and grandams rend the air—\nLong-drawn moans and piercing cries\nBlent with prayers and litanies.\nGolden child of Zeus, O hear\nLet thine angel face appear!\n(Str. 3)\nAnd grant that Ares whose hot breath I feel,\nThough without targe or steel\nHe stalks, whose voice is as the battle shout,\nMay turn in sudden rout,\nTo the unharbored Thracian waters sped,\nOr Amphitrite’s bed.\nFor what night leaves undone,\nSmit by the morrow’s sun\nPerisheth. Father Zeus, whose hand\nDoth wield the lightning brand,\nSlay him beneath thy levin bold, we pray,\nSlay him, O slay!\n(Ant. 3)\nO that thine arrows too, Lycean King,\nFrom that taut bow’s gold string,\nMight fly abroad, the champions of our rights;\nYea, and the flashing lights\nOf Artemis, wherewith the huntress sweeps\nAcross the Lycian steeps.\nThee too I call with golden-snooded hair,\nWhose name our land doth bear,\nBacchus to whom thy Maenads Evoe shout;\nCome with thy bright torch, rout,\nBlithe god whom we adore,\nThe god whom gods abhor.\n[Enter OEDIPUS.]\nOEDIPUS.\nYe pray; ’tis well, but would ye hear my words\nAnd heed them and apply the remedy,\nYe might perchance find comfort and relief.\nMind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger\nTo this report, no less than to the crime;\nFor how unaided could I track it far\nWithout a clue? Which lacking (for too late\nWas I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)\nThis proclamation I address to all:—\nThebans, if any knows the man by whom\nLaius, son of Labdacus, was slain,\nI summon him to make clean shrift to me.\nAnd if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus\nConfessing he shall ’scape the capital charge;\nFor the worst penalty that shall befall him\nIs banishment—unscathed he shall depart.\nBut if an alien from a foreign land\nBe known to any as the murderer,\nLet him who knows speak out, and he shall have\nDue recompense from me and thanks to boot.\nBut if ye still keep silence, if through fear\nFor self or friends ye disregard my hest,\nHear what I then resolve; I lay my ban\nOn the assassin whosoe’er he be.\nLet no man in this land, whereof I hold\nThe sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;\nGive him no part in prayer or sacrifice\nOr lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.\nFor this is our defilement, so the god\nHath lately shown to me by oracles.\nThus as their champion I maintain the cause\nBoth of the god and of the murdered King.\nAnd on the murderer this curse I lay\n(On him and all the partners in his guilt):—\nWretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!\nAnd for myself, if with my privity\nHe gain admittance to my hearth, I pray\nThe curse I laid on others fall on me.\nSee that ye give effect to all my hest,\nFor my sake and the god’s and for our land,\nA desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.\nFor, let alone the god’s express command,\nIt were a scandal ye should leave unpurged\nThe murder of a great man and your king,\nNor track it home. And now that I am lord,\nSuccessor to his throne, his bed, his wife,\n(And had he not been frustrate in the hope\nOf issue, common children of one womb\nHad forced a closer bond twixt him and me,\nBut Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I\nHis blood-avenger will maintain his cause\nAs though he were my sire, and leave no stone\nUnturned to track the assassin or avenge\nThe son of Labdacus, of Polydore,\nOf Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.\nAnd for the disobedient thus I pray:\nMay the gods send them neither timely fruits\nOf earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,\nBut may they waste and pine, as now they waste,\nAye and worse stricken; but to all of you,\nMy loyal subjects who approve my acts,\nMay Justice, our ally, and all the gods\nBe gracious and attend you evermore.\nCHORUS.\nThe oath thou profferest, sire, I take and swear.\nI slew him not myself, nor can I name\nThe slayer. For the quest, ’twere well, methinks\nThat Phoebus, who proposed the riddle, himself\nShould give the answer—who the murderer was.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell argued; but no living man can hope\nTo force the gods to speak against their will.\nCHORUS.\nMay I then say what seems next best to me?\nOEDIPUS.\nAye, if there be a third best, tell it too.\nCHORUS.\nMy liege, if any man sees eye to eye\nWith our lord Phoebus, ’tis our prophet, lord\nTeiresias; he of all men best might guide\nA searcher of this matter to the light.\nOEDIPUS.\nHere too my zeal has nothing lagged, for twice\nAt Creon’s instance have I sent to fetch him,\nAnd long I marvel why he is not here.\nCHORUS.\nI mind me too of rumors long ago—\nMere gossip.\nOEDIPUS.\nTell them, I would fain know all.\nCHORUS.\n’Twas said he fell by travelers.\nOEDIPUS.\nSo I heard,\nBut none has seen the man who saw him fall.\nCHORUS.\nWell, if he knows what fear is, he will quail\nAnd flee before the terror of thy curse.\nOEDIPUS.\nWords scare not him who blenches not at deeds.\nCHORUS.\nBut here is one to arraign him. Lo, at length\nThey bring the god-inspired seer in whom\nAbove all other men is truth inborn.\n[Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy.]\nOEDIPUS.\nTeiresias, seer who comprehendest all,\nLore of the wise and hidden mysteries,\nHigh things of heaven and low things of the earth,\nThou knowest, though thy blinded eyes see naught,\nWhat plague infects our city; and we turn\nTo thee, O seer, our one defense and shield.\nThe purport of the answer that the God\nReturned to us who sought his oracle,\nThe messengers have doubtless told thee—how\nOne course alone could rid us of the pest,\nTo find the murderers of Laius,\nAnd slay them or expel them from the land.\nTherefore begrudging neither augury\nNor other divination that is thine,\nO save thyself, thy country, and thy king,\nSave all from this defilement of blood shed.\nOn thee we rest. This is man’s highest end,\nTo others’ service all his powers to lend.\nTEIRESIAS.\nAlas, alas, what misery to be wise\nWhen wisdom profits nothing! This old lore\nI had forgotten; else I were not here.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat ails thee? Why this melancholy mood?\nTEIRESIAS.\nLet me go home; prevent me not; ’twere best\nThat thou shouldst bear thy burden and I mine.\nOEDIPUS.\nFor shame! no true-born Theban patriot\nWould thus withhold the word of prophecy.\nTEIRESIAS.\nThy words, O king, are wide of the mark, and I\nFor fear lest I too trip like thee...\nOEDIPUS.\nOh speak,\nWithhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know’st,\nThy knowledge. We are all thy suppliants.\nTEIRESIAS.\nAye, for ye all are witless, but my voice\nWill ne’er reveal my miseries—or thine.2\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat then, thou knowest, and yet willst not speak!\nWouldst thou betray us and destroy the State?\nTEIRESIAS.\nI will not vex myself nor thee. Why ask\nThus idly what from me thou shalt not learn?\nOEDIPUS.\nMonster! thy silence would incense a flint.\nWill nothing loose thy tongue? Can nothing melt thee,\nOr shake thy dogged taciturnity?\nTEIRESIAS.\nThou blam’st my mood and seest not thine own\nWherewith thou art mated; no, thou taxest me.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd who could stay his choler when he heard\nHow insolently thou dost flout the State?\nTEIRESIAS.\nWell, it will come what will, though I be mute.\nOEDIPUS.\nSince come it must, thy duty is to tell me.\nTEIRESIAS.\nI have no more to say; storm as thou willst,\nAnd give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.\nOEDIPUS.\nYea, I am wroth, and will not stint my words,\nBut speak my whole mind. Thou methinks thou art he,\nWho planned the crime, aye, and performed it too,\nAll save the assassination; and if thou\nHadst not been blind, I had been sworn to boot\nThat thou alone didst do the bloody deed.\nTEIRESIAS.\nIs it so? Then I charge thee to abide\nBy thine own proclamation; from this day\nSpeak not to these or me. Thou art the man,\nThou the accursed polluter of this land.\nOEDIPUS.\nVile slanderer, thou blurtest forth these taunts,\nAnd think’st forsooth as seer to go scot free.\nTEIRESIAS.\nYea, I am free, strong in the strength of truth.\nOEDIPUS.\nWho was thy teacher? not methinks thy art.\nTEIRESIAS.\nThou, goading me against my will to speak.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat speech? repeat it and resolve my doubt.\nTEIRESIAS.\nDidst miss my sense wouldst thou goad me on?\nOEDIPUS.\nI but half caught thy meaning; say it again.\nTEIRESIAS.\nI say thou art the murderer of the man\nWhose murderer thou pursuest.\nOEDIPUS.\nThou shalt rue it\nTwice to repeat so gross a calumny.\nTEIRESIAS.\nMust I say more to aggravate thy rage?\nOEDIPUS.\nSay all thou wilt; it will be but waste of breath.\nTEIRESIAS.\nI say thou livest with thy nearest kin\nIn infamy, unwitting in thy shame.\nOEDIPUS.\nThink’st thou for aye unscathed to wag thy tongue?\nTEIRESIAS.\nYea, if the might of truth can aught prevail.\nOEDIPUS.\nWith other men, but not with thee, for thou\nIn ear, wit, eye, in everything art blind.\nTEIRESIAS.\nPoor fool to utter gibes at me which all\nHere present will cast back on thee ere long.\nOEDIPUS.\nOffspring of endless Night, thou hast no power\nO’er me or any man who sees the sun.\nTEIRESIAS.\nNo, for thy weird is not to fall by me.\nI leave to Apollo what concerns the god.\nOEDIPUS.\nIs this a plot of Creon, or thine own?\nTEIRESIAS.\nNot Creon, thou thyself art thine own bane.\nOEDIPUS.\nO wealth and empiry and skill by skill\nOutwitted in the battlefield of life,\nWhat spite and envy follow in your train!\nSee, for this crown the State conferred on me.\nA gift, a thing I sought not, for this crown\nThe trusty Creon, my familiar friend,\nHath lain in wait to oust me and suborned\nThis mountebank, this juggling charlatan,\nThis tricksy beggar-priest, for gain alone\nKeen-eyed, but in his proper art stone-blind.\nSay, sirrah, hast thou ever proved thyself\nA prophet? When the riddling Sphinx was here\nWhy hadst thou no deliverance for this folk?\nAnd yet the riddle was not to be solved\nBy guess-work but required the prophet’s art;\nWherein thou wast found lacking; neither birds\nNor sign from heaven helped thee, but I came,\nThe simple Oedipus; I stopped her mouth\nBy mother wit, untaught of auguries.\nThis is the man whom thou wouldst undermine,\nIn hope to reign with Creon in my stead.\nMethinks that thou and thine abettor soon\nWill rue your plot to drive the scapegoat out.\nThank thy grey hairs that thou hast still to learn\nWhat chastisement such arrogance deserves.\nCHORUS.\nTo us it seems that both the seer and thou,\nO Oedipus, have spoken angry words.\nThis is no time to wrangle but consult\nHow best we may fulfill the oracle.\nTEIRESIAS.\nKing as thou art, free speech at least is mine\nTo make reply; in this I am thy peer.\nI own no lord but Loxias; him I serve\nAnd ne’er can stand enrolled as Creon’s man.\nThus then I answer: since thou hast not spared\nTo twit me with my blindness—thou hast eyes,\nYet see’st not in what misery thou art fallen,\nNor where thou dwellest nor with whom for mate.\nDost know thy lineage? Nay, thou know’st it not,\nAnd all unwitting art a double foe\nTo thine own kin, the living and the dead;\nAye and the dogging curse of mother and sire\nOne day shall drive thee, like a two-edged sword,\nBeyond our borders, and the eyes that now\nSee clear shall henceforward endless night.\nAh whither shall thy bitter cry not reach,\nWhat crag in all Cithaeron but shall then\nReverberate thy wail, when thou hast found\nWith what a hymeneal thou wast borne\nHome, but to no fair haven, on the gale!\nAye, and a flood of ills thou guessest not\nShall set thyself and children in one line.\nFlout then both Creon and my words, for none\nOf mortals shall be striken worse than thou.\nOEDIPUS.\nMust I endure this fellow’s insolence?\nA murrain on thee! Get thee hence!

An oracle\nOnce came to Laius (I will not say\n’Twas from the Delphic god himself, but from\nHis ministers) declaring he was doomed\nTo perish by the hand of his own son,\nA child that should be born to him by me.\nNow Laius—so at least report affirmed—\nWas murdered on a day by highwaymen,\nNo natives, at a spot where three roads meet.\nAs for the child, it was but three days old,\nWhen Laius, its ankles pierced and pinned\nTogether, gave it to be cast away\nBy others on the trackless mountain side.\nSo then Apollo brought it not to pass\nThe child should be his father’s murderer,\nOr the dread terror find accomplishment,\nAnd Laius be slain by his own son.\nSuch was the prophet’s horoscope. O king,\nRegard it not. Whate’er the god deems fit\nTo search, himself unaided will reveal.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat memories, what wild tumult of the soul\nCame o’er me, lady, as I heard thee speak!\nJOCASTA.\nWhat mean’st thou? What has shocked and startled thee?\nOEDIPUS.\nMethought I heard thee say that Laius\nWas murdered at the meeting of three roads.\nJOCASTA.\nSo ran the story that is current still.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere did this happen? Dost thou know the place?\nJOCASTA.\nPhocis the land is called; the spot is where\nBranch roads from Delphi and from Daulis meet.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd how long is it since these things befell?\nJOCASTA.\n’Twas but a brief while were thou wast proclaimed\nOur country’s ruler that the news was brought.\nOEDIPUS.\nO Zeus, what hast thou willed to do with me!\nJOCASTA.\nWhat is it, Oedipus, that moves thee so?\nOEDIPUS.\nAsk me not yet; tell me the build and height\nOf Laius? Was he still in manhood’s prime?\nJOCASTA.\nTall was he, and his hair was lightly strewn\nWith silver; and not unlike thee in form.\nOEDIPUS.\nO woe is me! Mehtinks unwittingly\nI laid but now a dread curse on myself.\nJOCASTA.\nWhat say’st thou? When I look upon thee, my king,\nI tremble.\nOEDIPUS.\n’Tis a dread presentiment\nThat in the end the seer will prove not blind.\nOne further question to resolve my doubt.\nJOCASTA.\nI quail; but ask, and I will answer all.\nOEDIPUS.\nHad he but few attendants or a train\nOf armed retainers with him, like a prince?\nJOCASTA.\nThey were but five in all, and one of them\nA herald; Laius in a mule-car rode.\nOEDIPUS.\nAlas! ’tis clear as noonday now. But say,\nLady, who carried this report to Thebes?\nJOCASTA.\nA serf, the sole survivor who returned.\nOEDIPUS.\nHaply he is at hand or in the house?\nJOCASTA.\nNo, for as soon as he returned and found\nThee reigning in the stead of Laius slain,\nHe clasped my hand and supplicated me\nTo send him to the alps and pastures, where\nHe might be farthest from the sight of Thebes.\nAnd so I sent him. ’Twas an honest slave\nAnd well deserved some better recompense.\nOEDIPUS.\nFetch him at once. I fain would see the man.\nJOCASTA.\nHe shall be brought; but wherefore summon him?\nOEDIPUS.\nLady, I fear my tongue has overrun\nDiscretion; therefore I would question him.\nJOCASTA.\nWell, he shall come, but may not I too claim\nTo share the burden of thy heart, my king?\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish.\nNow my imaginings have gone so far.\nWho has a higher claim that thou to hear\nMy tale of dire adventures? Listen then.\nMy sire was Polybus of Corinth, and\nMy mother Merope, a Dorian;\nAnd I was held the foremost citizen,\nTill a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,\nYet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.\nA roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,\nShouted “Thou art not true son of thy sire.”\nIt irked me, but I stomached for the nonce\nThe insult; on the morrow I sought out\nMy mother and my sire and questioned them.\nThey were indignant at the random slur\nCast on my parentage and did their best\nTo comfort me, but still the venomed barb\nRankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.\nSo privily without their leave I went\nTo Delphi, and Apollo sent me back\nBaulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.\nBut other grievous things he prophesied,\nWoes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;\nTo wit I should defile my mother’s bed\nAnd raise up seed too loathsome to behold,\nAnd slay the father from whose loins I sprang.\nThen, lady,—thou shalt hear the very truth—\nAs I drew near the triple-branching roads,\nA herald met me and a man who sat\nIn a car drawn by colts—as in thy tale—\nThe man in front and the old man himself\nThreatened to thrust me rudely from the path,\nThen jostled by the charioteer in wrath\nI struck him, and the old man, seeing this,\nWatched till I passed and from his car brought down\nFull on my head the double-pointed goad.\nYet was I quits with him and more; one stroke\nOf my good staff sufficed to fling him clean\nOut of the chariot seat and laid him prone.\nAnd so I slew them every one. But if\nBetwixt this stranger there was aught in common\nWith Laius, who more miserable than I,\nWhat mortal could you find more god-abhorred?\nWretch whom no sojourner, no citizen\nMay harbor or address, whom all are bound\nTo harry from their homes. And this same curse\nWas laid on me, and laid by none but me.\nYea with these hands all gory I pollute\nThe bed of him I slew. Say, am I vile?\nAm I not utterly unclean, a wretch\nDoomed to be banished, and in banishment\nForgo the sight of all my dearest ones,\nAnd never tread again my native earth;\nOr else to wed my mother and slay my sire,\nPolybus, who begat me and upreared?\nIf one should say, this is the handiwork\nOf some inhuman power, who could blame\nHis judgment? But, ye pure and awful gods,\nForbid, forbid that I should see that day!\nMay I be blotted out from living men\nEre such a plague spot set on me its brand!\nCHORUS.\nWe too, O king, are troubled; but till thou\nHast questioned the survivor, still hope on.\nOEDIPUS.\nMy hope is faint, but still enough survives\nTo bid me bide the coming of this herd.\nJOCASTA.\nSuppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?\nOEDIPUS.\nI’ll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees\nWith thine, I shall have ’scaped calamity.\nJOCASTA.\nAnd what of special import did I say?\nOEDIPUS.\nIn thy report of what the herdsman said\nLaius was slain by robbers; now if he\nStill speaks of robbers, not a robber, I\nSlew him not; “one” with “many” cannot square.\nBut if he says one lonely wayfarer,\nThe last link wanting to my guilt is forged.\nJOCASTA.\nWell, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,\nNor can he now retract what then he said;\nNot I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.\nE’en should he vary somewhat in his story,\nHe cannot make the death of Laius\nIn any wise jump with the oracle.\nFor Loxias said expressly he was doomed\nTo die by my child’s hand, but he, poor babe,\nHe shed no blood, but perished first himself.\nSo much for divination. Henceforth I\nWill look for signs neither to right nor left.\nOEDIPUS.\nThou reasonest well. Still I would have thee send\nAnd fetch the bondsman hither. See to it.\nJOCASTA.\nThat will I straightway. Come, let us within.\nI would do nothing that my lord mislikes.\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and JOCASTA]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nMy lot be still to lead\nThe life of innocence and fly\nIrreverence in word or deed,\nTo follow still those laws ordained on high\nWhose birthplace is the bright ethereal sky\nNo mortal birth they own,\nOlympus their progenitor alone:\nNe’er shall they slumber in oblivion cold,\nThe god in them is strong and grows not old.\n(Ant. 1)\nOf insolence is bred\nThe tyrant; insolence full blown,\nWith empty riches surfeited,\nScales the precipitous height and grasps the throne.\nThen topples o’er and lies in ruin prone;\nNo foothold on that dizzy steep.\nBut O may Heaven the true patriot keep\nWho burns with emulous zeal to serve the State.\nGod is my help and hope, on him I wait.\n(Str. 2)\nBut the proud sinner, or in word or deed,\nThat will not Justice heed,\nNor reverence the shrine\nOf images divine,\nPerdition seize his vain imaginings,\nIf, urged by greed profane,\nHe grasps at ill-got gain,\nAnd lays an impious hand on holiest things.\nWho when such deeds are done\nCan hope heaven’s bolts to shun?\nIf sin like this to honor can aspire,\nWhy dance I still and lead the sacred choir?\n(Ant. 2)\nNo more I’ll seek earth’s central oracle,\nOr Abae’s hallowed cell,\nNor to Olympia bring\nMy votive offering.\nIf before all God’s truth be not bade plain.\nO Zeus, reveal thy might,\nKing, if thou’rt named aright\nOmnipotent, all-seeing, as of old;\nFor Laius is forgot;\nHis weird, men heed it not;\nApollo is forsook and faith grows cold.\n[Enter JOCASTA.]\nJOCASTA.\nMy lords, ye look amazed to see your queen\nWith wreaths and gifts of incense in her hands.\nI had a mind to visit the high shrines,\nFor Oedipus is overwrought, alarmed\nWith terrors manifold.

Let it be.\n’Twere waste of thought to weigh such idle words.\nOEDIPUS.\nNo, with such guiding clues I cannot fail\nTo bring to light the secret of my birth.\nJOCASTA.\nOh, as thou carest for thy life, give o’er\nThis quest. Enough the anguish I endure.\nOEDIPUS.\nBe of good cheer; though I be proved the son\nOf a bondwoman, aye, through three descents\nTriply a slave, thy honor is unsmirched.\nJOCASTA.\nYet humor me, I pray thee; do not this.\nOEDIPUS.\nI cannot; I must probe this matter home.\nJOCASTA.\n’Tis for thy sake I advise thee for the best.\nOEDIPUS.\nI grow impatient of this best advice.\nJOCASTA.\nAh mayst thou ne’er discover who thou art!\nOEDIPUS.\nGo, fetch me here the herd, and leave yon woman\nTo glory in her pride of ancestry.\nJOCASTA.\nO woe is thee, poor wretch! With that last word\nI leave thee, henceforth silent evermore.\n[Exit JOCASTA]\nCHORUS.\nWhy, Oedipus, why stung with passionate grief\nHath the queen thus departed? Much I fear\nFrom this dead calm will burst a storm of woes.\nOEDIPUS.\nLet the storm burst, my fixed resolve still holds,\nTo learn my lineage, be it ne’er so low.\nIt may be she with all a woman’s pride\nThinks scorn of my base parentage. But I\nWho rank myself as Fortune’s favorite child,\nThe giver of good gifts, shall not be shamed.\nShe is my mother and the changing moons\nMy brethren, and with them I wax and wane.\nThus sprung why should I fear to trace my birth?\nNothing can make me other than I am.\nCHORUS.\n(Str.)\nIf my soul prophetic err not, if my wisdom aught avail,\nThee, Cithaeron, I shall hail,\nAs the nurse and foster-mother of our Oedipus shall greet\nEre tomorrow’s full moon rises, and exalt thee as is meet.\nDance and song shall hymn thy praises, lover of our royal race.\nPhoebus, may my words find grace!\n(Ant.)\nChild, who bare thee, nymph or goddess? sure thy sure was more than\nman,\nHaply the hill-roamer Pan.\nOf did Loxias beget thee, for he haunts the upland wold;\nOr Cyllene’s lord, or Bacchus, dweller on the hilltops cold?\nDid some Heliconian Oread give him thee, a new-born joy?\nNymphs with whom he love to toy?\nOEDIPUS.\nElders, if I, who never yet before\nHave met the man, may make a guess, methinks\nI see the herdsman who we long have sought;\nHis time-worn aspect matches with the years\nOf yonder aged messenger; besides\nI seem to recognize the men who bring him\nAs servants of my own. But you, perchance,\nHaving in past days known or seen the herd,\nMay better by sure knowledge my surmise.\nCHORUS.\nI recognize him; one of Laius’ house;\nA simple hind, but true as any man.\n[Enter HERDSMAN.]\nOEDIPUS.\nCorinthian, stranger, I address thee first,\nIs this the man thou meanest!\nMESSENGER.\nThis is he.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd now old man, look up and answer all\nI ask thee.

But I will revive\nHis blunted memories. Sure he can recall\nWhat time together both we drove our flocks,\nHe two, I one, on the Cithaeron range,\nFor three long summers; I his mate from spring\nTill rose Arcturus; then in winter time\nI led mine home, he his to Laius’ folds.\nDid these things happen as I say, or no?\nHERDSMAN.\n’Tis long ago, but all thou say’st is true.\nMESSENGER.\nWell, thou mast then remember giving me\nA child to rear as my own foster-son?\nHERDSMAN.\nWhy dost thou ask this question? What of that?\nMESSENGER.\nFriend, he that stands before thee was that child.\nHERDSMAN.\nA plague upon thee!

And all the horror of it,\nNot having seen, yet cannot comprehend.\nNathless, as far as my poor memory serves,\nI will relate the unhappy lady’s woe.\nWhen in her frenzy she had passed inside\nThe vestibule, she hurried straight to win\nThe bridal-chamber, clutching at her hair\nWith both her hands, and, once within the room,\nShe shut the doors behind her with a crash.\n“Laius,” she cried, and called her husband dead\nLong, long ago; her thought was of that child\nBy him begot, the son by whom the sire\nWas murdered and the mother left to breed\nWith her own seed, a monstrous progeny.\nThen she bewailed the marriage bed whereon\nPoor wretch, she had conceived a double brood,\nHusband by husband, children by her child.\nWhat happened after that I cannot tell,\nNor how the end befell, for with a shriek\nBurst on us Oedipus; all eyes were fixed\nOn Oedipus, as up and down he strode,\nNor could we mark her agony to the end.\nFor stalking to and fro “A sword!” he cried,\n“Where is the wife, no wife, the teeming womb\nThat bore a double harvest, me and mine?”\nAnd in his frenzy some supernal power\n(No mortal, surely, none of us who watched him)\nGuided his footsteps; with a terrible shriek,\nAs though one beckoned him, he crashed against\nThe folding doors, and from their staples forced\nThe wrenched bolts and hurled himself within.\nThen we beheld the woman hanging there,\nA running noose entwined about her neck.\nBut when he saw her, with a maddened roar\nHe loosed the cord; and when her wretched corpse\nLay stretched on earth, what followed—O ’twas dread!\nHe tore the golden brooches that upheld\nHer queenly robes, upraised them high and smote\nFull on his eye-balls, uttering words like these:\n“No more shall ye behold such sights of woe,\nDeeds I have suffered and myself have wrought;\nHenceforward quenched in darkness shall ye see\nThose ye should ne’er have seen; now blind to those\nWhom, when I saw, I vainly yearned to know.”\nSuch was the burden of his moan, whereto,\nNot once but oft, he struck with his hand uplift\nHis eyes, and at each stroke the ensanguined orbs\nBedewed his beard, not oozing drop by drop,\nBut one black gory downpour, thick as hail.\nSuch evils, issuing from the double source,\nHave whelmed them both, confounding man and wife.\nTill now the storied fortune of this house\nWas fortunate indeed; but from this day\nWoe, lamentation, ruin, death, disgrace,\nAll ills that can be named, all, all are theirs.\nCHORUS.\nBut hath he still no respite from his pain?\nSECOND MESSENGER.\nHe cries, “Unbar the doors and let all Thebes\nBehold the slayer of his sire, his mother’s—”\nThat shameful word my lips may not repeat.\nHe vows to fly self-banished from the land,\nNor stay to bring upon his house the curse\nHimself had uttered; but he has no strength\nNor one to guide him, and his torture’s more\nThan man can suffer, as yourselves will see.\nFor lo, the palace portals are unbarred,\nAnd soon ye shall behold a sight so sad\nThat he who must abhorred would pity it.\n[Enter OEDIPUS blinded.]\nCHORUS.\nWoeful sight! more woeful none\nThese sad eyes have looked upon.\nWhence this madness? None can tell\nWho did cast on thee his spell,\nprowling all thy life around,\nLeaping with a demon bound.\nHapless wretch! how can I brook\nOn thy misery to look?\nThough to gaze on thee I yearn,\nMuch to question, much to learn,\nHorror-struck away I turn.\nOEDIPUS.\nAh me! ah woe is me!\nAh whither am I borne!\nHow like a ghost forlorn\nMy voice flits from me on the air!\nOn, on the demon goads. The end, ah where?\nCHORUS.\nAn end too dread to tell, too dark to see.\nOEDIPUS.\n(Str. 1)\nDark, dark! The horror of darkness, like a shroud,\nWraps me and bears me on through mist and cloud.\nAh me, ah me! What spasms athwart me shoot,\nWhat pangs of agonizing memory?\nCHORUS.\nNo marvel if in such a plight thou feel’st\nThe double weight of past and present woes.\nOEDIPUS.\n(Ant. 1)\nAh friend, still loyal, constant still and kind,\nThou carest for the blind.\nI know thee near, and though bereft of eyes,\nThy voice I recognize.\nCHORUS.\nO doer of dread deeds, how couldst thou mar\nThy vision thus? What demon goaded thee?\nOEDIPUS.\n(Str. 2)\nApollo, friend, Apollo, he it was\nThat brought these ills to pass;\nBut the right hand that dealt the blow\nWas mine, none other. How,\nHow, could I longer see when sight\nBrought no delight?\nCHORUS.\nAlas! ’tis as thou sayest.\nOEDIPUS.\nSay, friends, can any look or voice\nOr touch of love henceforth my heart rejoice?\nHaste, friends, no fond delay,\nTake the twice cursed away\nFar from all ken,\nThe man abhorred of gods, accursed of men.\nCHORUS.\nO thy despair well suits thy desperate case.\nWould I had never looked upon thy face!\nOEDIPUS.\n(Ant. 2)\nMy curse on him whoe’er unrived\nThe waif’s fell fetters and my life revived!\nHe meant me well, yet had he left me there,\nHe had saved my friends and me a world of care.\nCHORUS.\nI too had wished it so.\nOEDIPUS.\nThen had I never come to shed\nMy father’s blood nor climbed my mother’s bed;\nThe monstrous offspring of a womb defiled,\nCo-mate of him who gendered me, and child.\nWas ever man before afflicted thus,\nLike Oedipus.\nCHORUS.\nI cannot say that thou hast counseled well,\nFor thou wert better dead than living blind.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat’s done was well done. Thou canst never shake\nMy firm belief. A truce to argument.\nFor, had I sight, I know not with what eyes\nI could have met my father in the shades,\nOr my poor mother, since against the twain\nI sinned, a sin no gallows could atone.\nAye, but, ye say, the sight of children joys\nA parent’s eyes. What, born as mine were born?\nNo, such a sight could never bring me joy;\nNor this fair city with its battlements,\nIts temples and the statues of its gods,\nSights from which I, now wretchedst of all,\nOnce ranked the foremost Theban in all Thebes,\nBy my own sentence am cut off, condemned\nBy my own proclamation ’gainst the wretch,\nThe miscreant by heaven itself declared\nUnclean—and of the race of Laius.\nThus branded as a felon by myself,\nHow had I dared to look you in the face?\nNay, had I known a way to choke the springs\nOf hearing, I had never shrunk to make\nA dungeon of this miserable frame,\nCut off from sight and hearing; for ’tis bliss\nto bide in regions sorrow cannot reach.\nWhy didst thou harbor me, Cithaeron, why\nDidst thou not take and slay me? Then I never\nHad shown to men the secret of my birth.\nO Polybus, O Corinth, O my home,\nHome of my ancestors (so wast thou called)\nHow fair a nursling then I seemed, how foul\nThe canker that lay festering in the bud!\nNow is the blight revealed of root and fruit.\nYe triple high-roads, and thou hidden glen,\nCoppice, and pass where meet the three-branched ways,\nYe drank my blood, the life-blood these hands spilt,\nMy father’s; do ye call to mind perchance\nThose deeds of mine ye witnessed and the work\nI wrought thereafter when I came to Thebes?\nO fatal wedlock, thou didst give me birth,\nAnd, having borne me, sowed again my seed,\nMingling the blood of fathers, brothers, children,\nBrides, wives and mothers, an incestuous brood,\nAll horrors that are wrought beneath the sun,\nHorrors so foul to name them were unmeet.\nO, I adjure you, hide me anywhere\nFar from this land, or slay me straight, or cast me\nDown to the depths of ocean out of sight.\nCome hither, deign to touch an abject wretch;\nDraw near and fear not; I myself must bear\nThe load of guilt that none but I can share.\n[Enter CREON.]\nCREON.\nLo, here is Creon, the one man to grant\nThy prayer by action or advice, for he\nIs left the State’s sole guardian in thy stead.\nOEDIPUS.\nAh me! what words to accost him can I find?\nWhat cause has he to trust me? In the past\nI have bee proved his rancorous enemy.\nCREON.\nNot in derision, Oedipus, I come\nNor to upbraid thee with thy past misdeeds.\n(To BYSTANDERS)\nBut shame upon you! if ye feel no sense\nOf human decencies, at least revere\nThe Sun whose light beholds and nurtures all.\nLeave not thus nakedly for all to gaze at\nA horror neither earth nor rain from heaven\nNor light will suffer. Lead him straight within,\nFor it is seemly that a kinsman’s woes\nBe heard by kin and seen by kin alone.\nOEDIPUS.\nO listen, since thy presence comes to me\nA shock of glad surprise—so noble thou,\nAnd I so vile—O grant me one small boon.\nI ask it not on my behalf, but thine.\nCREON.\nAnd what the favor thou wouldst crave of me?\nOEDIPUS.\nForth from thy borders thrust me with all speed;\nSet me within some vasty desert where\nNo mortal voice shall greet me any more.\nCREON.\nThis had I done already, but I deemed\nIt first behooved me to consult the god.\nOEDIPUS.\nHis will was set forth fully—to destroy\nThe parricide, the scoundrel; and I am he.\nCREON.\nYea, so he spake, but in our present plight\n’Twere better to consult the god anew.\nOEDIPUS.\nDare ye inquire concerning such a wretch?\nCREON.\nYea, for thyself wouldst credit now his word.\nOEDIPUS.\nAye, and on thee in all humility\nI lay this charge: let her who lies within\nReceive such burial as thou shalt ordain;\nSuch rites ’tis thine, as brother, to perform.\nBut for myself, O never let my Thebes,\nThe city of my sires, be doomed to bear\nThe burden of my presence while I live.\nNo, let me be a dweller on the hills,\nOn yonder mount Cithaeron, famed as mine,\nMy tomb predestined for me by my sire\nAnd mother, while they lived, that I may die\nSlain as they sought to slay me, when alive.\nThis much I know full surely, nor disease\nShall end my days, nor any common chance;\nFor I had ne’er been snatched from death, unless\nI was predestined to some awful doom.\nSo be it. I reck not how Fate deals with me\nBut my unhappy children—for my sons\nBe not concerned, O Creon, they are men,\nAnd for themselves, where’er they be, can fend.\nBut for my daughters twain, poor innocent maids,\nWho ever sat beside me at the board\nSharing my viands, drinking of my cup,\nFor them, I pray thee, care, and, if thou willst,\nO might I feel their touch and make my moan.\nHear me, O prince, my noble-hearted prince!\nCould I but blindly touch them with my hands\nI’d think they still were mine, as when I saw.\n[ANTIGONE and ISMENE are led in.]\nWhat say I? can it be my pretty ones\nWhose sobs I hear? Has Creon pitied me\nAnd sent me my two darlings? Can this be?\nCREON.\n’Tis true; ’twas I procured thee this delight,\nKnowing the joy they were to thee of old.\nOEDIPUS.\nGod speed thee! and as meed for bringing them\nMay Providence deal with thee kindlier\nThan it has dealt with me! O children mine,\nWhere are ye? Let me clasp you with these hands,\nA brother’s hands, a father’s; hands that made\nLack-luster sockets of his once bright eyes;\nHands of a man who blindly, recklessly,\nBecame your sire by her from whom he sprang.\nThough I cannot behold you, I must weep\nIn thinking of the evil days to come,\nThe slights and wrongs that men will put upon you.\nWhere’er ye go to feast or festival,\nNo merrymaking will it prove for you,\nBut oft abashed in tears ye will return.\nAnd when ye come to marriageable years,\nWhere’s the bold wooers who will jeopardize\nTo take unto himself such disrepute\nAs to my children’s children still must cling,\nFor what of infamy is lacking here?\n“Their father slew his father, sowed the seed\nWhere he himself was gendered, and begat\nThese maidens at the source wherefrom he sprang.”\nSuch are the gibes that men will cast at you.\nWho then will wed you? None, I ween, but ye\nMust pine, poor maids, in single barrenness.\nO Prince, Menoeceus’ son, to thee, I turn,\nWith the it rests to father them, for we\nTheir natural parents, both of us, are lost.\nO leave them not to wander poor, unwed,\nThy kin, nor let them share my low estate.\nO pity them so young, and but for thee\nAll destitute. Thy hand upon it, Prince.\nTo you, my children I had much to say,\nWere ye but ripe to hear. Let this suffice:\nPray ye may find some home and live content,\nAnd may your lot prove happier than your sire’s.\nCREON.\nThou hast had enough of weeping; pass within.\nOEDIPUS.\nI must obey,\nThough ’tis grievous.\nCREON.\nWeep not, everything must have its day.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell I go, but on conditions.\nCREON.\nWhat thy terms for going, say.\nOEDIPUS.\nSend me from the land an exile.\nCREON.\nAsk this of the gods, not me.\nOEDIPUS.\nBut I am the gods’ abhorrence.\nCREON.\nThen they soon will grant thy plea.\nOEDIPUS.\nLead me hence, then, I am willing.\nCREON.\nCome, but let thy children go.\nOEDIPUS.\nRob me not of these my children!\nCREON.\nCrave not mastery in all,\nFor the mastery that raised thee was thy bane and wrought thy fall.\nCHORUS.\nLook ye, countrymen and Thebans, this is Oedipus the great,\nHe who knew the Sphinx’s riddle and was mightiest in our state.\nWho of all our townsmen gazed not on his fame with envious eyes?\nNow, in what a sea of troubles sunk and overwhelmed he lies!\nTherefore wait to see life’s ending ere thou count one mortal blest;\nWait till free from pain and sorrow he has gained his final rest.",
