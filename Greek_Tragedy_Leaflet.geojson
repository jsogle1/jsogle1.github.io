    "content":"ANTIGONE\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nAntigone, daughter of Oedipus, the late king of Thebes, in defiance of Creon who rules in his stead, resolves to bury her brother Polyneices, slain in his attack on Thebes. She is caught in the act by Creon’s watchmen and brought before the king. She justifies her action, asserting that she was bound to obey the eternal laws of right and wrong in spite of any human ordinance. Creon, unrelenting, condemns her to be immured in a rock-hewn chamber. His son Haemon, to whom Antigone is betrothed, pleads in vain for her life and threatens to die with her. Warned by the seer Teiresias Creon repents him and hurries to release Antigone from her rocky prison. But he is too late: he finds lying side by side Antigone who had hanged herself and Haemon who also has perished by his own hand. Returning to the palace he sees within the dead body of his queen who on learning of her son’s death has stabbed herself to the heart.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE—daughters of Oedipus and sisters of Polyneices and Eteocles.\nCREON, King of Thebes.\nHAEMON, Son of Creon, betrothed to Antigone.\nEURYDICE, wife of Creon.\nTEIRESIAS, the prophet.\nCHORUS, of Theban elders.\nA WATCHMAN\nA MESSENGER\nA SECOND MESSENGER\nANTIGONE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE before the Palace gates.\nANTIGONE.\nIsmene, sister of my blood and heart,\nSee’st thou how Zeus would in our lives fulfill\nThe weird of Oedipus, a world of woes!\nFor what of pain, affliction, outrage, shame,\nIs lacking in our fortunes, thine and mine?\nAnd now this proclamation of today\nMade by our Captain-General to the State,\nWhat can its purport be? Didst hear and heed,\nOr art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?\nISMENE.\nTo me, Antigone, no word of friends\nHas come, or glad or grievous, since we twain\nWere reft of our two brethren in one day\nBy double fratricide; and since i’ the night\nOur Argive leaguers fled, no later news\nHas reached me, to inspirit or deject.\nANTIGONE.\nI know ’twas so, and therefore summoned thee\nBeyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.\nISMENE.\nWhat is it? Some dark secret stirs thy breast.\nANTIGONE.\nWhat but the thought of our two brothers dead,\nThe one by Creon graced with funeral rites,\nThe other disappointed? Eteocles\nHe hath consigned to earth (as fame reports)\nWith obsequies that use and wont ordain,\nSo gracing him among the dead below.\nBut Polyneices, a dishonored corse,\n(So by report the royal edict runs)\nNo man may bury him or make lament—\nMust leave him tombless and unwept, a feast\nFor kites to scent afar and swoop upon.\nSuch is the edict (if report speak true)\nOf Creon, our most noble Creon, aimed\nAt thee and me, aye me too; and anon\nHe will be here to promulgate, for such\nAs have not heard, his mandate; ’tis in sooth\nNo passing humor, for the edict says\nWhoe’er transgresses shall be stoned to death.\nSo stands it with us; now ’tis thine to show\nIf thou art worthy of thy blood or base.\nISMENE.\nBut how, my rash, fond sister, in such case\nCan I do anything to make or mar?\nANTIGONE.\nSay, wilt thou aid me and abet? Decide.\nISMENE.\nIn what bold venture? What is in thy thought?\nANTIGONE.\nLend me a hand to bear the corpse away.\nISMENE.\nWhat, bury him despite the interdict?\nANTIGONE.\nMy brother, and, though thou deny him, thine\nNo man shall say that I betrayed a brother.\nISMENE.\nWilt thou persist, though Creon has forbid?\nANTIGONE.\nWhat right has he to keep me from my own?\nISMENE.\nBethink thee, sister, of our father’s fate,\nAbhorred, dishonored, self-convinced of sin,\nBlinded, himself his executioner.\nThink of his mother-wife (ill sorted names)\nDone by a noose herself had twined to death\nAnd last, our hapless brethren in one day,\nBoth in a mutual destiny involved,\nSelf-slaughtered, both the slayer and the slain.\nBethink thee, sister, we are left alone;\nShall we not perish wretchedest of all,\nIf in defiance of the law we cross\nA monarch’s will?—weak women, think of that,\nNot framed by nature to contend with men.\nRemember this too that the stronger rules;\nWe must obey his orders, these or worse.\nTherefore I plead compulsion and entreat\nThe dead to pardon. I perforce obey\nThe powers that be. ’Tis foolishness, I ween,\nTo overstep in aught the golden mean.\nANTIGONE.\nI urge no more; nay, wert thou willing still,\nI would not welcome such a fellowship.\nGo thine own way; myself will bury him.\nHow sweet to die in such employ, to rest,—\nSister and brother linked in love’s embrace—\nA sinless sinner, banned awhile on earth,\nBut by the dead commended; and with them\nI shall abide for ever. As for thee,\nScorn, if thou wilt, the eternal laws of Heaven.\nISMENE.\nI scorn them not, but to defy the State\nOr break her ordinance I have no skill.\nANTIGONE.\nA specious pretext. I will go alone\nTo lap my dearest brother in the grave.\nISMENE.\nMy poor, fond sister, how I fear for thee!\nANTIGONE.\nO waste no fears on me; look to thyself.\nISMENE.\nAt least let no man know of thine intent,\nBut keep it close and secret, as will I.\nANTIGONE.\nO tell it, sister; I shall hate thee more\nIf thou proclaim it not to all the town.\nISMENE.\nThou hast a fiery soul for numbing work.\nANTIGONE.\nI pleasure those whom I would liefest please.\nISMENE.\nIf thou succeed; but thou art doomed to fail.\nANTIGONE.\nWhen strength shall fail me, yes, but not before.\nISMENE.\nBut, if the venture’s hopeless, why essay?\nANTIGONE.\nSister, forbear, or I shall hate thee soon,\nAnd the dead man will hate thee too, with cause.\nSay I am mad and give my madness rein\nTo wreck itself; the worst that can befall\nIs but to die an honorable death.\nISMENE.\nHave thine own way then; ’tis a mad endeavor,\nYet to thy lovers thou art dear as ever.\n[Exeunt]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nSunbeam, of all that ever dawn upon\nOur seven-gated Thebes the brightest ray,\nO eye of golden day,\nHow fair thy light o’er Dirce’s fountain shone,\nSpeeding upon their headlong homeward course,\nFar quicker than they came, the Argive force;\nPutting to flight\nThe argent shields, the host with scutcheons white.\nAgainst our land the proud invader came\nTo vindicate fell Polyneices’ claim.\nLike to an eagle swooping low,\nOn pinions white as new fall’n snow.\nWith clanging scream, a horsetail plume his crest,\nThe aspiring lord of Argos onward pressed.\n(Ant. 1)\nHovering around our city walls he waits,\nHis spearmen raven at our seven gates.\nBut ere a torch our crown of towers could burn,\nEre they had tasted of our blood, they turn\nForced by the Dragon; in their rear\nThe din of Ares panic-struck they hear.\nFor Zeus who hates the braggart’s boast\nBeheld that gold-bespangled host;\nAs at the goal the paean they upraise,\nHe struck them with his forked lightning blaze.\n(Str. 2)\nTo earthy from earth rebounding, down he crashed;\nThe fire-brand from his impious hand was dashed,\nAs like a Bacchic reveler on he came,\nOutbreathing hate and flame,\nAnd tottered. Elsewhere in the field,\nHere, there, great Area like a war-horse wheeled;\nBeneath his car down thrust\nOur foemen bit the dust.\nSeven captains at our seven gates\nThundered; for each a champion waits,\nEach left behind his armor bright,\nTrophy for Zeus who turns the fight;\nSave two alone, that ill-starred pair\nOne mother to one father bare,\nWho lance in rest, one ’gainst the other\nDrave, and both perished, brother slain by brother.\n(Ant. 2)\nNow Victory to Thebes returns again\nAnd smiles upon her chariot-circled plain.\nNow let feast and festal should\nMemories of war blot out.\nLet us to the temples throng,\nDance and sing the live night long.\nGod of Thebes, lead thou the round.\nBacchus, shaker of the ground!\nLet us end our revels here;\nLo! Creon our new lord draws near,\nCrowned by this strange chance, our king.\nWhat, I marvel, pondering?\nWhy this summons? Wherefore call\nUs, his elders, one and all,\nBidding us with him debate,\nOn some grave concern of State?\n[Enter CREON]\nCREON.\nElders, the gods have righted one again\nOur storm-tossed ship of state, now safe in port.\nBut you by special summons I convened\nAs my most trusted councilors; first, because\nI knew you loyal to Laius of old;\nAgain, when Oedipus restored our State,\nBoth while he ruled and when his rule was o’er,\nYe still were constant to the royal line.\nNow that his two sons perished in one day,\nBrother by brother murderously slain,\nBy right of kinship to the Princes dead,\nI claim and hold the throne and sovereignty.\nYet ’tis no easy matter to discern\nThe temper of a man, his mind and will,\nTill he be proved by exercise of power;\nAnd in my case, if one who reigns supreme\nSwerve from the highest policy, tongue-tied\nBy fear of consequence, that man I hold,\nAnd ever held, the basest of the base.\nAnd I contemn the man who sets his friend\nBefore his country. For myself, I call\nTo witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,\nIf I perceive some mischievous design\nTo sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;\nNor would I reckon as my private friend\nA public foe, well knowing that the State\nIs the good ship that holds our fortunes all:\nFarewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.\nSuch is the policy by which I seek\nTo serve the Commons and conformably\nI have proclaimed an edict as concerns\nThe sons of Oedipus; Eteocles\nWho in his country’s battle fought and fell,\nThe foremost champion—duly bury him\nWith all observances and ceremonies\nThat are the guerdon of the heroic dead.\nBut for the miscreant exile who returned\nMinded in flames and ashes to blot out\nHis father’s city and his father’s gods,\nAnd glut his vengeance with his kinsmen’s blood,\nOr drag them captive at his chariot wheels—\nFor Polyneices ’tis ordained that none\nShall give him burial or make mourn for him,\nBut leave his corpse unburied, to be meat\nFor dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.\nSo am I purposed; never by my will\nShall miscreants take precedence of true men,\nBut all good patriots, alive or dead,\nShall be by me preferred and honored.\nCHORUS.\nSon of Menoeceus, thus thou will’st to deal\nWith him who loathed and him who loved our State.\nThy word is law; thou canst dispose of us\nThe living, as thou will’st, as of the dead.\nCREON.\nSee then ye execute what I ordain.\nCHORUS.\nOn younger shoulders lay this grievous charge.\nCREON.\nFear not, I’ve posted guards to watch the corpse.\nCHORUS.\nWhat further duty would’st thou lay on us?\nCREON.\nNot to connive at disobedience.\nCHORUS.\nNo man is mad enough to court his death.\nCREON.\nThe penalty is death: yet hope of gain\nHath lured men to their ruin oftentimes.\n[Enter GUARD]\nGUARD.\nMy lord, I will not make pretense to pant\nAnd puff as some light-footed messenger.\nIn sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought\nMade many a halt and turned and turned again;\nFor conscience plied her spur and curb by turns.\n“Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?”\nShe whispered. Then again, “If Creon learn\nThis from another, thou wilt rue it worse.”\nThus leisurely I hastened on my road;\nMuch thought extends a furlong to a league.\nBut in the end the forward voice prevailed,\nTo face thee. I will speak though I say nothing.\nFor plucking courage from despair methought,\n‘Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.’\nCREON.\nWhat is thy news? Why this despondency?\nGUARD.\nLet me premise a word about myself?\nI neither did the deed nor saw it done,\nNor were it just that I should come to harm.\nCREON.\nThou art good at parry, and canst fence about\nSome matter of grave import, as is plain.\nGUARD.\nThe bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.\nCREON.\nThen, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.\nGUARD.\nWell, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone\nE’en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,\nPerformed the proper ritual—and was gone.\nCREON.\nWhat say’st thou? Who hath dared to do this thing?\nGUARD.\nI cannot tell, for there was ne’er a trace\nOf pick or mattock—hard unbroken ground,\nWithout a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,\nNo sign that human hands had been at work.\nWhen the first sentry of the morning watch\nGave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.\nThe corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,\nBut strewn with dust, as if by one who sought\nTo avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:\nOf hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.\nThereat arose an angry war of words;\nGuard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,\nFor none was there to part us, each in turn\nSuspected, but the guilt brought home to none,\nFrom lack of evidence. We challenged each\nThe ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,\nOr pass through fire, affirming on our oath\nOur innocence—we neither did the deed\nOurselves, nor know who did or compassed it.\nOur quest was at a standstill, when one spake\nAnd bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,\nFor there was no gainsaying him nor way\nTo escape perdition: Yeareboundtotell\nTheKing,yecannothideit; so he spake.\nAnd he convinced us all; so lots were cast,\nAnd I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.\nSo here I am unwilling and withal\nUnwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.\nCHORUS.\nI had misgivings from the first, my liege,\nOf something more than natural at work.\nCREON.\nO cease, you vex me with your babblement;\nI am like to think you dote in your old age.\nIs it not arrant folly to pretend\nThat gods would have a thought for this dead man?\nDid they forsooth award him special grace,\nAnd as some benefactor bury him,\nWho came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,\nTo sack their shrines, to desolate their land,\nAnd scout their ordinances? Or perchance\nThe gods bestow their favors on the bad.\nNo! no! I have long noted malcontents\nWho wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,\nMisliking these my orders, and my rule.\n’Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards\nBy bribes. Of evils current upon earth\nThe worst is money. Money ’tis that sacks\nCities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;\nWarps and seduces native innocence,\nAnd breeds a habit of dishonesty.\nBut they who sold themselves shall find their greed\nOut-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.\nYea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,\nBy Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring\nBefore my presence here the very man\nWho carried out this lawless burial,\nDeath for your punishment shall not suffice.\nHanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make\nConfession of this outrage. This will teach you\nWhat practices are like to serve your turn.\nThere are some villainies that bring no gain.\nFor by dishonesty the few may thrive,\nThe many come to ruin and disgrace.\nGUARD.\nMay I not speak, or must I turn and go\nWithout a word?—\nCREON.\nBegone! canst thou not see\nThat e’en this question irks me?\nGUARD.\nWhere, my lord?\nIs it thy ears that suffer, or thy heart?\nCREON.\nWhy seek to probe and find the seat of pain?\nGUARD.\nI gall thine ears—this miscreant thy mind.\nCREON.\nWhat an inveterate babbler! get thee gone!\nGUARD.\nBabbler perchance, but innocent of the crime.\nCREON.\nTwice guilty, having sold thy soul for gain.\nGUARD.\nAlas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.\nCREON.\nGo, quibble with thy reason. If thou fail’st\nTo find these malefactors, thou shalt own\nThe wages of ill-gotten gains is death.\n[Exit CREON]\nGUARD.\nI pray he may be found. But caught or not\n(And fortune must determine that) thou never\nShalt see me here returning; that is sure.\nFor past all hope or thought I have escaped,\nAnd for my safety owe the gods much thanks.\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nMany wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;\nOver the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,\nThrough the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;\nAnd the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay\nEver he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,\nWith breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.\n(Ant. 1)\nThe light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood\nHe traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.\nMaster of cunning he: the savage bull, and the hart\nWho roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;\nAnd the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.\n(Str. 2)\nSpeech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,\nHe hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly\nAnd the nipping airs that freeze, ’neath the open winter sky.\nHe hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;\nSafe whate’er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.\n(Ant. 2)\nPassing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,\nThat guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.\nIf he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State\nProudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate\nWhoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;\nNe’er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.\nWhat strange vision meets my eyes,\nFills me with a wild surprise?\nSure I know her, sure ’tis she,\nThe maid Antigone.\nHapless child of hapless sire,\nDidst thou recklessly conspire,\nMadly brave the King’s decree?\nTherefore are they haling thee?\n[Enter GUARD bringing ANTIGONE]\nGUARD.\nHere is the culprit taken in the act\nOf giving burial. But where’s the King?\nCHORUS.\nThere from the palace he returns in time.\n[Enter CREON]\nCREON.\nWhy is my presence timely? What has chanced?\nGUARD.\nNo man, my lord, should make a vow, for if\nHe ever swears he will not do a thing,\nHis afterthoughts belie his first resolve.\nWhen from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled\nI sware thou wouldst not see me here again;\nBut the wild rapture of a glad surprise\nIntoxicates, and so I’m here forsworn.\nAnd here’s my prisoner, caught in the very act,\nDecking the grave. No lottery this time;\nThis prize is mine by right of treasure-trove.\nSo take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.\nShe’s thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim\nHence to depart well quit of all these ills.\nCREON.\nSay, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?\nGUARD.\nBurying the man. There’s nothing more to tell.\nCREON.\nHast thou thy wits? Or know’st thou what thou say’st?\nGUARD.\nI saw this woman burying the corpse\nAgainst thy orders. Is that clear and plain?\nCREON.\nBut how was she surprised and caught in the act?\nGUARD.\nIt happened thus. No sooner had we come,\nDriven from thy presence by those awful threats,\nThan straight we swept away all trace of dust,\nAnd bared the clammy body. Then we sat\nHigh on the ridge to windward of the stench,\nWhile each man kept he fellow alert and rated\nRoundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.\nSo all night long we watched, until the sun\nStood high in heaven, and his blazing beams\nSmote us. A sudden whirlwind then upraised\nA cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,\nAnd swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,\nAnd shook the firmament. We closed our eyes\nAnd waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.\nAt last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.\nA piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,\nAs when the mother bird beholds her nest\nRobbed of its nestlings; even so the maid\nWailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,\nAnd cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.\nAnon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,\nThen, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,\nThrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.\nWe at the sight swooped down on her and seized\nOur quarry. Undismayed she stood, and when\nWe taxed her with the former crime and this,\nShe disowned nothing. I was glad—and grieved;\nFor ’tis most sweet to ’scape oneself scot-free,\nAnd yet to bring disaster to a friend\nIs grievous. Take it all in all, I deem\nA man’s first duty is to serve himself.\nCREON.\nSpeak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,\nDoes thou plead guilty or deny the deed?\nANTIGONE.\nGuilty.

But repeat your tale\nTo one not unacquaint with misery.\nMESSENGER.\nDear mistress, I was there and will relate\nThe perfect truth, omitting not one word.\nWhy should we gloze and flatter, to be proved\nLiars hereafter? Truth is ever best.\nWell, in attendance on my liege, your lord,\nI crossed the plain to its utmost margin, where\nThe corse of Polyneices, gnawn and mauled,\nWas lying yet. We offered first a prayer\nTo Pluto and the goddess of cross-ways,\nWith contrite hearts, to deprecate their ire.\nThen laved with lustral waves the mangled corse,\nLaid it on fresh-lopped branches, lit a pyre,\nAnd to his memory piled a mighty mound\nOf mother earth. Then to the caverned rock,\nThe bridal chamber of the maid and Death,\nWe sped, about to enter. But a guard\nHeard from that godless shrine a far shrill wail,\nAnd ran back to our lord to tell the news.\nBut as he nearer drew a hollow sound\nOf lamentation to the King was borne.\nHe groaned and uttered then this bitter plaint:\n“Am I a prophet? miserable me!\nIs this the saddest path I ever trod?\n’Tis my son’s voice that calls me. On press on,\nMy henchmen, haste with double speed to the tomb\nWhere rocks down-torn have made a gap, look in\nAnd tell me if in truth I recognize\nThe voice of Haemon or am heaven-deceived.”\nSo at the bidding of our distraught lord\nWe looked, and in the craven’s vaulted gloom\nI saw the maiden lying strangled there,\nA noose of linen twined about her neck;\nAnd hard beside her, clasping her cold form,\nHer lover lay bewailing his dead bride\nDeath-wedded, and his father’s cruelty.\nWhen the King saw him, with a terrible groan\nHe moved towards him, crying, “O my son\nWhat hast thou done? What ailed thee? What mischance\nHas reft thee of thy reason? O come forth,\nCome forth, my son; thy father supplicates.”\nBut the son glared at him with tiger eyes,\nSpat in his face, and then, without a word,\nDrew his two-hilted sword and smote, but missed\nHis father flying backwards. Then the boy,\nWroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent\nFell on his sword and drove it through his side\nHome, but yet breathing clasped in his lax arms\nThe maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined\nWith his expiring gasps. So there they lay\nTwo corpses, one in death. His marriage rites\nAre consummated in the halls of Death:\nA witness that of ills whate’er befall\nMortals’ unwisdom is the worst of all.\n[Exit EURYDICE]\nCHORUS.\nWhat makest thou of this?

    "content":"OEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nOedipus, the blind and banished King of Thebes, has come in his wanderings to Colonus, a deme of Athens, led by his daughter Antigone. He sits to rest on a rock just within a sacred grove of the Furies and is bidden depart by a passing native. But Oedipus, instructed by an oracle that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to stir, and the stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the Chorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at first the blind beggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are horror-striken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will confer on the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus. From Theseus Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil; the benefits that will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs having promised to aid and befriend him. No sooner has he gone than Creon enters with an armed guard who seize Antigone and carry her off (Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured) and he is about to lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard the tumult, hurries up and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to detain him till he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the next scene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs Oedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon wishes to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father’s forgiveness and blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to the side that Oedipus espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and invokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of thunder is heard, and as peal follows peal, Oedipus is aware that his hour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus. Self-guided he leads the way to the spot where death should overtake him, attended by Theseus and his daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell, and what followed none but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports) for the gods took him.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nOEDIPUS, banished King of Thebes.\nANTIGONE, his daughter.\nISMENE, his daughter.\nTHESEUS, King of Athens.\nCREON, brother of Jocasta, now reigning at Thebes.\nPOLYNEICES, elder son of Oedipus.\nSTRANGER, a native of Colonus.\nMESSENGER, an attendant of Theseus.\nCHORUS, citizens of Colonus.\nScene: In front of the grove of the Eumenides.\nOEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nEnter the blind OEDIPUS led by his daughter, ANTIGONE.\nOEDIPUS.\nChild of an old blind sire, Antigone,\nWhat region, say, whose city have we reached?\nWho will provide today with scanted dole\nThis wanderer? ’Tis little that he craves,\nAnd less obtains—that less enough for me;\nFor I am taught by suffering to endure,\nAnd the long years that have grown old with me,\nAnd last not least, by true nobility.\nMy daughter, if thou seest a resting place\nOn common ground or by some sacred grove,\nStay me and set me down.

The one\nSince first she grew from girlish feebleness\nTo womanhood has been the old man’s guide\nAnd shared my weary wandering, roaming oft\nHungry and footsore through wild forest ways,\nIn drenching rains and under scorching suns,\nCareless herself of home and ease, if so\nHer sire might have her tender ministry.\nAnd thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,\nEluding the Cadmeians’ vigilance,\nTo bring thy father all the oracles\nConcerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself\nMy faithful lieger, when they banished me.\nAnd now what mission summons thee from home,\nWhat news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?\nThis much I know, thou com’st not empty-handed,\nWithout a warning of some new alarm.\nISMENE.\nThe toil and trouble, father, that I bore\nTo find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,\nI spare thee; surely ’twere a double pain\nTo suffer, first in act and then in telling;\n’Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons\nI come to tell thee.

These two maids\nTheir sisters, girls, gave all their sex could give,\nFood and safe harborage and filial care;\nWhile their two brethren sacrificed their sire\nFor lust of power and sceptred sovereignty.\nNo! me they ne’er shall win for an ally,\nNor will this Theban kingship bring them gain;\nThat know I from this maiden’s oracles,\nAnd those old prophecies concerning me,\nWhich Phoebus now at length has brought to pass.\nCome Creon then, come all the mightiest\nIn Thebes to seek me; for if ye my friends,\nChampioned by those dread Powers indigenous,\nEspouse my cause; then for the State ye gain\nA great deliverer, for my foemen bane.\nCHORUS.\nOur pity, Oedipus, thou needs must move,\nThou and these maidens; and the stronger plea\nThou urgest, as the savior of our land,\nDisposes me to counsel for thy weal.\nOEDIPUS.\nAid me, kind sirs; I will do all you bid.\nCHORUS.\nFirst make atonement to the deities,\nWhose grove by trespass thou didst first profane.\nOEDIPUS.\nAfter what manner, stranger?

Having come\nUnto a State that champions right and asks\nFor every action warranty of law,\nThou hast set aside the custom of the land,\nAnd like some freebooter art carrying off\nWhat plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth\nThou thoughtest this a city without men,\nOr manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.\nYet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;\nThebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,\nNor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou\nWert robbing me—aye and the gods to boot,\nHaling by force their suppliants, poor maids.\nWere I on Theban soil, to prosecute\nThe justest claim imaginable, I\nWould never wrest by violence my own\nWithout sanction of your State or King;\nI should behave as fits an outlander\nLiving amongst a foreign folk, but thou\nShamest a city that deserves it not,\nEven thine own, and plentitude of years\nHave made of thee an old man and a fool.\nTherefore again I charge thee as before,\nSee that the maidens are restored at once,\nUnless thou would’st continue here by force\nAnd not by choice a sojourner; so much\nI tell thee home and what I say, I mean.\nCHORUS.\nThy case is perilous; though by birth and race\nThou should’st be just, thou plainly doest wrong.\nCREON.\nNot deeming this city void of men\nOr counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say’st\nI did what I have done; rather I thought\nYour people were not like to set such store\nby kin of mine and keep them ’gainst my will.\nNor would they harbor, so I stood assured,\nA godless parricide, a reprobate\nConvicted of incestuous marriage ties.\nFor on her native hill of Ares here\n(I knew your far-famed Areopagus)\nSits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk\nTo stay within your borders. In that faith\nI hunted down my quarry; and e’en then\nI had refrained but for the curses dire\nWherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:\nSuch wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.\nAnger has no old age but only death;\nThe dead alone can feel no touch of spite.\nSo thou must work thy will; my cause is just\nBut weak without allies; yet will I try,\nOld as I am, to answer deeds with deeds.\nOEDIPUS.\nO shameless railer, think’st thou this abuse\nDefames my grey hairs rather than thine own?\nMurder and incest, deeds of horror, all\nThou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,\nNo willing sinner; so it pleased the gods\nWrath haply with my sinful race of old,\nSince thou could’st find no sin in me myself\nFor which in retribution I was doomed\nTo trespass thus against myself and mine.\nAnswer me now, if by some oracle\nMy sire was destined to a bloody end\nBy a son’s hand, can this reflect on me,\nMe then unborn, begotten by no sire,\nConceived in no mother’s womb? And if\nWhen born to misery, as born I was,\nI met my sire, not knowing whom I met\nor what I did, and slew him, how canst thou\nWith justice blame the all-unconscious hand?\nAnd for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,\nSeeing she was thy sister, to extort\nFrom me the story of her marriage, such\nA marriage as I straightway will proclaim.\nFor I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech\nHas broken all the bonds of reticence.\nShe was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;\nI knew it not, nor she; and she my mother\nBare children to the son whom she had borne,\nA birth of shame. But this at least I know\nWittingly thou aspersest her and me;\nBut I unwitting wed, unwilling speak.\nNay neither in this marriage or this deed\nWhich thou art ever casting in my teeth—\nA murdered sire—shall I be held to blame.\nCome, answer me one question, if thou canst:\nIf one should presently attempt thy life,\nWould’st thou, O man of justice, first inquire\nIf the assassin was perchance thy sire,\nOr turn upon him? As thou lov’st thy life,\nOn thy aggressor thou would’st turn, no stay\nDebating, if the law would bear thee out.\nSuch was my case, and such the pass whereto\nThe gods reduced me; and methinks my sire,\nCould he come back to life, would not dissent.\nYet thou, for just thou art not, but a man\nWho sticks at nothing, if it serve his plea,\nReproachest me with this before these men.\nIt serves thy turn to laud great Theseus’ name,\nAnd Athens as a wisely governed State;\nYet in thy flatteries one thing is to seek:\nIf any land knows how to pay the gods\nTheir proper rites, ’tis Athens most of all.\nThis is the land whence thou wast fain to steal\nTheir aged suppliant and hast carried off\nMy daughters. Therefore to yon goddesses,\nI turn, adjure them and invoke their aid\nTo champion my cause, that thou mayest learn\nWhat is the breed of men who guard this State.\nCHORUS.\nAn honest man, my liege, one sore bestead\nBy fortune, and so worthy our support.\nTHESEUS.\nEnough of words; the captors speed amain,\nWhile we the victims stand debating here.\nCREON.\nWhat would’st thou?

By a god-sent, painless doom, poor soul?\nMESSENGER.\nThy question hits the marvel of the tale.\nHow he moved hence, you saw him and must know;\nWithout a friend to lead the way, himself\nGuiding us all. So having reached the abrupt\nEarth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,\nHe paused at one of the converging paths,\nHard by the rocky basin which records\nThe pact of Theseus and Peirithous.\nBetwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,\nThe hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,\nMidway he sat and loosed his beggar’s weeds;\nThen calling to his daughters bade them fetch\nOf running water, both to wash withal\nAnd make libation; so they clomb the steep;\nAnd in brief space brought what their father bade,\nThen laved and dressed him with observance due.\nBut when he had his will in everything,\nAnd no desire was left unsatisfied,\nIt thundered from the netherworld; the maids\nShivered, and crouching at their father’s knees\nWept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.\nHe, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,\nFolded his arms about them both and said,\n“My children, ye will lose your sire today,\nFor all of me has perished, and no more\nHave ye to bear your long, long ministry;\nA heavy load, I know, and yet one word\nWipes out all score of tribulations—love.\nAnd love from me ye had—from no man more;\nBut now must live without me all your days.”\nSo clinging to each other sobbed and wept\nFather and daughters both, but when at last\nTheir mourning had an end and no wail rose,\nA moment there was silence; suddenly\nA voice that summoned him; with sudden dread\nThe hair of all stood up and all were ’mazed;\nFor the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.\n“Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?\nToo long, too long thy passing is delayed.”\nBut when he heard the summons of the god,\nHe prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when\nThe Prince came nearer: “O my friend,” he cried,\n“Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand—\nAnd, daughters, give him yours—and promise me\nThou never wilt forsake them, but do all\nThat time and friendship prompt in their behoof.”\nAnd he of his nobility repressed\nHis tears and swore to be their constant friend.\nThis promise given, Oedipus put forth\nBlind hands and laid them on his children, saying,\n“O children, prove your true nobility\nAnd hence depart nor seek to witness sights\nUnlawful or to hear unlawful words.\nNay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,\nOur ruler, to behold what next shall hap.”\nSo we all heard him speak, and weeping sore\nWe companied the maidens on their way.\nAfter brief space we looked again, and lo\nThe man was gone, evanished from our eyes;\nOnly the king we saw with upraised hand\nShading his eyes as from some awful sight,\nThat no man might endure to look upon.\nA moment later, and we saw him bend\nIn prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.\nBut by what doom the stranger met his end\nNo man save Theseus knoweth. For there fell\nNo fiery bold that reft him in that hour,\nNor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.\nIt was a messenger from heaven, or else\nSome gentle, painless cleaving of earth’s base;\nFor without wailing or disease or pain\nHe passed away—and end most marvelous.\nAnd if to some my tale seems foolishness\nI am content that such could count me fool.\nCHORUS.\nWhere are the maids and their attendant friends?\nMESSENGER.\nThey cannot be far off; the approaching sound\nOf lamentation tells they come this way.\n[Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE]\nANTIGONE.\n(Str. 1)\nWoe, woe! on this sad day\nWe sisters of one blasted stock\nmust bow beneath the shock,\nMust weep and weep the curse that lay\nOn him our sire, for whom\nIn life, a life-long world of care\n’Twas ours to bear,\nIn death must face the gloom\nThat wraps his tomb.\nWhat tongue can tell\nThat sight ineffable?\nCHORUS.\nWhat mean ye, maidens?\nANTIGONE.\nAll is but surmise.\nCHORUS.\nIs he then gone?\nANTIGONE.\nGone as ye most might wish.\nNot in battle or sea storm,\nBut reft from sight,\nBy hands invisible borne\nTo viewless fields of night.\nAh me! on us too night has come,\nThe night of mourning. Wither roam\nO’er land or sea in our distress\nEating the bread of bitterness?\nISMENE.\nI know not. O that Death\nMight nip my breath,\nAnd let me share my aged father’s fate.\nI cannot live a life thus desolate.\nCHORUS.\nBest of daughters, worthy pair,\nWhat heaven brings ye needs must bear,\nFret no more ’gainst Heaven’s will;\nFate hath dealt with you not ill.\nANTIGONE.\n(Ant. 1)\nLove can turn past pain to bliss,\nWhat seemed bitter now is sweet.\nAh me! that happy toil is sweet.\nThe guidance of those dear blind feet.\nDear father, wrapt for aye in nether gloom,\nE’en in the tomb\nNever shalt thou lack of love repine,\nHer love and mine.\nCHORUS.\nHis fate—\nANTIGONE.\nIs even as he planned.\nCHORUS.\nHow so?\nANTIGONE.\nHe died, so willed he, in a foreign land.\nLapped in kind earth he sleeps his long last sleep,\nAnd o’er his grave friends weep.\nHow great our lost these streaming eyes can tell,\nThis sorrow naught can quell.\nThou hadst thy wish ’mid strangers thus to die,\nBut I, ah me, not by.\nISMENE.\nAlas, my sister, what new fate\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * *\nBefalls us orphans desolate?\nCHORUS.\nHis end was blessed; therefore, children, stay\nYour sorrow. Man is born to fate a prey.\nANTIGONE.\n(Str. 2)\nSister, let us back again.\nISMENE.\nWhy return?\nANTIGONE.\nMy soul is fain—\nISMENE.\nIs fain?\nANTIGONE.\nTo see the earthy bed.\nISMENE.\nSayest thou?\nANTIGONE.\nWhere our sire is laid.\nISMENE.\nNay, thou can’st not, dost not see—\nANTIGONE.\nSister, wherefore wroth with me?\nISMENE.\nKnow’st not—beside—\nANTIGONE.\nMore must I hear?\nISMENE.\nTombless he died, none near.\nANTIGONE.\nLead me thither; slay me there.\nISMENE.\nHow shall I unhappy fare,\nFriendless, helpless, how drag on\nA life of misery alone?\nCHORUS.\n(Ant. 2)\nFear not, maids—\nANTIGONE.\nAh, whither flee?\nCHORUS.\nRefuge hath been found.\nANTIGONE.\nFor me?\nCHORUS.\nWhere thou shalt be safe from harm.\nANTIGONE.\nI know it.\nCHORUS.\nWhy then this alarm?\nANTIGONE.\nHow again to get us home\nI know not.\nCHORUS.\nWhy then this roam?\nANTIGONE.\nTroubles whelm us—\nCHORUS.\nAs of yore.\nANTIGONE.\nWorse than what was worse before.\nCHORUS.\nSure ye are driven on the breakers’ surge.\nANTIGONE.\nAlas! we are.\nCHORUS.\nAlas! ’tis so.\nANTIGONE.\nAh whither turn, O Zeus? No ray\nOf hope to cheer the way\nWhereon the fates our desperate voyage urge.\n[Enter THESEUS]\nTHESEUS.\nDry your tears; when grace is shed\nOn the quick and on the dead\nBy dark Powers beneficent,\nOver-grief they would resent.\nANTIGONE.\nAegeus’ child, to thee we pray.\nTHESEUS.\nWhat the boon, my children, say.\nANTIGONE.\nWith our own eyes we fain would see\nOur father’s tomb.\nTHESEUS.\nThat may not be.\nANTIGONE.\nWhat say’st thou, King?\nTHESEUS.\nMy children, he\nCharged me straitly that no moral\nShould approach the sacred portal,\nOr greet with funeral litanies\nThe hidden tomb wherein he lies;\nSaying, “If thou keep’st my hest\nThou shalt hold thy realm at rest.”\nThe God of Oaths this promise heard,\nAnd to Zeus I pledged my word.\nANTIGONE.\nWell, if he would have it so,\nWe must yield. Then let us go\nBack to Thebes, if yet we may\nHeal this mortal feud and stay\nThe self-wrought doom\nThat drives our brothers to their tomb.\nTHESEUS.\nGo in peace; nor will I spare\nOught of toil and zealous care,\nBut on all your needs attend,\nGladdening in his grave my friend.\nCHORUS.\nWail no more, let sorrow rest,\nAll is ordered for the best.",
