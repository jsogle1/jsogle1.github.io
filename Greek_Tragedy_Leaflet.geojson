    "content":"AGAMEMNON\nCHARACTERS IN THE PLAY\nAGAMEMNON, son of Atreus and King of Argos and Mycenae; Commander-in-Chief of the Greek armies in the War against Troy.\nCLYTEMNESTRA, daughter of Tyndareus, sister of Helen; wife to Agamemnon.\nAIGISTHOS, son of Thyestes, cousin and blood-enemy to Agamemnon, lover to Clytemnestra.\nCASSANDRA, daughter of Priam, King of Troy, a prophetess; now slave to Agamemnon.\nA WATCHMAN.\nA HERALD.\nCHORUS of Argive Elders, faithful to AGAMEMNON.\nCHARACTERS MENTIONED IN THE PLAY\nMENELÂÜS, brother to Agamemnon, husband of Helen, and King of Sparta.\nThe two sons of Atreus are called the Atreidae.\nHELEN, most beautiful of women; daughter of Tyndareus, wife to MENELÂÜS; beloved and carried off by Paris.\nPARIS, son of Priam, King of Troy, lover of Helen.\nAlso called ALEXANDER.\nPRIAM, the aged King of Troy.\nThe Greeks are also referred to as Achaians, Argives, Danaans; Troy is also called Ilion.\nThe play was produced in the archonship of Philocles (458 B.C.). The first prize was won by Aeschylus with the “Agamemnon”, “Libation-Bearers”, “Eumenides”, and the Satyr Play “Proteus”.\nTHE AGAMEMNON\nThe Scene represents a space in front of the Palace of Agamemnon in Argos, with an Altar of Zeus in the centre and many other altars at the sides. On a high terrace of the roof stands a WATCHMAN. It is night.\nWATCHMAN.\nThis waste of year-long vigil I have prayed\nGod for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,\nAs sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae’s hall,\nTill well I know yon midnight festival\nOf swarming stars, and them that lonely go,\nBearers to man of summer and of snow,\nGreat lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.\nAnd still I await the sign, the beacon pyre\nThat bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame\nShouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim\nCleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passioned!\nAnd when I turn me to my bed—my bed\nDew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near\nCometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear\nBreathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain\nTo close may close too well to wake again;\nThink I perchance to sing or troll a tune\nFor medicine against sleep, the music soon\nChanges to sighing for the tale untold\nOf this house, not well mastered as of old.\nHowbeit, may God yet send us rest, and light\nThe flame of good news flashed across the night.\n[He is silent, watching. Suddenly at a distance in the night there is a glimmer of fire, increasing presently to a blaze.]\nHa!\nO kindler of the dark, O daylight birth\nOf dawn and dancing upon Argive earth\nFor this great end! All hail!—What ho, within!\nWhat ho! Bear word to Agamemnon’s queen\nTo rise, like dawn, and lift in answer strong\nTo this glad lamp her women’s triumph-song,\nIf verily, verily, Ilion’s citadel\nIs fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.\nAnd I myself will tread the dance before\nAll others; for my master’s dice I score\nGood, and mine own to-night three sixes plain.\n[Lights begin to show in the Palace.]\nOh, good or ill, my hand shall clasp again\nMy dear lord’s hand, returning! Beyond that\nI speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight\nAcross my tongue. But these stone walls know well,\nIf stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell.\nFor me, to him that knoweth I can yet\nSpeak; if another questions I forget.\n[Exit into the Palace. The women’s “Ololûgê” or triumph-cry, is heard within and then repeated again and again further off in the City. Handmaids and Attendants come from the Palace, bearing torches, with which they kindle incense on the altars. Among them comes CLYTEMNESTRA, who throws herself on her knees at the central Altar in an agony of prayer.]\n[Presently from the further side of the open space appear the CHORUS of ELDERS and move gradually into position in front of the Palace. The day begins to dawn.]\nCHORUS.\nTen years since Ilion’s righteous foes,\nThe Atreidae strong,\nMenelaüs and eke Agamemnon arose,\nTwo thrones, two sceptres, yoked of God;\nAnd a thousand galleys of Argos trod\nThe seas for the righting of wrong;\nAnd wrath of battle about them cried,\nAs vultures cry,\nWhose nest is plundered, and up they fly\nIn anguish lonely, eddying wide,\nGreat wings like oars in the waste of sky,\nTheir task gone from them, no more to keep\nWatch o’er the vulture babes asleep.\nBut One there is who heareth on high\nSome Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo—\nThat keen bird-throated suffering cry\nOf the stranger wronged in God’s own sky;\nAnd sendeth down, for the law transgressed,\nThe Wrath of the Feet that follow.\nSo Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend,\nZeus who Prevaileth, in after quest\nFor One Belovèd by Many Men\nOn Paris sent the Atreidae twain;\nYea, sent him dances before the end\nFor his bridal cheer,\nWrestlings heavy and limbs forespent\nFor Greek and Trojan, the knee earth-bent,\nThe bloody dust and the broken spear.\nHe knoweth, that which is here is here,\nAnd that which Shall Be followeth near;\nHe seeketh God with a great desire,\nHe heaps his gifts, he essays his pyre\nWith torch below and with oil above,\nWith tears, but never the wrath shall move\nOf the Altar cold that rejects his fire.\nWe saw the Avengers go that day,\nAnd they left us here; for our flesh is old\nAnd serveth not; and these staves uphold\nA strength like the strength of a child at play.\nFor the sap that springs in the young man’s hand\nAnd the valour of age, they have left the land.\nAnd the passing old, while the dead leaf blows\nAnd the old staff gropeth his three-foot way,\nWeak as a babe and alone he goes,\nA dream left wandering in the day.\n[Coming near the Central Altar they see CLYTEMNESTRA, who is still rapt in prayer.]\nBut thou, O daughter of Tyndareus,\nQueen Clytemnestra, what need? What news?\nWhat tale or tiding hath stirred thy mood\nTo send forth word upon all our ways\nFor incensed worship? Of every god\nThat guards the city, the deep, the high,\nGods of the mart, gods of the sky,\nThe altars blaze.\nOne here, one there,\nTo the skyey night the firebrands flare,\nDrunk with the soft and guileless spell\nOf balm of kings from the inmost cell.\nTell, O Queen, and reject us not,\nAll that can or that may be told,\nAnd healer be to this aching thought,\nWhich one time hovereth, evil-cold,\nAnd then from the fires thou kindlest\nWill Hope be kindled, and hungry Care\nFall back for a little while, nor tear\nThe heart that beateth below my breast.\n[CLYTEMNESTRA rises silently, as though unconscious of their presence, and goes into the House. The CHORUS take position and begin their first Stasimon, or Standing-song,]\nCHORUS.\n(The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young.)\nIt is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way given,\nTo men more strong,\n(For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven\nA spell, a Strength of Song:)\nHow the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided\nAbove all Greeks that are,\nWith avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided\nBy the Bird of War.\n’Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea,\nOne Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail,\nBy the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see;\nAnd they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew,\nYea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew.\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future.)\nAnd the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke\nTwain-tempered, knew\nThose fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke,\nReading the omen true.\n“At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down,\nYea, and before the wall\nViolent division the fulness of land and town\nShall waste withal;\nIf only God’s eye gloom not against our gates,\nAnd the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail.\nFor Pity lives, and those wingèd Hounds she hates,\nWhich tore in the Trembler’s body the unborn beast.\nAnd Artemis abhorreth the eagles’ feast.”\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(He prays to Artemis to grant the fulfilment of the Sign, but, as his vision increases, he is afraid and calls on Paian, the Healer, to hold her back.)\n“Thou beautiful One, thou tender lover\nOf the dewy breath of the Lion’s child;\nThou the delight, through den and cover,\nOf the young life at the breast of the wild,\nYet, oh, fulfill, fulfill The sign of the Eagles’ Kill!\nBe the vision accepted, albeit horrible….\nBut I-ê, I-ê! Stay her, O Paian, stay!\nFor lo, upon other evil her heart she setteth,\nLong wastes of wind, held ship and unventured sea,\nOn, on, till another Shedding of Blood be wrought:\nThey kill but feast not; they pray not; the law is broken;\nStrife in the flesh, and the bride she obeyeth not,\nAnd beyond, beyond, there abideth in wrath reawoken—\nIt plotteth, it haunteth the house, yea, it never forgetteth—\nWrath for a child to be.”\nSo Calchas, reading the wayside eagles’ sign,\nSpake to the Kings, blessings and words of bale;\nAnd like his song be thine,\nSorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail!\n(Such religion belongs to old and barbarous gods, and brings no peace. I turn to Zeus, who has shown man how to Learn by Suffering.)\nZeus! Zeus, whate’er He be,\nIf this name He love to hear\nThis He shall be called of me.\nSearching earth and sea and air\nRefuge nowhere can I find\nSave Him only, if my mind\nWill cast off before it die\nThe burden of this vanity.\nOne there was who reigned of old,\nBig with wrath to brave and blast,\nLo, his name is no more told!\nAnd who followed met at last\nHis Third-thrower, and is gone.\nOnly they whose hearts have known\nZeus, the Conqueror and the Friend,\nThey shall win their vision’s end;\nZeus the Guide, who made man turn\nThought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain\nMan by Suffering shall Learn.\nSo the heart of him, again\nAching with remembered pain,\nBleeds and sleepeth not, until\nWisdom comes against his will.\n’Tis the gift of One by strife\nLifted to the throne of life.\n(AGAMEMNON accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the fleet lay at Aulis.)\nSo that day the Elder Lord,\nMarshal of the Achaian ships,\nStrove not with the prophet’s word,\nBowed him to his fate’s eclipse,\nWhen with empty jars and lips\nParched and seas impassable\nFate on that Greek army fell,\nFronting Chalcis as it lay,\nBy Aulis in the swirling bay.\n(Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the death of AGAMEMNON’S daughter. The King’s doubt and grief.)\nAnd winds, winds blew from Strymon River,\nUnharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour,\nMan-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark,\nAnd the waste of days was made long, more long,\nTill the flower of Argos was aghast and withered;\nThen through the storm rose the War-seer’s song,\nAnd told of medicine that should tame the tempest,\nBut bow the Princes to a direr wrong.\nThen “Artemis” he whispered, he named the name;\nAnd the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them,\nAnd smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.\nBut the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:\n“A heavy doom, sure, if God’s will were broken;\nBut to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,\nIs that not heavy? That her blood should flow\nOn her father’s hand, hard beside an altar?\nMy path is sorrow wheresoe’er I go.\nShall Agamemnon fail his ships and people,\nAnd the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow?\nThey cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,\nFor a Virgin’s blood: ’tis a rite of old, men tell.\nAnd they burn with longing.—O God may the end be well!”\n(But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice.)\nTo the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly,\nAnd a strange wind within his bosom tossed,\nA wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;\nAnd he rose up, daring to the uttermost.\nFor men are boldened by a Blindness, straying\nToward base desire, which brings grief hereafter,\nYea, and itself is grief;\nSo this man hardened to his own child’s slaying,\nAs help to avenge him for a woman’s laughter\nAnd bring his ships relief!\nHer “Father, Father,” her sad cry that lingered,\nHer virgin heart’s breath they held all as naught,\nThose bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered;\nAnd there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought\nHe charged the young men to uplift and bind her,\nAs ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar,\nFierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore\nTo the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder\nThe sweet mouth’s utterance, the cries that falter,\n—His curse for evermore!—\nWith violence and a curb’s voiceless wrath.\nHer stole of saffron then to the ground she threw,\nAnd her eye with an arrow of pity found its path\nTo each man’s heart that slew:\nA face in a picture, striving amazedly;\nThe little maid who danced at her father’s board,\nThe innocent voice man’s love came never nigh,\nWho joined to his her little paean-cry\nWhen the third cup was poured….\nWhat came thereafter I saw not neither tell.\nBut the craft of Calchas failed not.—’Tis written, He\nWho Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well.\nAnd that which is to be,\nYe will know at last; why weep before the hour?\nFor come it shall, as out of darkness dawn.\nOnly may good from all this evil flower;\nSo prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower\nGuarding the land alone.\n[As they cease, CLYTEMNESTRA comes from the Palace with Attendants. She has finished her prayer and sacrifice, and is now wrought up to face the meeting with her husband. The Leader approaches her.]\nLEADER.\nBefore thy state, O Queen, I bow mine eyes.\n’Tis written, when the man’s throne empty lies,\nThe woman shall be honoured.—Hast thou heard\nSome tiding sure? Or is it Hope, hath stirred\nTo fire these altars? Dearly though we seek\nTo learn, ’tis thine to speak or not to speak.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nGlad-voiced, the old saw telleth, comes this morn,\nThe Star-child of a dancing midnight born,\nAnd beareth to thine ear a word of joy\nBeyond all hope: the Greek hath taken Troy.\nLEADER.\nHow?\nThy word flies past me, being incredible.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nIlion is ours. No riddling tale I tell.\nLEADER.\nSuch joy comes knocking at the gate of tears.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, ’tis a faithful heart that eye declares.\nLEADER.\nWhat warrant hast thou? Is there proof of this?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThere is; unless a God hath lied there is.\nLEADER.\nSome dream-shape came to thee in speaking guise?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWho deemeth me a dupe of drowsing eyes?\nLEADER.\nSome word within that hovereth without wings?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAm I a child to hearken to such things?\nLEADER.\nTroy fallen?—But how long? When fell she, say?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThe very night that mothered this new day.\nLEADER.\nAnd who of heralds with such fury came?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nA Fire-god, from Mount Ida scattering flame.\nWhence starting, beacon after beacon burst\nIn flaming message hitherward. Ida first\nTold Hermes’ Lemnian Rock, whose answering sign\nWas caught by towering Athos, the divine,\nWith pines immense—yea, fishes of the night\nSwam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,\nWhich swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far\nMakistos’ watchmen marked a glimmering star;\nThey, nowise loath nor idly slumber-won,\nSpring up to hurl the fiery message on,\nAnd a far light beyond the Eurîpus tells\nThat word hath reached Messapion’s sentinels.\nThey beaconed back, then onward with a high\nHeap of dead heather flaming to the sky.\nAnd onward still, not failing nor aswoon,\nAcross the Asôpus like a beaming moon\nThe great word leapt, and on Kithairon’s height\nUproused a new relay of racing light.\nHis watchers knew the wandering flame, nor hid\nTheir welcome, burning higher than was bid.\nOut over Lake Gorgôpis then it floats,\nTo Aigiplanctos, waking the wild goats,\nCrying for “Fire, more Fire!” And fire was reared,\nStintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,\nThat waved in flame beyond the promontory\nRock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,\nKindling the night: then one short swoop to catch\nThe Spider’s Crag, our city’s tower of watch;\nWhence hither to the Atreidae’s roof it came,\nA light true-fathered of Idaean flame.\nTorch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold\nThe tale thereof in stations manifold,\nEach one by each made perfect ere it passed,\nAnd Victory in the first as in the last.\nThese be my proofs and tokens that my lord\nFrom Troy hath spoke to me a burning word.\nLEADER.\nWoman, speak on. Hereafter shall my prayer\nBe raised to God; now let me only hear,\nAgain and full, the marvel and the joy.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNow, even now, the Achaian holdeth Troy!\nMethinks there is a crying in her streets\nThat makes no concord. When sweet unguent meets\nWith vinegar in one phial, I warrant none\nShall lay those wranglers lovingly at one.\nSo conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,\nTwo sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear.\nHere women in the dust about their slain,\nHusbands or brethren, and by dead old men\nPale children who shall never more be free,\nFor all they loved on earth cry desolately.\nAnd hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark\nBattle and then long searching through the dark\nHath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast\nAt last on all the plenty Troy possessed,\nNo portion in that feast nor ordinance,\nBut each man clutching at the prize of chance.\nAye, there at last under good roofs they lie\nOf men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,\nNo watches more, no bitter moony dew….\nHow blessèd they will sleep the whole night through!\nOh, if these days they keep them free from sin\nToward Ilion’s conquered shrines and Them within\nWho watch unconquered, maybe not again\nThe smiter shall be smit, the taker ta’en.\nMay God but grant there fall not on that host\nThe greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust\nTo spoil inviolate things! But half the race\nIs run which windeth back to home and peace.\nYea, though of God they pass unchallengèd,\nMethinks the wound of all those desolate dead\nMight waken, groping for its will….\nYe hear\nA woman’s word, belike a woman’s fear.\nMay good but conquer in the last incline\nOf the balance! Of all prayers that prayer is mine.\nLEADER.\nO Woman, like a man faithful and wise\nThou speakest. I accept thy testimonies\nAnd turn to God with praising, for a gain\nIs won this day that pays for all our pain.\n[CLYTEMNESTRA returns to the Palace. The CHORUS take up their position for the Second Stasimon.]\nAN ELDER.\nO Zeus, All-ruler, and Night the Aid,\nGainer of glories, and hast thou thrown\nOver the towers of Ilion\nThy net close-laid,\nThat none so nimble and none so tall\nShall escape withal\nThe snare of the slaver that claspeth all?\nANOTHER.\nAnd Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend\nI also praise, who hath wrought this end.\nLong since on Paris his shaft he drew,\nAnd hath aimèd true,\nNot too soon falling nor yet too far,\nThe fire of the avenging star.\nCHORUS.\n(This is God’s judgement upon Troy. May it not be too fierce! Gold cannot save one who spurneth Justice.)\nThe stroke of Zeus hath found them! Clear this day\nThe tale, and plain to trace.\nHe judged, and Troy hath fallen.—And have men said\nThat God not deigns to mark man’s hardihead,\nTrampling to earth the grace\nOf holy and delicate things?—Sin lies that way.\nFor visibly Pride doth breed its own return\nOn prideful men, who, when their houses swell\nWith happy wealth, breathe ever wrath and blood.\nYet not too fierce let the due vengeance burn;\nOnly as deemeth well\nOne wise of mood.\nNever shall state nor gold\nShelter his heart from aching\nWhoso the Altar of Justice old\nSpurneth to Night unwaking.\n(The Sinner suffers in his longing till at last Temptation overcomes him; as longing for Helen overcame Paris.)\nThe tempting of misery forceth him, the dread\nChild of fore-scheming Woe!\nAnd help is vain; the fell desire within\nIs veilèd not, but shineth bright like Sin:\nAnd as false gold will show\nBlack where the touchstone trieth, so doth fade\nHis honour in God’s ordeal. Like a child,\nForgetting all, he hath chased his wingèd bird,\nAnd planted amid his people a sharp thorn.\nAnd no God hears his prayer, or, have they heard,\nThe man so base-beguiled\nThey cast to scorn.\nParis to Argos came;\nLove of a woman led him;\nSo God’s altar he brought to shame,\nRobbing the hand that fed him.\n(Helen’s flight; the visions seen by the King’s seers; the phantom of Helen and the King’s grief.)\nShe hath left among her people a noise of shield and sword,\nA tramp of men armed where the long ships are moored;\nShe hath ta’en in her goings Desolation as a dower;\nShe hath stept, stept quickly, through the great gated Tower,\nAnd the thing that could not be, it hath been!\nAnd the Seers they saw visions, and they spoke of strange ill:\n“A Palace, a Palace; and a great King thereof:\nA bed, a bed empty, that was once pressed in love:\nAnd thou, thou, what art thou? Let us be, thou so still,\nBeyond wrath, beyond beseeching, to the lips reft of thee!”\nFor she whom he desireth is beyond the deep sea,\nAnd a ghost in his castle shall be queen.\nImages in sweet guise\nCarven shall move him never,\nWhere is Love amid empty eyes?\nGone, gone for ever!\n(His dreams and his suffering; but the War that he made caused greater and wider suffering.)\nBut a shape that is a dream, ’mid the phantoms of the night,\nCometh near, full of tears, bringing vain vain delight:\nFor in vain when, desiring, he can feel the joy’s breath\n—Nevermore! Nevermore!—from his arms it vanisheth,\nOn wings down the pathways of sleep.\nIn the mid castle hall, on the hearthstone of the Kings,\nThese griefs there be, and griefs passing these,\nBut in each man’s dwelling of the host that sailed the seas,\nA sad woman waits; she has thoughts of many things,\nAnd patience in her heart lieth deep.\nKnoweth she them she sent,\nKnoweth she? Lo, returning,\nComes in stead of the man that went\nArmour and dust of burning.\n(The return of the funeral urns; the murmurs of the People.)\nAnd the gold-changer, Ares, who changeth quick for dead,\nWho poiseth his scale in the striving of the spears,\nBack from Troy sendeth dust, heavy dust, wet with tears,\nSendeth ashes with men’s names in his urns neatly spread.\nAnd they weep over the men, and they praise them one by one,\nHow this was a wise fighter, and this nobly-slain—\n“Fighting to win back another’s wife!”\nTill a murmur is begun,\nAnd there steals an angry pain\nAgainst Kings too forward in the strife.\nThere by Ilion’s gate\nMany a soldier sleepeth,\nYoung men beautiful; fast in hate\nTroy her conqueror keepeth.\n(For the Shedder of Blood is in great peril, and not unmarked by God. May I never be a Sacker of Cities!)\nBut the rumour of the People, it is heavy, it is chill;\nAnd tho’ no curse be spoken, like a curse doth it brood;\nAnd my heart waits some tiding which the dark holdeth still,\nFor of God not unmarked is the shedder of much blood.\nAnd who conquers beyond right … Lo, the life of man decays;\nThere be Watchers dim his light in the wasting of the years;\nHe falls, he is forgotten, and hope dies.\nThere is peril in the praise\nOver-praised that he hears;\nFor the thunder it is hurled from God’s eyes.\nGlory that breedeth strife,\nPride of the Sacker of Cities;\nYea, and the conquered captive’s life,\nSpare me, O God of Pities!\nDIVERS ELDERS.\n—The fire of good tidings it hath sped the city through,\nBut who knows if a god mocketh? Or who knows if all be true?\n’Twere the fashion of a child,\nOr a brain dream-beguiled,\nTo be kindled by the first\nTorch’s message as it burst,\nAnd thereafter, as it dies, to die too.\n—’Tis like a woman’s sceptre, to ordain\nWelcome to joy before the end is plain!\n—Too lightly opened are a woman’s ears;\nHer fence downtrod by many trespassers,\nAnd quickly crossed; but quickly lost\nThe burden of a woman’s hopes or fears.\n[Here a break occurs in the action, like the descent of the curtain in a modern theatre. A space of some days is assumed to have passed and we find the Elders again assembled.]\nLEADER.\nSoon surely shall we read the message right;\nWere fire and beacon-call and lamps of light\nTrue speakers, or but happy lights, that seem\nAnd are not, like sweet voices in a dream.\nI see a Herald yonder by the shore,\nShadowed with olive sprays. And from his sore\nRent raiment cries a witness from afar,\nDry Dust, born brother to the Mire of war,\nThat mute he comes not, neither through the smoke\nOf mountain forests shall his tale be spoke;\nBut either shouting for a joyful day,\nOr else…. But other thoughts I cast away.\nAs good hath dawned, may good shine on, we pray!\n—And whoso for this City prayeth aught\nElse, let him reap the harvest of his thought!\n[Enter the HERALD, running. His garments are torn and war-stained. He falls upon his knees and kisses the Earth, and salutes each Altar in turn.]\nHERALD.\nLand of my fathers! Argos! Am I here …\nHome, home at this tenth shining of the year,\nAnd all Hope’s anchors broken save this one!\nFor scarcely dared I dream, here in mine own\nArgos at last to fold me to my rest….\nBut now—All Hail, O Earth! O Sunlight blest!\nAnd Zeus Most High!\n[Checking himself as he sees the altar of Apollo.]\nAnd thou, O Pythian Lord;\nNo more on us be thy swift arrows poured!\nBeside Scamander well we learned how true\nThy hate is. Oh, as thou art Healer too,\nHeal us! As thou art Saviour of the Lost,\nSave also us, Apollo, being so tossed\nWith tempest! … All ye Daemons of the Pale!\nAnd Hermes! Hermes, mine own guardian, hail!\nHerald beloved, to whom all heralds bow….\nYe Blessèd Dead that sent us, receive now\nIn love your children whom the spear hath spared.\nO House of Kings, O roof-tree thrice-endeared,\nO solemn thrones! O gods that face the sun!\nNow, now, if ever in the days foregone,\nAfter these many years, with eyes that burn,\nGive hail and glory to your King’s return!\nFor Agamemnon cometh! A great light\nCometh to men and gods out of the night.\nGrand greeting give him—aye, it need be grand—\nWho, God’s avenging mattock in his hand,\nHath wrecked Troy’s towers and digged her soil beneath,\nTill her gods’ houses, they are things of death;\nHer altars waste, and blasted every seed\nWhence life might rise! So perfect is his deed,\nSo dire the yoke on Ilion he hath cast,\nThe first Atreides, King of Kings at last,\nAnd happy among men! To whom we give\nHonour most high above all things that live.\nFor Paris nor his guilty land can score\nThe deed they wrought above the pain they bore.\n“Spoiler and thief,” he heard God’s judgement pass;\nWhereby he lost his plunder, and like grass\nMowed down his father’s house and all his land;\nAnd Troy pays twofold for the sin she planned.\nLEADER.\nBe glad, thou Herald of the Greek from Troy!\nHERALD.\nSo glad, I am ready, if God will, to die!\nLEADER.\nDid love of this land work thee such distress?\nHERALD.\nThe tears stand in mine eyes for happiness.\nLEADER.\nSweet sorrow was it, then, that on you fell.\nHERALD.\nHow sweet? I cannot read thy parable.\nLEADER.\nTo pine again for them that loved you true.\nHERALD.\nDid ye then pine for us, as we for you?\nLEADER.\nThe whole land’s heart was dark, and groaned for thee.\nHERALD.\nDark? For what cause? Why should such darkness be?\nLEADER.\nSilence in wrong is our best medicine here.\nHERALD.\nYour kings were gone. What others need you fear?\nLEADER.\n’Tis past! Like thee now, I could gladly die.\nHERALD.\nEven so! ’Tis past, and all is victory.\nAnd, for our life in those long years, there were\nDoubtless some grievous days, and some were fair.\nWho but a god goes woundless all his way?….\nOh, could I tell the sick toil of the day,\nThe evil nights, scant decks ill-blanketed;\nThe rage and cursing when our daily bread\nCame not! And then on land ’twas worse than all.\nOur quarters close beneath the enemy’s wall;\nAnd rain—and from the ground the river dew—\nWet, always wet! Into our clothes it grew,\nPlague-like, and bred foul beasts in every hair.\nWould I could tell how ghastly midwinter\nStole down from Ida till the birds dropped dead!\nOr the still heat, when on his noonday bed\nThe breathless blue sea sank without a wave!….\nWhy think of it? They are past and in the grave,\nAll those long troubles. For I think the slain\nCare little if they sleep or rise again;\nAnd we, the living, wherefore should we ache\nWith counting all our lost ones, till we wake\nThe old malignant fortunes? If Good-bye\nComes from their side, Why, let them go, say I.\nSurely for us, who live, good doth prevail\nUnchallenged, with no wavering of the scale;\nWherefore we vaunt unto these shining skies,\nAs wide o’er sea and land our glory flies:\n“By men of Argolis who conquered Troy,\nThese spoils, a memory and an ancient joy,\nAre nailed in the gods’ houses throughout Greece.”\nWhich whoso readeth shall with praise increase\nOur land, our kings, and God’s grace manifold\nWhich made these marvels be.—My tale is told.\nLEADER.\nIndeed thou conquerest me. Men say, the light\nIn old men’s eyes yet serves to learn aright.\nBut Clytemnestra and the House should hear\nThese tidings first, though I their health may share.\n[During the last words CLYTEMNESTRA has entered from the Palace.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nLong since I lifted up my voice in joy,\nWhen the first messenger from flaming Troy\nSpake through the dark of sack and overthrow.\nAnd mockers chid me: “Because beacons show\nOn the hills, must Troy be fallen? Quickly born\nAre women’s hopes!” Aye, many did me scorn;\nYet gave I sacrifice; and by my word\nThrough all the city our woman’s cry was heard,\nLifted in blessing round the seats of God,\nAnd slumbrous incense o’er the altars glowed\nIn fragrance.\nAnd for thee, what need to tell\nThy further tale? My lord himself shall well\nInstruct me. Yet, to give my lord and king\nAll reverent greeting at his homecoming—\nWhat dearer dawn on woman’s eyes can flame\nThan this, which casteth wide her gate to acclaim\nThe husband whom God leadeth safe from war?—\nGo, bear my lord this prayer: That fast and far\nHe haste him to this town which loves his name;\nAnd in his castle may he find the same\nWife that he left, a watchdog of the hall,\nTrue to one voice and fierce to others all;\nA body and soul unchanged, no seal of his\nBroke in the waiting years.—No thought of ease\nNor joy from other men hath touched my soul,\nNor shall touch, until bronze be dyed like wool.\nA boast so faithful and so plain, I wot,\nSpoke by a royal Queen doth shame her not.\n[Exit CLYTEMNESTRA.]\nLEADER.\nLet thine ear mark her message. ’Tis of fair\nSeeming, and craves a clear interpreter….\nBut, Herald, I would ask thee; tell me true\nOf Menelaüs. Shall he come with you,\nOur land’s belovèd crown, untouched of ill?\nHERALD.\nI know not how to speak false words of weal\nFor friends to reap thereof a harvest true.\nLEADER.\nCanst speak of truth with comfort joined? Those two\nOnce parted, ’tis a gulf not lightly crossed.\nHERALD.\nYour king is vanished from the Achaian host,\nHe and his ship! Such comfort have I brought.\nLEADER.\nSailed he alone from Troy? Or was he caught\nBy storms in the midst of you, and swept away?\nHERALD.\nThou hast hit the truth; good marksman, as men say!\nAnd long to suffer is but brief to tell.\nLEADER.\nHow ran the sailors’ talk? Did there prevail\nOne rumour, showing him alive or dead?\nHERALD.\nNone knoweth, none hath tiding, save the head\nOf Helios, ward and watcher of the world.\nLEADER.\nThen tell us of the storm. How, when God hurled\nHis anger, did it rise? How did it die?\nHERALD.\nIt likes me not, a day of presage high\nWith dolorous tongue to stain. Those twain, I vow,\nStand best apart. When one with shuddering brow,\nFrom armies lost, back beareth to his home\nWord that the terror of her prayers is come;\nOne wound in her great heart, and many a fate\nFor many a home of men cast out to sate\nThe two-fold scourge that worketh Ares’ lust,\nSpear crossed with spear, dust wed with bloody dust;\nWho walketh laden with such weight of wrong,\nWhy, let him, if he will, uplift the song\nThat is Hell’s triumph. But to come as I\nAm now come, laden with deliverance high,\nHome to a land of peace and laughing eyes,\nAnd mar all with that fury of the skies\nWhich made our Greeks curse God—how should this be?\nTwo enemies most ancient, Fire and Sea,\nA sudden friendship swore, and proved their plight\nBy war on us poor sailors through that night\nOf misery, when the horror of the wave\nTowered over us, and winds from Strymon drave\nHull against hull, till good ships, by the horn\nOf the mad whirlwind gored and overborne,\nOne here, one there, ’mid rain and blinding spray,\nLike sheep by a devil herded, passed away.\nAnd when the blessèd Sun upraised his head,\nWe saw the Aegean waste a-foam with dead,\nDead men, dead ships, and spars disasterful.\nHowbeit for us, our one unwounded hull\nOut of that wrath was stolen or begged free\nBy some good spirit—sure no man was he!—\nWho guided clear our helm; and on till now\nHath Saviour Fortune throned her on the prow.\nNo surge to mar our mooring, and no floor\nOf rock to tear us when we made for shore.\nTill, fled from that sea-hell, with the clear sun\nAbove us and all trust in fortune gone,\nWe drove like sheep about our brain the thoughts\nOf that lost army, broken and scourged with knouts\nOf evil. And, methinks, if there is breath\nIn them, they talk of us as gone to death—\nHow else?—and so say we of them! For thee,\nSince Menelaüs thy first care must be,\nIf by some word of Zeus, who wills not yet\nTo leave the old house for ever desolate,\nSome ray of sunlight on a far-off sea\nLights him, yet green and living … we may see\nHis ship some day in the harbour!—’Twas the word\nOf truth ye asked me for, and truth ye have heard!\n[Exit HERALD. The CHORUS take position for the Third Stasimon.]\nCHORUS.\n(Surely there was mystic meaning in the name HELENA, meaning which was fulfilled when she fled to Troy.)\nWho was He who found for thee\nThat name, truthful utterly—\nWas it One beyond our vision\nMoving sure in pre-decision\nOf man’s doom his mystic lips?—\nCalling thee, the Battle-wed,\nThee, the Strife-encompassèd,\nHELEN? Yea, in fate’s derision,\nHell in cities, Hell in ships,\nHell in hearts of men they knew her,\nWhen the dim and delicate fold\nOf her curtains backward rolled,\nAnd to sea, to sea, she threw her\nIn the West Wind’s giant hold;\nAnd with spear and sword behind her\nCame the hunters in a flood,\nDown the oarblade’s viewless trail\nTracking, till in Simoïs’ vale\nThrough the leaves they crept to find her,\nA Wrath, a seed of blood.\n(The Trojans welcomed her with triumph and praised Alexander till at last their song changed and they saw another meaning in Alexander’s name also.)\nSo the Name to Ilion came\nOn God’s thought-fulfilling flame,\nShe a vengeance and a token\nOf the unfaith to bread broken,\nOf the hearth of God betrayed,\nAgainst them whose voices swelled\nGlorying in the prize they held\nAnd the Spoiler’s vaunt outspoken\nAnd the song his brethren made\n’Mid the bridal torches burning;\nTill, behold, the ancient City\nOf King Priam turned, and turning\nTook a new song for her learning,\nA song changed and full of pity,\nWith the cry of a lost nation;\nAnd she changed the bridegroom’s name:\nCalled him Paris Ghastly-wed;\nFor her sons were with the dead,\nAnd her life one lamentation,\n’Mid blood and burning flame.\n(Like a lion’s whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great beast of prey,)\nLo, once there was a herdsman reared\nIn his own house, so stories tell,\nA lion’s whelp, a milk-fed thing\nAnd soft in life’s first opening\nAmong the sucklings of the herd;\nThe happy children loved him well,\nAnd old men smiled, and oft, they say,\nIn men’s arms, like a babe, he lay,\nBright-eyed, and toward the hand that teased him\nEagerly fawning for food or play.\nThen on a day outflashed the sudden\nRage of the lion brood of yore;\nHe paid his debt to them that fed\nWith wrack of herds and carnage red,\nYea, wrought him a great feast unbidden,\nTill all the house-ways ran with gore;\nA sight the thralls fled weeping from,\nA great red slayer, beard a-foam,\nHigh-priest of some blood-cursèd altar\nGod had uplifted against that home.\n(So was it with Helen in Troy.)\nAnd how shall I call the thing that came\nAt the first hour to Ilion city?\nCall it a dream of peace untold,\nA secret joy in a mist of gold,\nA woman’s eye that was soft, like flame,\nA flower which ate a man’s heart with pity.\nBut she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending,\nAnd a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending,\nWhen to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o’er the deep,\nWith the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind,\nA death-bride, whom brides long shall weep.\n(Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God; not so; Good Fortune may be innocent, and then there is no vengeance.)\nA grey word liveth, from the morn\nOf old time among mortals spoken,\nThat man’s Wealth waxen full shall fall\nNot childless, but get sons withal;\nAnd ever of great bliss is born\nA tear unstanched and a heart broken.\nBut I hold my thought alone and by others unbeguiled;\n’Tis the deed that is unholy shall have issue, child on child,\nSin on sin, like his begetters; and they shall be as they were.\nBut the man who walketh straight, and the house thereof, tho’ Fate\nExalt him, the children shall be fair.\n(It is Sin, it is Pride and Ruthlessness, that beget children like themselves till Justice is fulfilled upon them.)\nBut Old Sin loves, when comes the hour again,\nTo bring forth New,\nWhich laugheth lusty amid the tears of men;\nYea, and Unruth, his comrade, wherewith none\nMay plead nor strive, which dareth on and on,\nKnowing not fear nor any holy thing;\nTwo fires of darkness in a house, born true,\nLike to their ancient spring.\nBut Justice shineth in a house low-wrought\nWith smoke-stained wall,\nAnd honoureth him who filleth his own lot;\nBut the unclean hand upon the golden stair\nWith eyes averse she flieth, seeking where\nThings innocent are; and, recking not the power\nOf wealth by man misgloried, guideth all\nTo her own destined hour.\n[Here amid a great procession enter AGAMEMNON on a Chariot. Behind him on another Chariot is CASSANDRA. The CHORUS approach and make obeisance. Some of AGAMEMNON’S men have on their shields a White Horse, some a Lion. Their arms are rich and partly barbaric.]\nLEADER.\nAll hail, O King! Hail, Atreus’ Son!\nSacker of Cities! Ilion’s bane!\nWith what high word shall I greet thee again,\nHow give thee worship, and neither outrun\nThe point of pleasure, nor stint too soon?\nFor many will cling. To fair seeming\nThe faster because they have sinned erewhile;\nAnd a man may sigh with never a sting\nOf grief in his heart, and a man may smile\nWith eyes unlit and a lip that strains.\nBut the wise Shepherd knoweth his sheep,\nAnd his eyes pierce deep\nThe faith like water that fawns and feigns.\nBut I hide nothing, O King. That day\nWhen in quest of Helen our battle array\nHurled forth, thy name upon my heart’s scroll\nWas deep in letters of discord writ;\nAnd the ship of thy soul,\nIll-helmed and blindly steered was it,\nPursuing ever, through men that die,\nOne wild heart that was fain to fly.\nBut on this new day,\nFrom the deep of my thought and in love, I say\n“Sweet is a grief well ended;”\nAnd in time’s flow Thou wilt learn and know\nThe true from the false,\nOf them that were left to guard the walls\nOf thine empty Hall unfriended.\n[During the above CLYTEMNESTRA has appeared on the Palace steps, with a train of Attendants, to receive her Husband.]\nAGAMEMNON.\nTo Argos and the gods of Argolis\nAll hail, who share with me the glory of this\nHome-coming and the vengeance I did wreak\nOn Priam’s City! Yea, though none should speak,\nThe great gods heard our cause, and in one mood\nUprising, in the urn of bitter blood,\nThat men should shriek and die and towers should burn,\nCast their great vote; while over Mercy’s urn\nHope waved her empty hands and nothing fell.\nEven now in smoke that City tells her tale;\nThe wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died\nThe reek of the old fatness of her pride\nFrom hot and writhing ashes rolls afar.\nFor which let thanks, wide as our glories are,\nBe uplifted; seeing the Beast of Argos hath\nRound Ilion’s towers piled high his fence of wrath\nAnd, for one woman ravished, wrecked by force\nA City. Lo, the leap of the wild Horse\nin darkness when the Pleiades were dead;\nA mailed multitude, a Lion unfed,\nWhich leapt the tower and lapt the blood of Kings!\nLo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings.\nBut for thy words: I marked them, and I mind\nTheir meaning, and my voice shall be behind\nThine. For not many men, the proverb saith,\nCan love a friend whom fortune prospereth\nUnenvying; and about the envious brain\nCold poison clings, and doubles all the pain\nLife brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,\nAnd feels another’s gladness like a curse.\nWell can I speak. I know the mirrored glass\nCalled friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass\nAnd feign them a King’s friends. I have known but one—\nOdysseus, him we trapped against his own\nWill!—who once harnessed bore his yoke right well …\nBe he alive or dead of whom I tell\nThe tale. And for the rest, touching our state\nAnd gods, we will assemble in debate\nA concourse of all Argos, taking sure\nCounsel, that what is well now may endure\nWell, and if aught needs healing medicine, still\nBy cutting and by fire, with all good will,\nI will essay to avert the after-wrack\nSuch sickness breeds.\nAye, Heaven hath led me back;\nAnd on this hearth where still my fire doth burn\nI will go pay to heaven my due return,\nWhich guides me here, which saved me far away.\nO Victory, now mine own, be mine alway!\n[CLYTEMNESTRA, at the head of her retinue, steps forward. She controls her suspense with difficulty but gradually gains courage as she proceeds.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nYe Elders, Council of the Argive name\nHere present, I will no more hold it shame\nTo lay my passion bare before men’s eyes.\nThere comes a time to a woman when fear dies\nFor ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,\nSave me, the weight of years intolerable\nI lived while this man lay at Ilion.\nThat any woman thus should sit alone\nIn a half-empty house, with no man near,\nMakes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear\nAlway some voice of wrath; now messengers\nOf evil; now not so; then others worse,\nCrying calamity against mine and me.\nOh, had he half the wounds that variously\nCame rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,\nAll holes from heel to crown! And if he met\nAs many deaths as I met tales thereon,\nIs he some monstrous thing, some Gêryon\nThree-souled, that will not die, till o’er his head,\nThree robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?\nAye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose\nOf death had got me; but they cut me loose.\nIt was those voices alway in mine ear.\nFor that, too, young Orestes is not here\nBeside me, as were meet, seeing he above\nAll else doth hold the surety of our love;\nLet not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:\nOur loving spear-friend took him, Strophius\nThe Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy\nTwo-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,\nAnd ours here, if the rebel multitude\nShould cast the Council down. It is men’s mood\nAlway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,\nAnd sure no guile was in him.\nBut for me,\nThe old stormy rivers of my grief are dead\nNow at the spring; not one tear left unshed.\nMine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly\nWeeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee\nFor ever answerless. And did I dream,\nA gnat’s thin whirr would start me, like a scream\nOf battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,\nCrowding, too many for the time I slept.\nFrom all which stress delivered and free-souled,\nI greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,\nO forestay sure that fails not in the squall,\nO strong-based pillar of a towering hall;\nO single son to a father age-ridden;\nO land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;\nSunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;\nSpring of quick water in a desert dead ….\nHow sweet to be set free from any chain!\nThese be my words to greet him home again.\nNo god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou\nHave suffered in time past enough! And now\nDismount, O head with love and glory crowned,\nFrom this high car; yet plant not on bare ground\nThy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy.\nHo, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,\nA floor of crimson broideries to spread\nFor the King’s path. Let all the ground be red\nWhere those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,\nHome light him to the hearth he looks not for!\nWhat followeth next, our sleepless care shall see\nOrdered as God’s good pleasure may decree.\n[The attendants spread tapestries of crimson and gold from the Chariot to the Door of the Palace. AGAMEMNON does not move.]\nAGAMEMNON.\nDaughter of Leda, watcher of my fold,\nIn sooth thy welcome, grave and amply told,\nFitteth mine absent years. Though it had been\nSeemlier, methinks, some other, not my Queen,\nHad spoke these honours. For the rest, I say,\nSeek not to make me soft in woman’s way;\nCry not thy praise to me wide-mouthed, nor fling\nThy body down, as to some barbarous king.\nNor yet with broidered hangings strew my path,\nTo awake the unseen ire. ’Tis God that hath\nSuch worship; and for mortal man to press\nRude feet upon this broidered loveliness …\nI vow there is danger in it. Let my road\nBe honoured, surely; but as man, not god.\nRugs for the feet and yonder broidered pall …\nThe names ring diverse!… Aye, and not to fall\nSuddenly blind is of all gifts the best\nGod giveth, for I reckon no man blest\nEre to the utmost goal his race be run.\nSo be it; and if, as this day I have done,\nI shall do always, then I fear no ill.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nTell me but this, nowise against thy will …\nAGAMEMNON.\nMy will, be sure, shall falter not nor fade.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWas this a vow in some great peril made?\nAGAMEMNON.\nEnough! I have spoke my purpose, fixed and plain.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWere Priam the conqueror … Think, would he refrain?\nAGAMEMNON.\nOh, stores of broideries would be trampled then!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nLord, care not for the cavillings of men!\nAGAMEMNON.\nThe murmur of a people hath strange weight.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWho feareth envy, feareth to be great.\nAGAMEMNON.\n’Tis graceless when a woman strives to lead.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWhen a great conqueror yields, ’tis grace indeed,\nAGAMEMNON.\nSo in this war thou must my conqueror be?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nYield! With good will to yield is victory!\nAGAMEMNON.\nWell, if I needs must … Be it as thou hast said!\nQuick! Loose me these bound slaves on which I tread,\nAnd while I walk yon wonders of the sea\nGod grant no eye of wrath be cast on me\nFrom far!\n[The Attendants untie his shoes.]\nFor even now it likes me not\nTo waste mine house, thus marring underfoot\nThe pride thereof, and wondrous broideries\nBought in far seas with silver. But of these\nEnough.—And mark, I charge thee, this princess\nOf Ilion; tend her with all gentleness.\nGod’s eye doth see, and loveth from afar,\nThe merciful conqueror. For no slave of war\nIs slave by his own will. She is the prize\nAnd chosen flower of Ilion’s treasuries,\nSet by the soldiers’ gift to follow me.\nNow therefore, seeing I am constrained by thee\nAnd do thy will, I walk in conqueror’s guise\nBeneath my Gate, trampling sea-crimson dyes.\n[As he dismounts and sets foot on the Tapestries CLYTEMNESTRA’S women utter again their Cry of Triumph. The people bow or kneel as he passes.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nThere is the sea—its caverns who shall drain?—\nBreeding of many a purple-fish the stain\nSurpassing silver, ever fresh renewed,\nFor robes of kings. And we, by right indued,\nPossess our fill thereof. Thy house, O King,\nKnoweth no stint, nor lack of anything.\nWhat trampling of rich raiment, had the cry\nSo sounded in the domes of prophesy,\nWould I have vowed these years, as price to pay\nFor this dear life in peril far away!\nWhere the root is, the leafage cometh soon\nTo clothe an house, and spread its leafy boon\nAgainst the burning star; and, thou being come,\nThou, on the midmost hearthstone of thy home,\nOh, warmth in winter leapeth to thy sign.\nAnd when God’s summer melteth into wine\nThe green grape, on that house shall coolness fall\nWhere the true man, the master, walks his hall.\nZeus, Zeus! True Master, let my prayers be true!\nAnd, oh, forget not that thou art willed to do!\n[She follows AGAMEMNON into the Palace. The retinues of both King and Queen go in after them. CASSANDRA remains.]\nCHORUS.\nWhat is this that evermore, [Strophe 1.\nA cold terror at the door\nOf this bosom presage-haunted,\nPale as death hovereth?\nWhile a song unhired, unwanted,\nBy some inward prophet chanted,\nSpeaks the secret at its core;\nAnd to cast it from my blood\nLike a dream not understood\nNo sweet-spoken Courage now\nSitteth at my heart’s dear prow.\nYet I know that manifold\nDays, like sand, have waxen old\nSince the day those shoreward-thrown\nCables flapped and line on line\nStanding forth for Ilion\nThe long galleys took the brine\n[Antistrophe 1.\nAnd in harbour—mine own eye\nHath beheld—again they lie;\nYet that lyreless music hidden\nWhispers still words of ill,\n’Tis the Soul of me unbidden,\nLike some Fury sorrow-ridden,\nWeeping over things that die.\nNeither waketh in my sense\nEver Hope’s dear confidence;\nFor this flesh that groans within,\nAnd these bones that know of Sin,\nThis tossed heart upon the spate\nOf a whirpool that is Fate,\nSurely these lie not.

Why must I come with thee….\nTo die, only to die?\nLEADER.\nThou art borne on the breath of God, thou spirit wild,\nFor thine own weird to wail,\nLike to that wingèd voice, that heart so sore\nWhich, crying alway, hungereth to cry more,\n“Itylus, Itylus,” till it sing her child\nBack to the nightingale.\nCASSANDRA.\nOh, happy Singing Bird, so sweet, so clear!\nSoft wings for her God made,\nAnd an easy passing, without pain or tear …\nFor me ’twill be torn flesh and rending blade.\nSECOND ELDER.\nWhence is it sprung, whence wafted on God’s breath,\nThis anguish reasonless?\nThis throbbing of terror shaped to melody,\nMoaning of evil blent with music high?\nWho hath marked out for thee that mystic path\nThrough thy woe’s wilderness?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas for the kiss, the kiss of Paris, his people’s bane!\nAlas for Scamander Water, the water my fathers drank!\nLong, long ago, I played about thy bank,\nAnd was cherished and grew strong;\nNow by a River of Wailing, by shores of Pain,\nSoon shall I make my song.\nLEADER.\nHow sayst thou? All too clear,\nThis ill word thou hast laid upon thy mouth!\nA babe could read thee plain.\nIt stabs within me like a serpent’s tooth,\nThe bitter thrilling music of her pain:\nI marvel as I hear.\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas for the toil, the toil of a City, worn unto death!\nAlas for my father’s worship before the citadel,\nThe flocks that bled and the tumult of their breath!\nBut no help from them came\nTo save Troy Towers from falling as they fell!…\nAnd I on the earth shall writhe, my heart aflame.\nSECOND ELDER.\nDark upon dark, new ominous words of ill!\nSure there hath swept on thee some Evil Thing,\nCrushing, which makes thee bleed\nAnd in the torment of thy vision sing\nThese plaining death-fraught oracles … Yet still, still,\nTheir end I cannot read!\nCASSANDRA. [By an effort she regains mastery of herself, and speaks directly to the Leader.]\n’Fore God, mine oracle shall no more hide\nWith veils his visage, like a new-wed bride!\nA shining wind out of this dark shall blow,\nPiercing the dawn, growing as great waves grow,\nTo burst in the heart of sunrise … stronger far\nThan this poor pain of mine. I will not mar\nWith mists my wisdom.\nBe near me as I go,\nTracking the evil things of long ago,\nAnd bear me witness. For this roof, there clings\nMusic about it, like a choir which sings\nOne-voiced, but not well-sounding, for not good\nThe words are. Drunken, drunken, and with blood,\nTo make them dare the more, a revelling rout\nIs in the rooms, which no man shall cast out,\nOf sister Furies. And they weave to song,\nHaunting the House, its first blind deed of wrong,\nSpurning in turn that King’s bed desecrate,\nDefiled, which paid a brother’s sin with hate….\nHath it missed or struck, mine arrow? Am I a poor\nDreamer, that begs and babbles at the door?\nGive first thine oath in witness, that I know\nOf this great dome the sins wrought long ago.\nELDER.\nAnd how should oath of mine, though bravely sworn,\nAppease thee? Yet I marvel that one born\nFar over seas, of alien speech, should fall\nSo apt, as though she had lived here and seen all.\nCASSANDRA.\nThe Seer Apollo made me too to see.\nELDER (in a low voice).\nWas the God’s heart pierced with desire for thee?\nCASSANDRA.\nTime was, I held it shame hereof to speak.\nELDER.\nAh, shame is for the mighty, not the weak.\nCASSANDRA.\nWe wrestled, and his breath to me was sweet.\nELDER.\nYe came to the getting of children, as is meet?\nCASSANDRA.\nI swore to Loxias, and I swore a lie.\nELDER.\nAlready thine the gift of prophecy?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlready I showed my people all their path.\nELDER.\nAnd Loxias did not smite thee in his wrath?\nCASSANDRA.\nAfter that sin … no man believed me more.\nELDER.\nNay, then, to us thy wisdom seemeth sure.\nCASSANDRA.\nOh, oh! Agony, agony!\nAgain the awful pains of prophecy\nAre on me, maddening as they fall….\nYe see them there … beating against the wall?\nSo young … like shapes that gather in a dream …\nSlain by a hand they loved. Children they seem,\nMurdered … and in their hands they bear baked meat:\nI think it is themselves. Yea, flesh; I see it;\nAnd inward parts…. Oh, what a horrible load\nTo carry! And their father drank their blood.\nFrom these, I warn ye, vengeance broodeth still,\nA lion’s rage, which goes not forth to kill\nBut lurketh in his lair, watching the high\nHall of my war-gone master … Master? Aye;\nMine, mine! The yoke is nailed about my neck….\nOh, lord of ships and trampler on the wreck\nOf Ilion, knows he not this she-wolf’s tongue,\nWhich licks and fawns, and laughs with ear up-sprung,\nTo bite in the end like secret death?—And can\nThe woman? Slay a strong and armèd man? …\nWhat fangèd reptile like to her doth creep?\nSome serpent amphisbene, some Skylla, deep\nHoused in the rock, where sailors shriek and die,\nMother of Hell blood-raging, which doth cry\nOn her own flesh war, war without alloy …\nGod! And she shouted in his face her joy,\nLike men in battle when the foe doth break.\nAnd feigns thanksgiving for his safety’s sake!\nWhat if no man believe me? ’Tis all one.\nThe thing which must be shall be; aye, and soon\nThou too shalt sorrow for these things, and here\nStanding confess me all too true a seer.\nLEADER.\nThe Thyestean feast of children slain\nI understood, and tremble. Aye, my brain\nReels at these visions, beyond guesswork true.\nBut after, though I heard, I had lost the clue.\nCASSANDRA.\nMan, thou shalt look on Agamemnon dead.\nLEADER.\nPeace, Mouth of Evil! Be those words unsaid!\nCASSANDRA.\nNo god of peace hath watch upon that hour.\nLEADER.\nIf it must come. Forefend it, Heavenly Power!\nCASSANDRA.\nThey do not think of prayer; they think of death.\nLEADER.\nThey? Say, what man this foul deed compasseth?\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas, thou art indeed fallen far astray!\nLEADER.\nHow could such deed be done? I see no way.\nCASSANDRA.\nYet know I not the Greek tongue all too well?\nLEADER.\nGreek are the Delphic dooms, but hard to spell.\nCASSANDRA.\nAh! Ah! There!\nWhat a strange fire! It moves … It comes at me.\nO Wolf Apollo, mercy! O agony! …\nWhy lies she with a wolf, this lioness lone,\nTwo-handed, when the royal lion is gone?\nGod, she will kill me! Like to them that brew\nPoison, I see her mingle for me too\nA separate vial in her wrath, and swear,\nWhetting her blade for him, that I must share\nHis death … because, because he hath dragged me here!\nOh, why these mockers at my throat? This gear\nOf wreathèd bands, this staff of prophecy?\nI mean to kill you first, before I die.\nBegone!\n[She tears off her prophetic habiliments; and presently throws them on the ground, and stamps on them.]\nDown to perdition! … Lie ye so?\nSo I requite you! Now make rich in woe\nSome other Bird of Evil, me no more!\n[Coming to herself.]\nAh, see! It is Apollo’s self, hath tore\nHis crown from me! Who watched me long ago\nIn this same prophet’s robe, by friend, by foe,\nAll with one voice, all blinded, mocked to scorn:\n“A thing of dreams,” “a beggar-maid outworn,”\nPoor, starving and reviled, I endured all;\nAnd now the Seer, who called me till my call\nWas perfect, leads me to this last dismay….\n’Tis not the altar-stone where men did slay\nMy father; ’tis a block, a block with gore\nYet hot, that waits me, of one slain before.\nYet not of God unheeded shall we lie.\nThere cometh after, one who lifteth high\nThe downfallen; a branch where blossometh\nA sire’s avenging and a mother’s death.\nExiled and wandering, from this land outcast,\nOne day He shall return, and set the last\nCrown on these sins that have his house downtrod.\nFor, lo, there is a great oath sworn of God,\nHis father’s upturned face shall guide him home.\nWhy should I grieve? Why pity these men’s doom?\nI who have seen the City of Ilion\nPass as she passed; and they who cast her down\nHave thus their end, as God gives judgement sure….\nI go to drink my cup. I will endure\nTo die. O Gates, Death-Gates, all hail to you!\nOnly, pray God the blow be stricken true!\nPray God, unagonized, with blood that flows\nQuick unto friendly death, these eyes may close!\nLEADER.\nO full of sorrows, full of wisdom great,\nWoman, thy speech is a long anguish; yet,\nKnowing thy doom, why walkst thou with clear eyes,\nLike some god-blinded beast, to sacrifice?\nCASSANDRA.\nThere is no escape, friends; only vain delay.\nLEADER.\nIs not the later still the sweeter day?\nCASSANDRA.\nThe day is come. Small profit now to fly.\nLEADER.\nThrough all thy griefs, Woman, thy heart is high.\nCASSANDRA.\nAlas! None that is happy hears that praise.\nLEADER.\nAre not the brave dead blest in after days?\nCASSANDRA.\nO Father! O my brethren brave, I come!\n[She moves towards the House, but recoils shuddering.]\nLEADER.\nWhat frights thee? What is that thou startest from?\nCASSANDRA.\nAh, faugh! Faugh!\nLEADER.\nWhat turns thee in that blind\nHorror? Unless some loathing of the mind …\nCASSANDRA.\nDeath drifting from the doors, and blood like rain!\nLEADER.\n’Tis but the dumb beasts at the altar slain.\nCASSANDRA.\nAnd vapours from a charnel-house … See there!\nLEADER.\n’Tis Tyrian incense clouding in the air.\nCASSANDRA (recovering herself again).\nSo be it!—I will go, in yonder room\nTo weep mine own and Agamemnon’s doom.\nMay death be all! Strangers, I am no bird\nThat pipeth trembling at a thicket stirred\nBy the empty wind. Bear witness on that day\nWhen woman for this woman’s life shall pay,\nAnd man for man ill-mated low shall lie:\nI ask this boon, as being about to die.\nLEADER.\nAlas, I pity thee thy mystic fate!\nCASSANDRA.\nOne word, one dirge-song would I utter yet\nO’er mine own corpse. To this last shining Sun\nI pray that, when the Avenger’s work is done,\nHis enemies may remember this thing too,\nThis little thing, the woman slave they slew!\nO world of men, farewell! A painted show\nIs all thy glory; and when life is low\nThe touch of a wet sponge out-blotteth all.\nOh, sadder this than any proud man’s fall!\n[She goes into the House.]\nCHORUS.\nGreat Fortune is an hungry thing,\nAnd filleth no heart anywhere,\nThough men with fingers menacing\nPoint at the great house, none will dare,\nWhen Fortune knocks, to bar the door\nProclaiming: “Come thou here no more!”\nLo, to this man the Gods have given\nGreat Ilion in the dust to tread\nAnd home return, emblazed of heaven;\nIf it is writ, he too shall go\nThrough blood for blood spilt long ago;\nIf he too, dying for the dead,\nShould crown the deaths of alien years,\nWhat mortal afar off, who hears,\nShall boast him Fortune’s Child, and led\nAbove the eternal tide of tears?\n[A sudden Cry from within.]\nVOICE.\nHo! Treason in the house! I am wounded: slain.\nLEADER.\nHush! In the castle! ’Twas a cry\nOf some man wounded mortally.\nVOICE.\nAh God, another! I am stricken again.\nLEADER.\nI think the deed is done. It was the King\nWho groaned…. Stand close, and think if anything….\n[The Old Men gather together under the shock, and debate confusedly.]\nELDER B.\nI give you straight my judgement. Summon all\nThe citizens to rescue. Sound a call!\nELDER C.\nNo, no! Burst in at once without a word!\nIn, and convict them by their dripping sword!\nELDER D.\nYes; that or something like it. Quick, I say,\nBe doing! ’Tis a time for no delay.\nELDER E.\nWe have time to think. This opening … They have planned\nSome scheme to make enslavement of the land.\nELDER F.\nYes, while we linger here! They take no thought\nOf lingering, and their sword-arm sleepeth not!\nELDER G.\nI have no counsel. I can speak not. Oh,\nLet him give counsel who can strike a blow!\nELDER H.\nI say as this man says. I have no trust\nIn words to raise a dead man from the dust.\nELDER I.\nHow mean you? Drag out our poor lives, and stand\nCowering to these defilers of the land?\nELDER J.\nNay, ’tis too much! Better to strive and die!\nDeath is an easier doom than slavery.\nELDER K.\nWe heard a sound of groaning, nothing plain,\nHow know we—are we seers?—that one is slain?\nELDER L.\nOh, let us find the truth out, ere we grow\nThus passionate! To surmise is not to know.\nLEADER.\nBreak in, then! ’Tis the counsel ye all bring,\nAnd learn for sure, how is it with the King.\n[They cluster up towards the Palace Door, as though to force an entrance, when the great Door swings open, revealing CLYTEMNESTRA, who stands, axe in hand, over the dead bodies of AGAMEMNON and CASSANDRA. The body of AGAMEMNON is wrapped in a rich crimson web. There is blood on CLYTEMNESTRA’S brow, and she speaks in wild triumph.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nOh, lies enough and more have I this day\nSpoken, which now I shame not to unsay.\nHow should a woman work, to the utter end,\nHate on a damnèd hater, feigned a friend;\nHow pile perdition round him, hunter-wise,\nToo high for overleaping, save by lies?\nTo me this hour was dreamed of long ago;\nA thing of ancient hate. ’Twas very slow\nIn coming, but it came. And here I stand\nEven where I struck, with all the deed I planned\nDone! ’Twas so wrought—what boots it to deny?—\nThe man could neither guard himself nor fly.\nAn endless web, as by some fisher strung,\nA deadly plenteousness of robe, I flung\nAll round him, and struck twice; and with two cries\nHis limbs turned water and broke; and as he lies\nI cast my third stroke in, a prayer well-sped\nTo Zeus of Hell, who guardeth safe his dead!\nSo there he gasped his life out as he lay;\nAnd, gasping, the blood spouted … Like dark spray\nThat splashed, it came, a salt and deathly dew;\nSweet, sweet as God’s dear rain-drops ever blew\nO’er a parched field, the day the buds are born! …\nWhich things being so, ye Councillors high-born,\nDepart in joy, if joy ye will. For me,\nI glory. Oh, if such a thing might be\nAs o’er the dead thank-offering to outpour,\nOn this dead it were just, aye, just and more,\nWho filled the cup of the House with treacheries\nCurse-fraught, and here hath drunk it to the lees!\nLEADER.\nWe are astonied at thy speech. To fling,\nWild mouth! such vaunt over thy murdered King!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nWouldst fright me, like a witless woman? Lo,\nThis bosom shakes not. And, though well ye know,\nI tell you … Curse me as ye will, or bless,\n’Tis all one … This is Agamemnon; this,\nMy husband, dead by my right hand, a blow\nStruck by a righteous craftsman. Aye, ’tis so.\nCHORUS.\nWoman, what evil tree,\nWhat poison grown of the ground\nOr draught of the drifting sea\nWay to thy lips hath found,\nMaking thee clothe thy heart\nIn rage, yea, in curses burning\nWhen thine own people pray?\nThou hast hewn, thou hast cast away;\nAnd a thing cast away thou art,\nA thing of hate and a spurning!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, now, for me, thou hast thy words of fate;\nExile from Argos and the people’s hate\nFor ever! Against him no word was cried,\nWhen, recking not, as ’twere a beast that died,\nWith flocks abounding o’er his wide domain,\nHe slew his child, my love, my flower of pain, …\nGreat God, as magic for the winds of Thrace!\nWhy was not he man-hunted from his place,\nTo purge the blood that stained him? … When the deed\nIs mine, oh, then thou art a judge indeed!\nBut threat thy fill. I am ready, and I stand\nContent; if thy hand beateth down my hand,\nThou rulest. If aught else be God’s decree,\nThy lesson shall be learned, though late it be.\nCHORUS.\nThy thought, it is very proud;\nThy breath is the scorner’s breath;\nIs not the madness loud\nIn thy heart, being drunk with death?\nYea, and above thy brow\nA star of the wet blood burneth!\nOh, doom shall have yet her day,\nThe last friend cast away,\nWhen lie doth answer lie\nAnd a stab for a stab returneth!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd heark what Oath-gods gather to my side!\nBy my dead child’s Revenge, now satisfied,\nBy Mortal Blindness, by all Powers of Hell\nWhich Hate, to whom in sacrifice he fell,\nMy Hope shall walk not in the house of Fear,\nWhile on my hearth one fire yet burneth clear,\nOne lover, one Aigisthos, as of old!\nWhat should I fear, when fallen here I hold\nThis foe, this scorner of his wife, this toy\nAnd fool of each Chryseis under Troy;\nAnd there withal his soothsayer and slave,\nHis chanting bed-fellow, his leman brave,\nWho rubbed the galleys’ benches at his side.\nBut, oh, they had their guerdon as they died!\nFor he lies thus, and she, the wild swan’s way,\nHath trod her last long weeping roundelay,\nAnd lies, his lover, ravisht o’er the main\nFor his bed’s comfort and my deep disdain.\nCHORUS. (Some Elders.)\nWould God that suddenly\nWith no great agony,\nNo long sick-watch to keep,\nMy hour would come to me,\nMy hour, and presently\nBring the eternal, the\nUnwaking Sleep,\nNow that my Shepherd, he\nWhose love watched over me,\nLies in the deep!\nANOTHER.\nFor woman’s sake he endured and battled well,\nAnd by a woman’s hand he fell.\nOTHERS.\nWhat hast thou done, O Helen blind of brain,\nO face that slew the souls on Ilion’s plain,\nOne face, one face, and many a thousand slain?\nThe hate of old that on this castle lay,\nBuilded in lust, a husband’s evil day,\nHath bloomed for thee a perfect flower again\nAnd unforgotten, an old and burning stain\nNever to pass away.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNay, pray not for the hour of death, being tried\nToo sore beneath these blows\nNeither on Helen turn thy wrath aside,\nThe Slayer of Men, the face which hath destroyed\nIts thousand Danaan souls, and wrought a wide\nWound that no leech can close.\nCHORUS.\n—Daemon, whose heel is set\nOn the House and the twofold kin\nOf the high Tantalidae,\nA power, heavy as fate,\nThou wieldest through woman’s sin,\nPiercing the heart of me!\n—Like a raven swoln with hate\nHe hath set on the dead his claw,\nHe croaketh a song to sate\nHis fury, and calls it Law!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAh, call upon Him! Yea, call—\nAnd thy thought hath found its path—\nThe Daemon who haunts this hall,\nThe thrice-engorged Wrath;\nFrom him is the ache of the flesh\nFor blood born and increased;\nEre the old sore hath ceased\nIt oozeth afresh.\nCHORUS.\n—Indeed He is very great,\nAnd heavy his anger, He,\nThe Daemon who guides the fate\nOf the old Tantalidae:\nAlas, alas, an evil tale ye tell\nOf desolate angers and insatiable!\n—Ah me,\nAnd yet ’tis all as Zeus hath willed,\nDoer of all and Cause of all;\nBy His Word every chance doth fall,\nNo end without Him is fulfilled;\nWhat of these things\nBut cometh by high Heaven’s counsellings?\n[A band of Mourners has gathered within the House.]\nMOURNERS.\nAh, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!\nHow shall I weep, what word shall I say?\nCaught in the web of this spider thing,\nIn foul death gasping thy life away!\nWoe’s me, woe’s me, for this slavish lying,\nThe doom of craft and the lonely dying,\nThe iron two-edged and the hands that slay!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd criest thou still this deed hath been\nMy work?

It cannot be,\nYet from the deeps of ancient sin\nThe Avenger may have wrought with thee.\n—On the red Slayer crasheth, groping wild\nFor blood, more blood, to build his peace again,\nAnd wash like water the old frozen stain\nOf the torn child.\nMOURNERS.\nAh, sorrow, sorrow! My King, my King!\nHow shall I weep, what word shall I say?\nCaught in the web of this spider thing,\nIn foul death gasping thy life away.\nWoe’s me, woe’s me, for this slavish lying,\nThe doom of craft and the lonely dying,\nThe iron two-edged and the hands that slay!\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAnd what of the doom of craft that first\nHe planted, making the House accurst?\nWhat of the blossom, from this root riven,\nIphigenîa, the unforgiven?\nEven as the wrong was, so is the pain:\nHe shall not laugh in the House of the slain,\nWhen the count is scored;\nHe hath but spoilèd and paid again\nThe due of the sword.\nCHORUS.\nI am lost; my mind dull-eyed\nKnows not nor feels\nWhither to fly nor hide\nWhile the House reels.\nThe noise of rain that falls\nOn the roof affrighteth me,\nWashing away the walls;\nRain that falls bloodily.\nDoth ever the sound abate?\nLo, the next Hour of Fate\nWhetting her vengeance due\nOn new whet-stones, for new\nWorkings of hate.\nMOURNERS.\nWould thou hadst covered me, Earth, O Earth,\nOr e’er I had looked on my lord thus low,\nIn the pallèd marble of silvern girth!\nWhat hands may shroud him, what tears may flow?\nNot thine, O Woman who dared to slay him,\nThou durst not weep to him now, nor pray him,\nNor pay to his soul the deep unworth\nOf gift or prayer to forget thy blow.\n—Oh, who with heart sincere\nShall bring praise or grief\nTo lay on the sepulchre\nOf the great chief?\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nHis burial is not thine to array.\nBy me he fell, by me he died,\nI watch him to the grave, not cried\nBy mourners of his housefolk; nay,\nHis own child for a day like this\nWaits, as is seemly, and shall run\nBy the white waves of Acheron\nTo fold him in her arms and kiss!\nCHORUS.\nLo, she who was erst reviled\nRevileth; and who shall say?\nSpoil taken from them that spoiled,\nLife-blood from them that slay!\nSurely while God ensueth\nHis laws, while Time doth run\n’Tis written: On him that doeth\nIt shall be done.\nThis is God’s law and grace,\nWho then shall hunt the race\nOf curses from out this hall?\nThe House is sealed withal\nTo dreadfulness.\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nAye, thou hast found the Law, and stept\nIn Truth’s way.—Yet even now I call\nThe Living Wrath which haunts this hall\nTo truce and compact. I accept\nAll the affliction he doth heap\nUpon me, and I charge him go\nFar off with his self-murdering woe\nTo strange men’s houses. I will keep\nSome little dower, and leave behind\nAll else, contented utterly.\nI have swept the madness from the sky\nWherein these brethren slew their kind.\n[As she ceases, exhausted and with the fire gone out of her, AIGISTHOS, with Attendants, bursts triumphantly in.]\nAIGISTHOS.\nO shining day, O dawn of righteousness\nFulfilled! Now, now indeed will I confess\nThat divine watchers o’er man’s death and birth\nLook down on all the anguish of the earth,\nNow that I see him lying, as I love\nTo see him, in this net the Furies wove,\nTo atone the old craft of his father’s hand.\nFor Atreus, this man’s father, in this land\nReigning, and by Thyestes in his throne\nChallenged—he was his brother and mine own\nFather From home and city cast him out;\nAnd he, after long exile, turned about\nAnd threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won\nPromise of so much mercy, that his own\nLife-blood should reek not in his father’s hall.\nThen did that godless brother, Atreus, call,\nTo greet my sire—More eagerness, O God,\nWas there than love!—a feast of brotherhood.\nAnd, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat\nBefore him his dead children. The white feet\nAnd finger-fringèd hands apart he set,\nVeiled from all seeing, and made separate\nThe tables. And he straightway, knowing naught,\nTook of those bodies, eating that which wrought\nNo health for all his race. And when he knew\nThe unnatural deed, back from the board he threw,\nSpewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake\nThe table, to make strong the curse he spake:\n“Thus perish all of Pleisthenês begot!”\nFor that lies this man here; and all the plot\nIs mine, most righteously. For me, the third,\nWhen butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared\nAnd cast me with my broken sire that day,\nA little thing in swaddling clothes, away\nTo exile; where I grew, and at the last\nJustice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast\nIn a far land, mine arm hath reached this king;\nMy brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling;\nAnd all is well. I have seen mine enemy\nDead in the snare, and care not if I die!\nLEADER.\nAigisthos, to insult over the dead\nI like not. All the counsel, thou hast said,\nWas thine alone; and thine the will that spilled\nThis piteous blood. As justice is fulfilled,\nThou shalt not ’scape—so my heart presageth—-The\nday of cursing and the hurlèd death.\nAIGISTHOS.\nHow, thou poor oarsman of the nether row,\nWhen the main deck is master? Sayst thou so?…\nTo such old heads the lesson may prove hard,\nI fear me, when Obedience is the word.\nBut hunger, and bonds, and cold, help men to find\nTheir wits.—They are wondrous healers of the mind!\nHast eyes and seest not this?—Against a spike\nKick not, for fear it pain thee if thou strike.\nLEADER (turning from him to CLYTEMNESTRA).\nWoman! A soldier fresh from war! To keep\nWatch o’er his house and shame him in his sleep…\nTo plot this craft against a lord of spears…\n[CLYTEMNESTRA, as though in a dream, pays no heed. AIGISTHOS interupts.]\nAIGISTHOS.\nThese be the words, old man, that lead to tears!\nThou hast an opposite to Orpheus’ tongue,\nWho chained all things with his enchanting song,\nFor thy mad noise will put the chains on thee.\nEnough! Once mastered thou shalt tamer be.\nLEADER.\nThou master? Is old Argos so accurst?\nThou plotter afar off, who never durst\nRaise thine own hand to affront and strike him down…\nAIGISTHOS.\nTo entice him was the wife’s work. I was known\nBy all men here, his old confessed blood-foe.\nHowbeit, with his possessions I will know\nHow to be King. And who obeys not me\nShall be yoked hard, no easy trace-horse he,\nCorn-flushed. Hunger, and hunger’s prison mate,\nThe clammy murk, shall see his rage abate.\nLEADER.\nThou craven soul! Why not in open strife\nSlay him? Why lay the blood-sin on his wife,\nStaining the Gods of Argos, making ill\nThe soil thereof?…But young Orestes still\nLiveth. Oh, Fate will guide him home again,\nAvenging, conquering, home to kill these twain!\nAIGISTHOS.\n’Fore God, if ’tis your pleasure thus to speak and do, ye soon shall hear!\nHo there, my trusty pikes, advance!

Stand and be ready, sword from sheath!\nAIGISTHOS.\nBy Heaven, I also, sword in hand, am ready, and refuse not death!\nLEADER.\nCome, find it! We accept thy word. Thou offerest what we hunger for.\n[Some of the Elders draw swords with the Leader; others have collapsed with weakness. Men from AGAMEMNON’S retinue have gathered and prepare for battle, when, before they can come to blows, CLYTEMNESTRA breaks from her exhausted silence.]\nCLYTEMNESTRA.\nNay, peace, O best-belovèd! Peace! And let us work no evil more.\nSurely the reaping of the past is a full harvest, and not good,\nAnd wounds enough are everywhere.—Let us not stain ourselves with blood.\nYe reverend Elders, go your ways, to his own dwelling every one,\nEre things be wrought for which men suffer.—What we did must needs be done.\nAnd if of all these strifes we now may have no more, oh, I will kneel\nAnd praise God, bruisèd though we be beneath the Daemon’s heavy heel.\nThis is the word a woman speaks, to hear if any man will deign.\nAIGISTHOS.\nAnd who are these to burst in flower of folly thus of tongue and brain,\nAnd utter words of empty sound and perilous, tempting Fortune’s frown,\nAnd leave wise counsel all forgot, and gird at him who wears the crown?\nLEADER.\nTo cringe before a caitiff’s crown, it squareth not with Argive ways.\nAIGISTHOS.

    "content":"THE LIBATION-BEARERS\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nORESTES\nCHORUS OF CAPTIVE WOMEN\nELECTRA\nA NURSE\nCLYTEMNESTRA\nAEGISTHUS\nAN ATTENDANT\nPYLADES\nThe Scene is the Tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae; afterwards, the Palace of Atreus, hard by the Tomb.\nOrestes\nLord of the shades and patron of the realm\nThat erst my father swayed, list now my prayer,\nHermes, and save me with thine aiding arm,\nMe who from banishment returning stand\nOn this my country; lo, my foot is set\nOn this grave-mound, and herald-like, as thou,\nOnce and again, I bid my father hear.\nAnd these twin locks, from mine head shorn, I bring,\nAnd one to Inachus the river-god,\nMy young life’s nurturer, I dedicate,\nAnd one in sign of mourning unfulfilled\nI lay, though late, on this my father’s grave.\nFor O my father, not beside thy corse\nStood I to wail thy death, nor was my hand\nStretched out to bear thee forth to burial.\nWhat sight is yonder? what this woman-throng\nHitherward coming, by their sable garb\nMade manifest as mourners? What hath chanced?\nDoth some new sorrow hap within the home?\nOr rightly may I deem that they draw near\nBearing libations, such as soothe the ire\nOf dead men angered, to my father’s grave?\nNay, such they are indeed; for I descry\nElectra mine own sister pacing hither,\nIn moody grief conspicuous. Grant, O Zeus,\nGrant me my father’s murder to avenge—\nBe thou my willing champion!\nPylades,\nPass we aside, till rightly I discern\nWherefore these women throng in suppliance.\n[Exeunt Pylades and Orestes; enter the Chorus bearing vessels for libation; Electra follows them; they pace slowly towards the tomb of Agamemnon.\nCHORUS\nForth from the royal halls by high command\nI bear libations for the dead.\nRings on my smitten breast my smiting hand,\nAnd all my cheek is rent and red,\nFresh-furrowed by my nails, and all my soul\nThis many a day doth feed on cries of dole.\nAnd trailing tatters of my vest,\nIn looped and windowed raggedness forlorn,\nHang rent around my breast,\nEven as I, by blows of Fate most stern\nSaddened and torn.\nOracular thro’ visions, ghastly clear,\nBearing a blast of wrath from realms below,\nAnd stiffening each rising hair with dread,\nCame out of dream-land Fear,\nAnd, loud and awful, bade\nThe shriek ring out at midnight’s witching hour,\nAnd brooded, stern with woe,\nAbove the inner house, the woman’s bower.\nAnd seers inspired did read the dream on oath,\nChanting aloud In realms below\nThe dead are wroth;\nAgainst their slayers yet their ire doth glow.\nTherefore to bear this gift of graceless worth—\nO Earth, my nursing mother!—\nThe woman god-accurs’d doth send me forth\nLest one crime bring another.\nIll is the very word to speak, for none\nCan ransom or atone\nFor blood once shed and darkening the plain.\nO hearth of woe and bane,\nO state that low doth lie!\nSunless, accursed of men, the shadows brood\nAbove the home of murdered majesty.\nRumour of might, unquestioned, unsubdued,\nPervading ears and soul of lesser men,\nIs silent now and dead.\nYet rules a viler dread;\nFor bliss and power, however won,\nAs gods, and more than gods, dazzle our mortal ken.\nJustice doth mark, with scales that swiftly sway,\nSome that are yet in light;\nOthers in interspace of day and night,\nTill Fate arouse them, stay;\nAnd some are lapped in night, where all things are undone.\nOn the life-giving lap of Earth\nBlood hath flowed forth;\nAnd now, the seed of vengeance, clots the plain—\nUnmelting, uneffaced the stain.\nAnd Atè tarries long, but at the last\nThe sinner’s heart is cast\nInto pervading, waxing pangs of pain.\nLo, when man’s force doth ope\nThe virgin doors, there is nor cure nor hope\nFor what is lost,—even so, I deem,\nThough in one channel ran Earth’s every stream,\nLaving the hand defiled from murder’s stain,\nIt were vain.\nAnd upon me—ah me!—the gods have laid\nThe woe that wrapped round Troy,\nWhat time they led down from home and kin\nUnto a slave’s employ—\nThe doom to bow the head\nAnd watch our master’s will\nWork deeds of good and ill—\nTo see the headlong sway of force and sin,\nAnd hold restrained the spirit’s bitter hate,\nWailing the monarch’s fruitless fate,\nHiding my face within my robe, and fain\nOf tears, and chilled with frost of hidden pain.\nELECTRA\nHand maidens, orderers of the palace-halls,\nSince at my side ye come, a suppliant train,\nCompanions of this offering, counsel me\nAs best befits the time: for I, who pour\nUpon the grave these streams funereal,\nWith what fair word can I invoke my sire?\nShall I aver, Behold, I bear these gifts\nFrom well-beloved wife unto her well-beloved lord,\nWhen ’tis from her, my mother, that they come?\nI dare not say it: of all words I fail\nWherewith to consecrate unto my sire\nThese sacrificial honours on his grave.\nOr shall I speak this word, as mortals use—\nGive back, to those who send these coronals\nFull recompense—of ills for acts malign?\nOr shall I pour this draught for Earth to drink,\nSans word or reverence, as my sire was slain,\nAnd homeward pass with unreverted eyes,\nCasting the bowl away, as one who flings\nThe household cleansings to the common road?\nBe art and part, O friends, in this my doubt,\nEven as ye are in that one common hate\nWhereby we live attended: fear ye not\nThe wrath of any man, nor hide your word\nWithin your breast: the day of death and doom\nAwaits alike the freeman and the slave.\nSpeak, then, if aught thou know’st to aid us more.\nCHORUS\nThou biddest; I will speak my soul’s thought out,\nRevering as a shrine thy father’s grave.\nELECTRA\nSay then thy say, as thou his tomb reverest.\nCHORUS\nSpeak solemn words to them that love, and pour.\nELECTRA\nAnd of his kin whom dare I name as kind?\nCHORUS\nThyself; and next, whoe’er Aegisthus scorns.\nELECTRA\nThen ’tis myself and thou, my prayer must name.\nCHORUS\nWhoe’er they be, ’tis thine to know and name them.\nELECTRA\nIs there no other we may claim as ours?\nCHORUS\nThink of Orestes, though far-off he be.\nELECTRA\nRight well in this too hast thou schooled my thought.\nCHORUS\nMindfully, next, on those who shed the blood—\nELECTRA\nPray on them what? expound, instruct my doubt.\nCHORUS\nThis; Upon them some god or mortal come——\nELECTRA\nAs judge or as avenger? speak thy thought.\nCHORUS\nPray in set terms, Who shall the slayer slay.\nELECTRA\nBeseemeth it to ask such boon of heaven?\nCHORUS\nHow not, to wreak a wrong upon a foe?\nELECTRA\nO mighty Hermes, warder of the shades,\nHerald of upper and of under world,\nProclaim and usher down my prayer’s appeal\nUnto the gods below, that they with eyes\nWatchful behold these halls, my sire’s of old—\nAnd unto Earth, the mother of all things,\nAnd foster-nurse, and womb that takes their seed.\nLo, I that pour these draughts for men now dead,\nCall on my father, who yet holds in ruth\nMe and mine own Orestes, Father, speak—\nHow shall thy children rule thine halls again?\nHomeless we are and sold; and she who sold\nIs she who bore us; and the price she took\nIs he who joined with her to work thy death,\nAegisthus, her new lord. Behold me here\nBrought down to slave’s estate, and far away\nWanders Orestes, banished from the wealth\nThat once was thine, the profit of thy care,\nWhereon these revel in a shameful joy.\nFather, my prayer is said; ’tis thine to hear—\nGrant that some fair fate bring Orestes home,\nAnd unto me grant these—a purer soul\nThan is my mother’s, a more stainless hand.\nThese be my prayers for us; for thee, O sire,\nI cry that one may come to smite thy foes,\nAnd that the slayers may in turn be slain.\nCursed is their prayer, and thus I bar its path,\nPraying mine own, a counter-curse on them.\nAnd thou, send up to us the righteous boon\nFor which we pray: thine aids be heaven and earth,\nAnd justice guide the right to victory,\n[To the Chorus.\nThus have I prayed, and thus I shed these streams,\nAnd follow ye the wont, and as with flowers\nCrown ye with many a tear and cry the dirge,\nYour lips ring out above the dead man’s grave.\n[She pours the libations.\nCHORUS\nWoe, woe, woe!\nLet the teardrop fall, plashing on the ground\nWhere our lord lies low:\nFall and cleanse away the cursed libation’s stain,\nShed on this grave-mound,\nFenced wherein together, gifts of good or bane\nFrom the dead are found.\nLord of Argos, hearken!\nThough around thee darken\nMist of death and hell, arise and hear!\nHearken and awaken to our cry of woe!\nWho with might of spear\nShall our home deliver?\nWho like Ares bend until it quiver,\nBend the northern bow?\nWho with hand upon the hilt himself will thrust with glaive,\nThrust and slay and save?\nELECTRA\nLo! the earth drinks them, to my sire they pass—\nLearn ye with me of this thing new and strange.\nCHORUS\nSpeak thou; my breast doth palpitate with fear.\nELECTRA\nI see upon the tomb a curl new shorn.\nCHORUS\nShorn from what man or what deep-girded maid?\nELECTRA\nThat may he guess who will; the sign is plain.\nCHORUS\nLet me learn this of thee; let youth prompt age.\nELECTRA\nNone is there here but I, to clip such gift.\nCHORUS\nFor they who thus should mourn him hate him sore.\nELECTRA\nAnd lo! in truth the hair exceeding like—\nCHORUS\nLike to what locks and whose? instruct me that.\nELECTRA\nLike unto those my father’s children wear.\nCHORUS\nThen is this lock Orestes’ secret gift?\nELECTRA\nMost like it is unto the curls he wore,\nCHORUS\nYet how dared he to come unto his home?\nELECTRA\nHe hath but sent it, clipt to mourn his sire.\nCHORUS\nIt is a sorrow grievous as his death,\nThat he should live yet never dare return.\nELECTRA\nYea, and my heart o’erflows with gall of grief,\nAnd I am pierced as with a cleaving dart;\nLike to the first drops after drought, my tears\nFall down at will, a bitter bursting tide,\nAs on this lock I gaze; I cannot deem\nThat any Argive save Orestes’ self\nWas ever lord thereof; nor, well I wot,\nHath she, the murd’ress, shorn and laid this lock\nTo mourn him whom she slew—my mother she,\nBearing no mother’s heart, but to her race\nA loathing spirit, loathed itself of heaven!\nYet to affirm, as utterly made sure,\nThat this adornment cometh of the hand\nOf mine Orestes, brother of my soul,\nI may not venture, yet hope flatters fair!\nAh well-a-day, that this dumb hair had voice\nTo glad mine ears, as might a messenger,\nBidding me sway no more ’twixt fear and hope,\nClearly commanding, Cast me hence away,\nClipped was I from some head thou lovest not;\nOr, I am kin to thee, and here, as thou,\nI come to weep and deck our father’s grave.\nAid me, ye gods! for well indeed ye know\nHow in the gale and counter-gale of doubt,\nLike to the seaman’s bark, we whirl and stray.\nBut, if God will our life, how strong shall spring,\nFrom seed how small, the new tree of our home!—\nLo ye, a second sign—these footsteps, look,—\nLike to my own, a corresponsive print;\nAnd look, another footmark,—this his own,\nAnd that the foot of one who walked with him.\nMark, how the heel and tendons’ print combine,\nMeasured exact, with mine coincident!\nAlas! for doubt and anguish rack my mind.\nORESTES (approaching suddenly)\nPray thou, in gratitude for prayers fulfilled, Fair fall the rest of what I ask of heaven.\nELECTRA\nWherefore? what win I from the gods by prayer?\nORESTES\nThis, that thine eyes behold thy heart’s desire.\nELECTRA\nOn whom of mortals know’st thou that I call?\nORESTES\nI know thy yearning for Orestes deep.\nELECTRA\nSay then, wherein event hath crowned my prayer?\nORESTES\nI, I am he; seek not one more akin.\nELECTRA\nSome fraud, O stranger, weavest thou for me?\nORESTES\nAgainst myself I weave it, if I weave.\nELECTRA\nAh, thou hast mind to mock me in my woe!\nORESTES\n’Tis at mine own I mock then, mocking thine.\nELECTRA\nSpeak I with thee then as Orestes’ self?\nORESTES\nMy very face thou see’st and know’st me not,\nAnd yet but now, when thou didst see the lock\nShorn for my father’s grave, and when thy quest\nWas eager on the footprints I had made,\nEven I, thy brother, shaped and sized as thou,\nFluttered thy spirit, as at sight of me!\nLay now this ringlet whence ’twas shorn, and judge,\nAnd look upon this robe, thine own hands’ work,\nThe shuttle-prints, the creature wrought thereon—\nRefrain thyself, nor prudence lose in joy,\nFor well I wot, our kin are less than kind.\nELECTRA\nO thou that art unto our father’s home\nLove, grief and hope, for thee the tears ran down,\nFor thee, the son, the saviour that should be;\nTrust thou thine arm and win thy father’s halls!\nO aspect sweet of fourfold love to me,\nWhom upon thee the heart’s constraint bids call\nAs on my father, and the claim of love\nFrom me unto my mother turns to thee,\nFor she is very hate; to thee too turns\nWhat of my heart went out to her who died\nA ruthless death upon the altar-stone;\nAnd for myself I love thee—thee that wast\nA brother leal, sole stay of love to me.\nNow by thy side be strength and right, and Zeus\nSaviour almighty, stand to aid the twain!\nORESTES\nZeus, Zeus! look down on our estate and us,\nThe orphaned brood of him, our eagle-sire,\nWhom to his death a fearful serpent brought\nEnwinding him in coils; and we, bereft\nAnd foodless, sink with famine, all too weak\nTo bear unto the eyrie, as he bore,\nSuch quarry as he slew. Lo! I and she,\nElectra, stand before thee, fatherless,\nAnd each alike cast out and homeless made.\nELECTRA\nAnd if thou leave to death the brood of him\nWhose altar blazed for thee, whose reverence\nWas thine, all thine,—whence, in the after years,\nShall any hand like his adorn thy shrine\nWith sacrifice of flesh? the eaglets slain,\nThou wouldst not have a messenger to bear\nThine omens, once so clear, to mortal men;\nSo, if this kingly stock be withered all,\nNone on high festivals will fend thy shrine\nStoop thou to raise us! strong the race shall show,\nThough puny now it seem, and fallen low.\nCHORUS\nO children, saviours of your father’s home,\nBeware ye of your words, lest one should hear\nAnd bear them, for the tongue hath lust to tell,\nUnto our masters—whom God grant to me\nIn pitchy reek of fun’ral flame to see!\nORESTES\nNay, mighty is Apollo’s oracle\nAnd shall not fail me, whom it bade to pass\nThro’ all this peril; clear the voice rang out\nWith many warnings, sternly threatening\nTo my hot heart the wintry chill of pain,\nUnless upon the slayers of my sire\nI pressed for vengeance: this the god’s command—\nThat I, in ire for home and wealth despoiled,\nShould with a craft like theirs the slayers slay:\nElse with my very life I should atone\nThis deed undone, in many a ghastly wise\nFor he proclaimed unto the ears of men\nThat offerings, poured to angry power of death,\nExude again, unless their will be done,\nAs grim disease on those that poured them forth—\nAs leprous ulcers mounting on the flesh\nAnd with fell fangs corroding what of old\nWore natural form; and on the brow arise\nWhite poisoned hairs, the crown of this disease.\nHe spake moreover of assailing fiends\nEmpowered to quit on me my father’s blood,\nWreaking their wrath on me, what time in night\nBeneath shut lids the spirit’s eye sees clear.\nThe dart that flies in darkness, sped from hell\nBy spirits of the murdered dead who call\nUnto their kin for vengeance, formless fear,\nThe night-tide’s visitant, and madness’ curse\nShould drive and rack me; and my tortured frame\nShould be chased forth from man’s community\nAs with the brazen scorpions of the scourge.\nFor me and such as me no lustral bowl\nShould stand, no spilth of wine be poured to God\nFor me, and wrath unseen of my dead sire\nShould drive me from the shrine; no man should dare\nTo take me to his hearth, nor dwell with me:\nSlow, friendless, cursed of all should be mine end,\nAnd pitiless horror wind me for the grave,\nThis spake the god—this dare I disobey?\nYea, though I dared, the deed must yet be done;\nFor to that end diverse desires combine,—\nThe god’s behest, deep grief for him who died,\nAnd last, the grievous blank of wealth despoiled—\nAll these weigh on me, urge that Argive men,\nMinions of valour, who with soul of fire\nDid make of fencèd Troy a ruinous heap,\nBe not left slaves to two and each a woman!\nFor he, the man, wears woman’s heart; if not\nSoon shall he know, confronted by a man.\n[Orestes, Electra, and the Chorus gather round the tomb of Agamemnon for the invocation which follows.\nCHORUS\nMighty Fates, on you we call!\nBid the will of Zeus ordain\nPower to those, to whom again\nJustice turns with hand and aid!\nGrievous was the prayer one made—\nGrievous let the answer fall!\nWhere the mighty doom is set,\nJustice claims aloud her debt\nWho in blood hath dipped the steel,\nDeep in blood her meed shall feel!\nList an immemorial word—\nWhosoe’er shall take the sword\nShall perish by the sword.\nORESTES\nFather, unblest in death, O father mine!\nWhat breath of word or deed\nCan I waft on thee from this far confine\nUnto thy lowly bed,—\nWaft upon thee, in midst of darkness lying,\nHope’s counter-gleam of fire?\nYet the loud dirge of praise brings grace undying\nUnto each parted sire.\nCHORUS\nO child, the spirit of the dead,\nAltho’ upon his flesh have fed\nThe grim teeth of the flame,\nIs quelled not; after many days\nThe sting of wrath his soul shall raise,\nA vengeance to reclaim!\nTo the dead rings loud our cry—\nPlain the living’s treachery—\nSwelling, shrilling, urged on high,\nThe vengeful dirge, for parents slain,\nShall strive and shall attain.\nELECTRA\nHear me too, even me, O father, hear!\nNot by one child alone these groans, these tears are shed\nUpon thy sepulchre.\nEach, each, where thou art lowly laid,\nStands, a suppliant, homeless made:\nAh, and all is full of ill,\nComfort is there none to say!\nStrive and wrestle as we may,\nStill stands doom invincible.\nCHORUS\nNay, if so he will, the god\nStill our tears to joy can turn\nHe can bid a triumph-ode\nDrown the dirge beside this urn;\nHe to kingly halls can greet\nThe child restored, the homeward-guided feet.\nORESTES\nAh my father! hadst thou lain\nUnder Ilion’s wall,\nBy some Lycian spearman slain,\nThou hadst left in this thine hall\nHonour; thou hadst wrought for us\nFame and life most glorious.\nOver-seas if thou had’st died,\nHeavily had stood thy tomb,\nHeaped on high; but, quenched in pride,\nGrief were light unto thy home.\nCHORUS\nLoved and honoured hadst thou lain\nBy the dead that nobly fell,\nIn the under-world again,\nWhere are throned the kings of hell,\nFull of sway adorable\nThou hadst stood at their right hand—\nThou that wert, in mortal land,\nBy Fate’s ordinance and law,\nKing of kings who bear the crown\nAnd the staff, to which in awe\nMortal men bow down.\nELECTRA\nNay O father, I were fain\nOther fate had fallen on thee.\nIll it were if thou hadst lain\nOne among the common slain,\nFallen by Scamander’s side—\nThose who slew thee there should be!\nThen, untouched by slavery,\nWe had heard as from afar\nDeaths of those who should have died\n’Mid the chance of war.\nCHORUS\nO child, forbear! things all too high thou sayest.\nEasy, but vain, thy cry!\nA boon above all gold is that thou prayest,\nAn unreached destiny,\nAs of the blessèd land that far aloof\nBeyond the north wind lies;\nYet doth your double prayer ring loud reproof;\nA double scourge of sighs\nAwakes the dead; th’ avengers rise, though late;\nBlood stains the guilty pride\nOf the accursed who rule on earth, and Fate\nStands on the children’s side.\nELECTRA\nThat hath sped thro’ mine ear, like a shaft from a bow!\nZeus, Zeus! it is thou who dost send from below\nA doom on the desperate doer—ere long\nOn a mother a father shall visit his wrong.\nCHORUS\nBe it mine to upraise thro’ the reek of the pyre\nThe chant of delight, while the funeral fire\nDevoureth the corpse of a man that is slain\nAnd a woman laid low!\nFor who bids me conceal it! out-rending control,\nBlows ever stern blast of hate thro’ my soul,\nAnd before me a vision of wrath and of bane\nFlits and waves to and fro.\nORESTES\nZeus, thou alone to us art parent now.\nSmite with a rending blow\nUpon their heads, and bid the land be well:\nSet right where wrong hath stood; and thou give ear,\nO Earth, unto my prayer—\nYea, hear O mother Earth, and monarchy of hell!\nCHORUS\nNay, the law is sternly set—\nBlood-drops shed upon the ground\nPlead for other bloodshed yet;\nLoud the call of death doth sound,\nCalling guilt of olden time,\nA Fury, crowning crime with crime.\nELECTRA\nWhere, where are ye, avenging powers,\nPuissant Furies of the slain?\nBehold the relics of the race\nOf Atreus, thrust from pride of place!\nO Zeus, what home henceforth is ours,\nWhat refuge to attain?\nCHORUS\nLo, at your wail my heart throbs, wildly stirred;\nNow am I lorn with sadness,\nDarkened in all my soul, to hear your sorrow’s word.\nAnon to hope, the seat of strength, I rise,—\nShe, thrusting grief away, lifts up mine eyes\nTo the new dawn of gladness.\nORESTES\nSkills it to tell of aught save wrong on wrong,\nWrought by our mother’s deed?\nThough now she fawn for pardon, sternly strong\nStandeth our wrath, and will nor hear nor heed;\nHer children’s soul is wolfish, born from hers,\nAnd softens not by prayers.\nCHORUS\nI dealt upon my breast the blow\nThat Asian mourning women know;\nWails from my breast the fun’ral cry,\nThe Cissian weeping melody;\nStretched rendingly forth, to tatter and tear,\nMy clenched hands wander, here and there,\nFrom head to breast; distraught with blows\nThrob dizzily my brows.\nELECTRA\nAweless in hate, O mother, sternly brave!\nAs in a foeman’s grave\nThou laid’st in earth a king, but to the bier\nNo citizen drew near,—\nThy husband, thine, yet for his obsequies,\nThou bad’st no wail arise!\nORESTES\nAlas the shameful burial thou dost speak!\nYet I the vengeance of his shame will wreak—\nThat do the gods command!\nThat shall achieve mine hand!\nGrant me to thrust her life away, and I\nWill dare to die!\nCHORUS\nList thou the deed!

I now stand here,\nMade glad, made sad with blood, exulting, wailing—\nHear, O thou woven web that slew my sire!\nI grieve for deed and death and all my home—\nVictor, pollution’s damnèd stain for prize.\nCHORUS\nAlas, that none of mortal men\nCan pass his life untouched by pain!\nBehold, one woe is here—\nAnother loometh near.\nORESTES\nHark ye and learn—for what the end shall be\nFor me I know not: breaking from the curb\nMy spirit whirls me off, a conquered prey,\nBorne as a charioteer by steeds distraught\nFar from the course, and madness in my breast\nBurneth to chant its song, and leap, and rave—\nHark ye and learn, friends, ere my reason goes!\nI say that rightfully I slew my mother,\nA thing God-scorned, that foully slew my sire\nAnd chiefest wizard of the spell that bound me\nUnto this deed I name the Pythian seer\nApollo, who foretold that if I slew,\nThe guilt of murder done should pass from me;\nBut if I spared, the fate that should be mine\nI dare not blazon forth—the bow of speech\nCan reach not to the mark, that doom to tell.\nAnd now behold me, how with branch and crown\nI pass, a suppliant made meet to go\nUnto Earth’s midmost shrine, the holy ground\nOf Loxias, and that renownèd light\nOf ever-burning fire, to ’scape the doom\nOf kindred murder: to no other shrine\n(So Loxias bade) may I for refuge turn.\nBear witness, Argives, in the after time,\nHow came on me this dread fatality.\nLiving, I pass a banished wanderer hence,\nTo leave in death the memory of this cry.\nCHORUS\nNay, but the deed is well; link not thy lips\nTo speech ill-starred, nor vent ill-boding words—\nWho hast to Argos her full freedom given,\nLopping two serpents’ heads with timely blow.\nORESTES\nLook, look, alas!\nHandmaidens, see—what Gorgon shapes throng up;\nDusky their robes and all their hair enwound—\nSnakes coiled with snakes—off, off, I must away!\nCHORUS\nMost loyal of all sons unto thy sire,\nWhat visions thus distract thee? Hold, abide;\nGreat was thy victory, and shalt thou fear?\nORESTES\nThese are no dreams, void shapes of haunting ill,\nBut clear to sight my mother’s hell-hounds come!\nCHORUS\nNay, the fresh bloodshed still imbrues thine hands,\nAnd thence distraction sinks into thy soul.\nORESTES\nO king Apollo—see, they swarm and throng—\nBlack blood of hatred dripping from their eyes!\nCHORUS\nOne remedy thou hast; go, touch the shrine\nOf Loxias, and rid thee of these woes.\nORESTES\nYe can behold them not, but I behold them.\nUp and away! I dare abide no more.\n[Exit\nCHORUS\nFarewell then as thou mayst,—the god thy friend\nGuard thee and aid with chances favouring.\nBehold, the storm of woe divine\nThat the raves and beats on Atreus’ line\nIts great third blast hath blown.\nFirst was Thyestes’ loathly woe—\nThe rueful feast of long ago,\nOn children’s flesh, unknown.\nAnd next the kingly chief’s despite,\nWhen he who led the Greeks to fight\nWas in the bath hewn down.\nAnd now the offspring of the race\nStands in the third, the saviour’s place,\nTo save—or to consume?\nO whither, ere it be fulfilled,\nEre its fierce blast be hushed and stilled,\nShall blow the wind of doom?\n[Exeunt.]",

She, in after time,\nGave o’er the throne, as birthgift to a god,\nPhoebus, who in his own bears Phoebe’s name.\nHe from the lake and ridge of Delos’ isle\nSteered to the port of Pallas’ Attic shores,\nThe home of ships; and thence he passed and came\nUnto this land and to Parnassus’ shrine.\nAnd at his side, with awe revering him,\nThere went the children of Hephaestus’ seed,\nThe hewers of the sacred way, who tame\nThe stubborn tract that erst was wilderness.\nAnd all this folk, and Delphos, chieftain-king\nOf this their land, with honour gave him home;\nAnd in his breast Zeus set a prophet’s soul,\nAnd gave to him this throne, whereon he sits,\nFourth prophet of the shrine, and, Loxias hight,\nGives voice to that which Zeus his sire decrees.\nSuch gods I name in my preluding prayer,\nAnd after them, I call with honour due\nOn Pallas, wardress of the fane, and Nymphs\nWho dwell around the rock Corycian,\nWhere in the hollow cave, the wild birds’ haunt,\nWander the feet of lesser gods; and there,\nRight well I know it, Bromian Bacchus dwells,\nSince he in godship led his Maenad host,\nDevising death for Pentheus, whom they rent\nPiecemeal, as hare among the hounds. And last,\nI call on Pleistus’ springs, Poseidon’s might,\nAnd Zeus most high, the great Accomplisher.\nThen as a seeress to the sacred chair\nI pass and sit; and may the powers divine\nMake this mine entrance fruitful in response\nBeyond each former advent, triply blest.\nAnd if there stand without, from Hellas bound,\nMen seeking oracles, let each pass in\nIn order of the lot, as use allows;\nFor the god guides whate’er my tongue proclaims.\n[She goes into the interior of the temple; after a short interval, she returns in great fear.\nThings fell to speak of, fell for eyes to see,\nHave sped me forth again from Loxias’ shrine,\nWith strength unstrung, moving erect no more,\nBut aiding with my hands my failing feet,\nUnnerved by fear. A beldame’s force is naught—\nIs as a child’s, when age and fear combine.\nFor as I pace towards the inmost fane\nBay-filleted by many a suppliant’s hand,\nLo, at the central altar I descry\nOne crouching as for refuge—yea, a man\nAbhorredd of heaven; and from his hands, wherein\nA sword new-drawn he holds, blood reeked and fell:\nA wand he bears, the olive’s topmost bough,\nTwined as of purpose with a deep close tuft\nOf whitest wool. This, that I plainly saw,\nPlainly I tell. But lo, in front of him,\nCrouched on the altar-steps, a grisly band\nOf women slumbers—not like women they,\nBut Gorgons rather; nay, that word is weak,\nNor may I match the Gorgons’ shape with theirs!\nSuch have I seen in painted semblance erst—\nWinged Harpies, snatching food from Phineus’ board,—\nBut these are wingless, black, and all their shape\nThe eye’s abomination to behold.\nFell is the breath—let none draw nigh to it—\nWherewith they snort in slumber; from their eyes\nExude the damnèd drops of poisonous ire:\nAnd such their garb as none should dare to bring\nTo statues of the gods or homes of men.\nI wot not of the tribe wherefrom can come\nSo fell a legion, nor in what land Earth\nCould rear, unharmed, such creatures, nor avow\nThat she had travailed and brought forth death.\nBut, for the rest, be all these things a care\nUnto the mighty Loxias, the lord\nOf this our shrine: healer and prophet he,\nDiscerner he of portents, and the cleanser\nOf other homes—behold, his own to cleanse!\n[Exit.\n[The scene opens, disclosing the interior of the temple: Orestes clings to the central altar; the Furies lie slumbering at a little distance; Apollo and Hermes appear from the innermost shrine.\nAPOLLO\nLo, I desert thee never: to the end,\nHard at thy side as now, or sundered far,\nI am thy guard, and to thine enemies\nImplacably oppose me: look on them,\nThese greedy fiends, beneath my craft subdued!\nSee, they are fallen on sleep, these beldames old,\nUnto whose grim and wizened maidenhood\nNor god nor man nor beast can e’er draw near.\nYea, evil were they born, for evil’s doom,\nEvil the dark abyss of Tartarus\nWherein they dwell, and they themselves the hate\nOf men on earth, and of Olympian gods.\nBut thou, flee far and with unfaltering speed;\nFor they shall hunt thee through the mainland wide\nWhere’er throughout the tract of travelled earth\nThy foot may roam, and o’er and o’er the seas\nAnd island homes of men. Faint not nor fail,\nToo soon and timidly within thy breast\nShepherding thoughts forlorn of this thy toil;\nBut unto Pallas’ city go, and there\nCrouch at her shrine, and in thine arms enfold\nHer ancient image: there we well shall find\nMeet judges for this cause and suasive pleas,\nSkilled to contrive for thee deliverance\nFrom all this woe. Be such my pledge to thee,\nFor by my hest thou didst thy mother slay.\nORESTES\nO king Apollo, since right well thou know’st\nWhat justice bids, have heed, fulfil the same,—\nThy strength is all-sufficient to achieve.\nAPOLLO\nHave thou too heed, nor let thy fear prevail\nAbove thy will. And do thou guard him, Hermes,\nWhose blood is brother unto mine, whose sire\nThe same high God. Men call thee guide and guard,\nGuide therefore thou and guard my suppliant;\nFor Zeus himself reveres the outlaw’s right,\nBoon of fair escort, upon man conferred.\n[Exeunt Apollo, Hermes, and Orestes. The Ghost of Clytemnestra near\nGHOST OF CLYTEMNESTRA\nSleep on! awake! what skills your sleep to me—\nMe, among all the dead by you dishonoured—\nMe from whom never, in the world of death,\nDieth this curse, ’Tis she who smote and slew,\nAnd shamed and scorned I roam? Awake, and hear\nMy plaint of dead men’s hate intolerable.\nMe, sternly slain by them that should have loved,\nMe doth no god arouse him to avenge,\nHewn down in blood by matricidal hands.\nMark ye these wounds from which the heart’s blood ran,\nAnd by whose hand, bethink ye! for the sense\nWhen shut in sleep hath then the spirit-sight,\nBut in the day the inward eye is blind.\nList, ye who drank so oft with lapping tongue\nThe wineless draught by me outpoured to soothe\nYour vengeful ire! how oft on kindled shrine\nI laid the feast of darkness, at the hour\nAbhorred of every god but you alone!\nLo, all my service trampled down and scorned!\nAnd he hath baulked your chase, as stag the hounds;\nYea, lightly bounding from the circling toils,\nHath wried his face in scorn, and flieth far.\nAwake and hear—for mine own soul I cry—\nAwake, ye powers of hell! the wandering ghost\nThat once was Clytemnestra calls—Arise!\n[The Furies mutter grimly, as in a dream.\nMutter and murmur! He hath flown afar— My kin have gods to guard them, I have none!\n[The Furies mutter as before.\nO drowsed in sleep too deep to heed my pain!\nOrestes flies, who me, his mother, slew.\n[The Furies give a confused cry.\nYelping, and drowsed again? Up and be doing\nThat which alone is yours, the deed of hell!\n[The Furies give another cry.\nLo, sleep and toil, the sworn confederates,\nHave quelled your dragon-anger, once so fell!\nTHE FURIES (muttering more fiercely and loudly)\nSeize, seize, seize, seize—mark, yonder!\nGHOST\nIn dreams ye chase a prey, and like some hound,\nThat even in sleep doth ply his woodland toil,\nYe bell and bay. What do ye, sleeping here?\nBe not o’ercome with toil, nor sleep-subdued,\nBe heedless of my wrong. Up! thrill your heart\nWith the just chidings of my tongue,—such words\nAre as a spur to purpose firmly held.\nBlow forth on him the breath of wrath and blood,\nScorch him with reek of fire that burns in you,\nWaste him with new pursuit—swift, hound him down!\n[Ghost sinks.\nFIRST FURY (awaking)\nUp! rouse another as I rouse thee; up!\nSleep’st thou? Rise up, and spurning sleep away,\nSee we if false to us this prelude rang.\nCHORUS OF FURIES\nAlack, alack, O sisters, we have toiled,\nO much and vainly have we toiled and borne!\nVainly! and all we wrought the gods have foiled,\nAnd turnèd us to scorn!\nHe hath slipped from the net, whom we chased: he\nhath ’scaped us who should be our prey—\nO’ermastered by slumber we sank, and our quarry hath stolen away!\nThou, child of the high God Zeus, Apollo, hast robbed us and wronged;\nThou, a youth, hast down-trodden the right that is godship more ancient belonged;\nThou hast cherished thy suppliant man; the slayer the God-forsaken,\nThe bane of a parent, by craft from out of our grasp thou hast taken:\nA god, thou hast stolen from us the avengers a matricide son—\nAnd who shall consider thy deed and say, It is rightfully done?\nThe sound of chiding scorn\nCame from the land of dream;\nDeep to mine inmost heart I felt it thrill and burn,\nThrust as a strong-grasped goad, to urge\nOnward the chariot’s team.\nThrilled, chilled with bitter inward pain\nI stand as one beneath the doomsman’s scourge.\nShame on the younger gods who tread down right,\nSitting on thrones of might!\nWoe on the altar of earth’s central fane!\nClotted on step and shrine,\nBehold, the guilt of blood, the ghastly stain!\nWoe upon thee, Apollo! uncontrolled,\nUnbidden, hast thou, prophet-god, imbrued\nThe pure prophetic shrine with wrongful blood!\nFor thou too heinous a respect didst hold\nOf man, too little heed of powers divine!\nAnd us the Fates, the ancients of the earth,\nDidst deem as nothing worth.\nScornful to me thou art, yet shalt not fend\nMy wrath from him; though unto hell he flee,\nThere too are we!\nAnd he the blood defiled, should feel and rue,\nThough I were not, fiend-wrath that shall not end,\nDescending on his head who foully slew.\n[Re-enter Apollo from the inner shrine.\nAPOLLO\nOut! I command you. Out from this my home—\nHaste, tarry not! Out from the mystic shrine,\nLest thy lot be to take into thy breast\nThe winged bright dart that from my golden string\nSpeeds hissing as a snake,—lest, pierced and thrilled\nWith agony, thou shouldst spew forth again\nBlack frothy heart’s-blood, drawn from mortal men,\nBelching the gory clots sucked forth from wounds.\nThese be no halls where such as you can prowl—\nGo where men lay on men the doom of blood,\nHeads lopped from necks, eyes from their spheres plucked out,\nHacked flesh, the flower of youthful seed crushed out,\nFeet hewn away, and hands, and death beneath\nThe smiting stone, low moans and piteous\nOf men impaled—Hark, hear ye for what feast\nYe hanker ever, and the loathing gods\nDo spit upon your craving? Lo, your shape\nIs all too fitted to your greed; the cave\nWhere lurks some lion, lapping gore, were home\nMore meet for you. Avaunt from sacred shrines,\nNor bring pollution by your touch on all\nThat nears you. Hence! and roam unshepherded—\nNo god there is to tend such herd as you.\nCHORUS\nO king Apollo, in our turn hear us.\nThou hast’not only part in these ill things,\nBut art chief cause and doer of the same.\nAPOLLO\nHow? stretch thy speech to tell this, and have done.\nCHORUS\nThine oracle bade this man slay his mother.\nAPOLLO\nI bade him quit his sire’s death,—wherefore not?\nCHORUS\nThen didst thou aid and guard red-handed crime.\nAPOLLO\nYea, and I bade him to this temple flee.\nCHORUS\nAnd yet forsooth dost chide us following him!\nAPOLLO\nAy—not for you it is, to near this fane.\nCHORUS\nYet is such office ours, imposed by fate.\nAPOLLO\nWhat office? vaunt the thing ye deem so fair.\nCHORUS\nFrom home to home we chase the matricide.\nAPOLLO\nWhat? to avenge a wife who slays her lord?\nCHORUS\nThat is not blood outpoured by kindred hands.\nAPOLLO\nHow darkly ye dishonour and annul\nThe troth to which the high accomplishers,\nHera and Zeus, do honour. Yea, and thus\nIs Aphrodite to dishonour cast,\nThe queen of rapture unto mortal men.\nKnow, that above the marriage-bed ordained\nFor man and woman standeth Right as guard,\nEnhancing sanctity of troth-plight sworn;\nTherefore, if thou art placable to those\nWho have their consort slain, nor will’st to turn\nOn them the eye of wrath, unjust art thou\nIn hounding to his doom the man who slew\nHis mother. Lo, I know thee full of wrath\nAgainst one deed, but all too placable\nUnto the other, minishing the crime.\nBut in this cause shall Pallas guard the right.\nCHORUS\nDeem not my quest shall ever quit that man.\nAPOLLO\nFollow then, make thee double toil in vain!\nCHORUS\nThink not by speech mine office to curtail.\nAPOLLO\nNone hast thou, that I would accept of thee!\nCHORUS\nYea, high thine honour by the throne of Zeus:\nBut I, drawn on by scent of mother’s blood,\nSeek vengeance on this man and hound him down.\nAPOLLO\nBut I will stand beside him; ’tis for me\nTo guard my suppliant: gods and men alike\nDo dread the curse of such an one betrayed,\nAnd in me Fear and Will say Leave him not.\n[Exeunt omnes]",

    "content":"The scene changes to Athens. In the foreground, the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis; her statue stands in the centre; Orestes is seen clinging to it.\nORESTES\nLook on me, queen Athena; lo, I come\nBy Loxias’ behest; thou of thy grace\nReceive me, driven of avenging powers—\nNot now a red-hand slayer unannealed,\nBut with guilt fading, half-effaced, outworn\nOn many homes and paths of mortal men.\nFor to the limit of each land, each sea,\nI roamed, obedient to Apollo’s hest,\nAnd come at last, O Goddess, to thy fane,\nAnd clinging to thine image, bide my doom.\n[Enter the Chorus of Furies, questing like hounds\nCHORUS\nHo! clear is here the trace of him we seek:\nFollow the track of blood, the silent sign!\nLike to some hound that hunts a wounded fawn,\nWe snuff along the scent of dripping gore,\nAnd inwardly we pant, for many a day\nToiling in chase that shall fordo the man;\nFor o’er and o’er the wide land have I ranged,\nAnd o’er the wide sea, flying without wings,\nSwift as a sail I pressed upon his track,\nWho now hard by is crouching, well I wot,\nFor scent of mortal blood allures me here.\nFollow, seek him—round and round\nScent and snuff and scan the ground,\nLest unharmed he slip away,\nHe who did his mother slay!\nHist—he is there! See him his arms entwine\nAround the image of the maid divine—\nThus aided, for the deed he wrought\nUnto the judgment wills he to be brought.\nIt may not be! a mother’s blood, poured forth\nUpon the stainèd earth,\nNone gathers up: it lies—bear witness, Hell!—\nFor aye indelible!\nAnd thou who sheddest it shalt give thine own\nThat shedding to atone!\nYea, from thy living limbs I suck it out,\nRed, clotted, gout by gout,—\nA draught abhorred of men and gods; but I\nWill drain it, suck thee dry;\nYea, I will waste thee living, nerve and vein;\nYea, for thy mother slain,\nWill drag thee downward, there where thou shalt dree\nThe weird of agony!\nAnd thou and whatsoe’er of men hath sinned—\nHath wronged or God, or friend,\nOr parent,—learn ye how to all and each\nThe arm of doom can reach!\nSternly requiteth, in the world beneath,\nThe judgment-seat of Death;\nYea, Death, beholding every man’s endeavour\nRecordeth it for ever.\nORESTES\nI, schooled in many miseries, have learnt\nHow many refuges of cleansing shrines\nThere be; I know when law alloweth speech\nAnd when imposeth silence. Lo, I stand\nFixed now to speak, for he whose word is wise\nCommands the same. Look, how the stain of blood\nIs dull upon mine hand and wastes away,\nAnd laved and lost therewith is the deep curse\nOf matricide; for while the guilt was new,\n’Twas banished from me at Apollo’s hearth,\nAtoned and purified by death of swine.\nLong were my word if I should sum the tale,\nHow oft since then among my fellow-men\nI stood and brought no curse. Time cleanses all—\nTime, the coeval of all things that are.\nNow from pure lips, in words of omen fair,\nI call Athena, lady of this land,\nTo come, my champion: so, in aftertime,\nShe shall not fail of love and service leal,\nNot won by war, from me and from my land,\nAnd all the folk of Argos, vowed to her.\nNow, be she far away in Libyan land\nWhere flows from Triton’s lake her natal wave,—\nStand she with planted feet, or in some hour\nOf rest conceal them, champion of her friends\nWhere’er she be,—or whether o’er the plain\nPhlegraean she look forth, as warrior bold—\nI cry to her to come, where’er she be,\n(And she, as goddess, from afar can hear,)\nAnd aid and free me, set among my foes.\nCHORUS\nThee not Apollo nor Athena’s strength\nCan save from perishing, a castaway\nAmid the Lost, where no delight shall meet\nThy soul—a bloodless prey of nether powers,\nA shadow among shadows. Answerest thou\nNothing? dost cast away my words with scorn,\nThou, prey prepared and dedicate to me?\nNot as a victim slain upon the shrine,\nBut living shalt thou see thy flesh my food.\nHear now the binding chant that makes thee mine.\nWeave the weird dance,—behold the hour\nTo utter forth the chant of hell,\nOur sway among mankind to tell,\nThe guidance of our power.\nOf Justice are we ministers,\nAnd whosoe’er of men may stand\nLifting a pure unsullied hand,\nThat man no doom of ours incurs,\nAnd walks thro’ all his mortal path\nUntouched by woe, unharmed by wrath.\nBut if, as yonder man, he hath\nBlood on the hands he strives to hide,\nWe stand avengers at his side,\nDecreeing, Thou hast wronged the dead:\nWe are doom’s witnesses to thee.\nThe price of blood, his hands have shed,\nWe wring from him; in life, in death,\nHard at his side are we!\nNight, Mother Night, who brought me forth, a torment\nTo living men and dead,\nHear me, O hear! by Leto’s stripling son\nI am dishonourèd:\nHe hath ta’en from me him who cowers in refuge,\nTo me made consecrate,—\nA rightful victim, him who slew his mother.\nGiven o’er to me and fate.\nHear the hymn of hell,\nO’er the victim sounding,—\nChant of frenzy, chant of ill,\nSense and will confounding!\nRound the soul entwining\nWithout lute or lyre—\nSoul in madness pining,\nWasting as with fire!\nFate, all-pervading Fate, this service spun, commanding\nThat I should bide therein:\nWhosoe’er of mortals, made perverse and lawless,\nIs stained with blood of kin,\nBy his side are we, and hunt him ever onward,\nTill to the Silent Land,\nThe realm of death, he cometh; neither yonder\nIn freedom shall he stand.\nHear the hymn of hell,\nO’er the victim sounding,—\nChant of frenzy, chant of ill,\nSense and will confounding!\nRound the soul entwining\nWithout lute or lyre—\nSoul in madness pining,\nWasting as with fire!\nWhen from womb of Night we sprang, on us this labour\nWas laid and shall abide.\nGods immortal are ye, yet beware ye touch not\nThat which is our pride!\nNone may come beside us gathered round the blood feast—\nFor us no garments white\nGleam on a festal day; for us a darker fate is,\nAnother darker rite.\nThat is mine hour when falls an ancient line—\nWhen in the household’s heart\nThe god of blood doth slay by kindred hands,—\nThen do we bear our part:\nOn him who slays we sweep with chasing cry:\nThough he be triply strong,\nWe wear and waste him; blood atones for blood,\nNew pain for ancient wrong.\nI hold this task—’tis mine, and not another’s.\nThe very gods on high,\nThough they can silence and annul the prayers\nOf those who on us cry,\nThey may not strive with us who stand apart,\nA race by Zeus abhorred,\nBlood-boltered, held unworthy of the council\nAnd converse of Heaven’s lord.\nTherefore the more I leap upon my prey;\nUpon their head I bound;\nMy foot is hard; as one that trips a runner\nI cast them to the ground;\nYea, to the depth of doom intolerable;\nAnd they who erst were great,\nAnd upon earth held high their pride and glory,\nAre brought to low estate.\nIn underworld they waste and are diminished,\nThe while around them fleet\nDark wavings of my robes, and, subtly woven,\nThe paces of my feet.\nWho falls infatuate, he sees not, neither knows he\nThat we are at his side;\nSo closely round about him, darkly flitting,\nThe cloud of guilt doth glide.\nHeavily ’tis uttered, how around his hearthstone\nThe mirk of hell doth rise.\nStern and fixed the law is; we have hands t’achieve it,\nCunning to devise.\nQueens are we and mindful of our solemn vengeance.\nNot by tear or prayer\nShall a man avert it. In unhonoured darkness,\nFar from gods, we fare,\nLit unto our task with torch of sunless regions,\nAnd o’er a deadly way—\nDeadly to the living as to those who see not\nLife and light of day—\nHunt we and press onward. Who of mortals hearing\nDoth not quake for awe,\nHearing all that Fate thro’ hand of God hath given us\nFor ordinance and law?\nYea, this right to us, in dark abysm and backward\nOf ages it befel:\nNone shall wrong mine office, tho’ in nether regions\nAnd sunless dark I dwell.\n[Enter Athena from above.\nATHENA\nFar off I heard the clamour of your cry,\nAs by Scamander’s side I set my foot\nAsserting right upon the land given o’er\nTo me by those who o’er Achaia’s host\nHeld sway and leadership: no scanty part\nOf all they won by spear and sword, to me\nThey gave it, land and all that grew theron,\nAs chosen heirloom for my Theseus’ clan.\nThence summoned, sped I with a tireless foot,—\nHummed on the wind, instead of wings, the fold\nOf this mine aegis, by my feet propelled,\nAs, linked to mettled horses, speeds a car.\nAnd now, beholding here Earth’s nether brood,\nI fear it nought, yet are mine eyes amazed\nWith wonder. Who are ye? of all I ask,\nAnd of this stranger to my statue clinging.\nBut ye—your shape is like no human form,\nLike to no goddess whom the gods behold,\nLike to no shape which mortal women wear.\nYet to stand by and chide a monstrous form\nIs all unjust—from such words Right revolts.\nCHORUS\nO child of Zeus, one word shall tell thee all.\nWe are the children of eternal Night,\nAnd Furies in the underworld are called.\nATHENA\nI know your lineage now and eke your name.\nCHORUS\nYea, and eftsoons indeed my rights shalt know.\nATHENA\nFain would I learn them; speak them clearly forth.\nCHORUS\nWe chase from home the murderers of men.\nATHENA\nAnd where at last can he that slew make pause?\nCHORUS\nWhere this is law—All joy abandon here.\nATHENA\nSay, do ye bay this man to such a flight?\nCHORUS\nYea, for of choice he did his mother slay.\nATHENA\nUrged by no fear of other wrath and doom?\nCHORUS\nWhat spur can rightly goad to matricide?\nATHENA\nTwo stand to plead—one only have I heard.\nCHORUS\nHe will not swear nor challenge us to oath.\nATHENA\nThe form of justice, not its deed, thou willest.\nCHORUS\nProve thou that word; thou art not scant of skill.\nATHENA\nI say that oaths shall not enforce the wrong.\nCHORUS\nThen test the cause, judge and award the right.\nATHENA\nWill ye to me then this decision trust?\nCHORUS\nYea, reverencing true child of worthy sire.\nATHENA (to Orestes)\nO man unknown, make thou thy plea in turn.\nSpeak forth thy land, thy lineage, and thy woes;\nThen, if thou canst, avert this bitter blame—\nIf, as I deem, in confidence of right\nThou sittest hard beside my holy place,\nClasping this statue, as Ixion sat,\nA sacred suppliant for Zeus to cleanse,—\nTo all this answer me in words made plain.\nORESTES\nO queen Athena, first from thy last words\nWill I a great solicitude remove.\nNot one blood-guilty am I; no foul stain\nClings to thine image from my clinging hand;\nWhereof one potent proof I have to tell.\nLo, the law stands—The slayer shall not plead,\nTill by the hand of him who cleanses blood\nA suckling creature’s blood besprinkle him.\nLong since have I this expiation done,—\nIn many a home, slain beasts and running streams\nHave cleansed me.

    "content":"THE PERSIANS\nARGUMENT\nXerxes, son of Darius and of his wife Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, went forth against Hellas, to take vengeance upon those who had defeated his father at Marathon. But ill fortune befell the king and his army both by land and sea; neither did it avail him that he cast a bridge over the Hellespont and made a canal across the promontory of Mount Athos, and brought myriads of men, by land and sea, to subdue the Greeks. For in the strait between Athens and the island of Salamis the Persian ships were shattered and sunk or put to flight by those of Athens and Lacedaemon and Aegina and Corinth, and Xerxes went homewards on the way by which he had come, leaving his general Mardonius with three hundred thousand men to strive with the Greeks by land: but in the next year they were destroyed near Plataea in Boeotia, by the Lacedaemonians and Athenians and Tegeans. Such was the end of the army which Xerxes left behind him. But the king himself had reached the bridge over the Hellespont, and late and hardly and in sorry plight and with few companions came home unto the Palace of Susa.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nCHORUS OF PERSIAN ELDERS.\nATOSSA, WIDOW OF DARIUS AND MOTHER OF XERXES.\nA MESSENGER.\nTHE GHOST OF DARIUS.\nXERXES.\nThe Scene is laid at the Palace of Susa.\nCHORUS.\nAway unto the Grecian land\nHath passed the Persian armament:\nWe, by the monarch’s high command,\nWe are the warders true who stand,\nChosen, for honour and descent,\nTo watch the wealth of him who went—\nGuards of the gold, and faithful styled\nBy Xerxes, great Darius’ child!\nBut the king went nor comes again—\nAnd for that host, we saw depart\nArrayed in gold, my boding heart\nAches with a pulse of anxious pain,\nPresageful for its youthful king!\nNo scout, no steed, no battle-car\nComes speeding hitherward, to bring\nNews to our city from afar!\nErewhile they went, away, away,\nFrom Susa, from Ecbatana,\nFrom Kissa’s timeworn fortress grey,\nPassing to ravage and to war—\nSome upon steeds, on galleys some,\nSome in close files, they passed from home,\nAll upon warlike errand bent—\nAmistres, Artaphernes went,\nAstaspes, Megabazes high,\nLords of the Persian chivalry,\nMarshals who serve the great king’s word\nChieftains of all the mighty horde!\nHorsemen and bowmen streamed away,\nGrim in their aspect, fixed to slay,\nAnd resolute to face the fray!\nWith troops of horse, careering fast,\nMasistes, Artembáres passed:\nImaeus too, the bowman brave,\nSosthánes, Pharandákes, drave—\nAnd others the all-nursing wave\nOf Nilus to the battle gave;\nCame Susiskánes, warrior wild,\nAnd Pegastágon, Egypt’s child:\nThee, brave Arsámes! from afar\nDid holy Memphis launch to war;\nAnd Ariomardus, high in fame,\nFrom Thebes the immemorial came,\nAnd oarsmen skilled from Nilus’ fen,\nA countless crowd of warlike men:\nAnd next, the dainty Lydians went—\nSoft rulers of a continent—\nMitragathes and Arcteus bold\nIn twin command their ranks controlled,\nAnd Sardis town, that teems with gold,\nSent forth its squadrons to the war—\nHorse upon horse, and car on car,\nDouble and triple teams, they rolled,\nIn onset awful to behold.\nFrom Tmolus’ sacred hill there came\nThe native hordes to join the fray,\nAnd upon Hellas’ neck to lay\nThe yoke of slavery and shame;\nMardon and Tharubis were there,\nBright anvils for the foemen’s spear!\nThe Mysian dart-men sped to war,\nAnd the long crowd that onward rolled\nFrom Babylon enriched with gold—\nCaptains of ships and archers skilled\nTo speed the shaft, and those who wield\nThe scimitar;—the eastern band\nWho, by the great king’s high command,\nSwept to subdue the western land!\nGone are they, gone—ah, welladay!\nThe flower and pride of our array;\nAnd all the Eastland, from whose breast\nCame forth her bravest and her best,\nCraves longingly with boding dread—\nParents for sons, and brides new-wed\nFor absent lords, and, day by day,\nShudder with dread at their delay!\nEre now they have passed o’er the sea, the manifold host of the king—\nThey have gone forth to sack and to burn; ashore on the Westland they spring!\nWith cordage and rope they have bridged the sea-way of Helle, to pass\nO’er the strait that is named by thy name, O daughter of Athamas!\nThey have anchored their ships in the current, they have bridled the neck of the sea—\nThe Shepherd and Lord of the East hath bidden a roadway to be!\nFrom the land to the land they pass over, a herd at the high king’s best;\nSome by the way of the waves, and some o’er the planking have pressed.\nFor the king is a lord and a god: he was born of the golden seed\nThat erst upon Danae fell—his captains are strong at the need!\nAnd dark is the glare of his eyes, as eyes of a serpent blood-fed,\nAnd with manifold troops in his train and with manifold ships hath he sped—\nYea, sped with his Syrian cars: he leads on the lords of the bow\nTo meet with the men of the West, the spear-armed force of the foe!\nCan any make head and resist him, when he comes with the roll of a wave?\nNo barrier nor phalanx of might, no chief, be he ever so brave!\nFor stern is the onset of Persia, and gallant her children in fight.\nBut the guile of the god is deceitful, and who shall elude him by flight?\nAnd who is the lord of the leap, that can spring and alight and evade?\nFor Até deludes and allures, till round him the meshes are laid,\nAnd no man his doom can escape! it was writ in the rule of high Heaven,\nThat in tramp of the steeds and in crash of the charge the war-cry of Persia be given:\nThey have learned to behold the forbidden, the sacred enclosure of sea,\nWhere the waters are wide and in stress of the wind the billows roll hoary to lee!\nAnd their trust is in cable and cordage, too weak in the power of the blast,\nAnd frail are the links of the bridge whereby unto Hellas they passed.\nTherefore my gloom-wrapped heart is rent with sorrow\nFor what may hap to-morrow!\nAlack, for all the Persian armament—\nAlack, lest there be sent\nDread news of desolation, Susa’s land\nBereft, forlorn, unmanned—\nLest the grey Kissian fortress echo back\nThe wail, Alack, Alack!\nThe sound of women’s shriek, who wail and mourn,\nWith fine-spun raiment torn!\nThe charioteers went forth nor come again,\nAnd all the marching men\nEven as a swarm of bees have flown afar,\nDrawn by the king to war—\nCrossing the sea-bridge, linked from side to side,\nThat doth the waves divide:\nAnd the soft bridal couch of bygone years\nIs now bedewed with tears,\nEach princess, clad in garments delicate,\nWails for her widowed fate—\nAlas my gallant bridegroom, lost and gone,\nAnd I am left alone!\nBut now, ye warders of the state,\nHere, in this hall of old renown,\nBehoves that we deliberate\nIn counsel deep and wise debate,\nFor need is surely shown!\nHow fareth he, Darius’ child,\nThe Persian king, from Perseus styled?\nComes triumph to the eastern bow,\nOr hath the lance-point conquered now?\nEnter ATOSSA.\nSee, yonder comes the mother-queen,\nLight of our eyes, in godlike sheen,\nThe royal mother of the king!—\nFall we before her! well it were\nThat, all as one, we sue to her,\nAnd round her footsteps cling!\nQueen, among deep-girded Persian dames thou highest and most royal,\nHoary mother, thou, of Xerxes, and Darius’ wife of old!\nTo godlike sire, and godlike son, we bow us and are loyal—\nUnless, on us, an adverse tide of destiny has rolled!\nATOSSA.\nTherefore come I forth to you, from chambers decked and golden,\nWhere long ago Darius laid his head, with me beside,\nAnd my heart is torn with anguish, and with terror am I holden,\nAnd I plead unto your friendship and I bid you to my side.\nDarius, in the old time, by aid of some Immortal,\nRaised up the stately fabric, our wealth of long-ago:\nBut I tremble lest it totter down, and ruin porch and portal,\nAnd the whirling dust of downfall rise above its overthrow!\nTherefore a dread unspeakable within me never slumbers,\nSaying, Honour not the gauds of wealth if men have ceased to grow,\nNor deem that men, apart from wealth, can find their strength in numbers—\nWe shudder for our light and king, though we have gold enow!\nNo light there is, in any house, save presence of the master—\nSo runs the saw, ye aged men! and truth it says indeed—\nOn you I call, the wise and true, to ward us from disaster,\nFor all my hope is fixed on you, to prop us in our need!\nCHORUS.\nQueen-Mother of the Persian land, to thy commandment bowing,\nWhate’er thou wilt, in word or deed, we follow to fulfil—\nNot twice we need thine high behest, our faith and duty knowing,\nIn council and in act alike, thy loyal servants still!\nATOSSA.\nLong while by various visions of the night\nAm I beset, since to Ionian lands\nWith marshalled host my son went forth to war.\nYet never saw I presage so distinct\nAs in the night now passed.—Attend my tale!—\nA dream I had: two women nobly clad\nCame to my sight, one robed in Persian dress,\nThe other vested in the Dorian garb,\nAnd both right stately and more tall by far\nThan women of to-day, and beautiful\nBeyond disparagement, and sisters sprung\nBoth of one race, but, by their natal lot,\nOne born in Hellas, one in Eastern land.\nThese, as it seemed unto my watching eyes,\nRoused each the other to a mutual feud:\nThe which my son perceiving set himself\nTo check and soothe their struggle, and anon\nYoked them and set the collars on their necks;\nAnd one, the Ionian, proud in this array,\nPaced in high quietude, and lent her mouth,\nObedient, to the guidance of the rein.\nBut restively the other strove, and broke\nThe fittings of the car, and plunged away\nWith mouth un-bitted: o’er the broken yoke\nMy son was hurled, and lo! Darius stood\nIn lamentation o’er his fallen child.\nHim Xerxes saw, and rent his robe in grief.\nSuch was my vision of the night now past;\nBut when, arising, I had dipped my hand\nIn the fair lustral stream, I drew towards\nThe altar, in the act of sacrifice,\nHaving in mind to offer, as their due,\nThe sacred meal-cake to the averting powers,\nLords of the rite that banisheth ill dreams.\nWhen lo! I saw an eagle fleeing fast\nTo Phoebus’ shrine—O friends, I stayed my steps,\nToo scared to speak! for, close upon his flight,\nA little falcon dashed in winged pursuit,\nPlucking with claws the eagle’s head, while he\nCould only crouch and cower and yield himself.\nScared was I by that sight, and eke to you\nNo less a terror must it be to hear!\nFor mark this well—if Xerxes have prevailed,\nHe shall come back the wonder of the world:\nIf not, still none can call him to account—\nSo he but live, he liveth Persia’s King!\nCHORUS.\nQueen, it stands not with my purpose to abet these fears of thine,\nNor to speak with glazing comfort! nay, betake thee to the shrine!\nIf thy dream foretold disaster, sue to gods to bar its way,\nAnd, for thyself, son, state, and friends, to bring fair fate to-day.\nNext, unto Earth and to the Dead be due libation poured,\nAnd by thee let Darius’ soul be wistfully implored—\nI saw thee, lord, in last night’s dream, a phantom from the grave,\nI pray thee, lord, from earth beneath come forth to help and save!\nTo me and to thy son send up the bliss of triumph now,\nAnd hold the gloomy fates of ill, dim in the dark below!\nSuch be thy words! my inner heart good tidings doth foretell,\nAnd that fair fate will spring thereof, if wisdom guide us well.\nATOSSA.\nLoyal thou that first hast read this dream, this vision of the night,\nWith loyalty to me, the queen—be then thy presage right!\nAnd therefore, as thy bidding is, what time I pass within\nTo dedicate these offerings, new prayers I will begin,\nAlike to gods and the great dead who loved our lineage well.\nYet one more word—say, in what realm do the Athenians dwell?\nCHORUS.\nFar hence, even where, in evening land, goes down our Lord the Sun.\nATOSSA.\nSay, had my son so keen desire, that region to o’errun?\nCHORUS.\nYea—if she fell, the rest of Greece were subject to our sway!\nATOSSA.\nHath she so great predominance, such legions in array?\nCHORUS.\nAy—such a host as smote us sore upon an earlier day.\nATOSSA.\nAnd what hath she, besides her men? enow of wealth in store?\nCHORUS.\nA mine of treasure in the earth, a fount of silver ore!\nATOSSA.\nIs it in skill of bow and shaft that Athens’ men excel?\nCHORUS.\nNay, they bear bucklers in the fight, and thrust the spear-point well.\nATOSSA.\nAnd who is shepherd of their host and holds them in command?\nCHORUS.\nTo no man do they bow as slaves, nor own a master’s hand.\nATOSSA.\nHow should they bide our brunt of war, the East upon the West?\nCHORUS.\nThat could Darius’ valiant horde in days of yore attest!\nATOSSA.\nA boding word, to us who bore the men now far away!\nCHORUS.\nNay—as I deem, the very truth will dawn on us to-day.\nA Persian by his garb and speed, a courier draws anear—\nHe bringeth news, of good or ill, for Persia’s land to hear.\nEnter a MESSENGER.\nMESSENGER.\nO walls and towers of all the Asian realm,\nO Persian land, O treasure-house of gold!\nHow, by one stroke, down to destruction, down,\nHath sunk our pride, and all the flower of war\nThat once was Persia’s, lieth in the dust!\nWoe on the man who first announceth woe—\nYet must I all the tale of death unroll!\nHark to me, Persians! Persia’s host lies low.\nCHORUS.\nO ruin manifold, and woe, and fear!\nLet the wild tears run down, for the great doom is here!\nMESSENGER.\nThis blow hath fallen, to the utterance, And I, past hope, behold my safe return!\nCHORUS.\nToo long, alack, too long this life of mine,\nThat in mine age I see this sudden woe condign!\nMESSENGER.\nAs one who saw, by no loose rumour led,\nLords, I would tell what doom was dealt to us.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, how vainly have they striven!\nOur myriad hordes with shaft and bow\nWent from the Eastland, to lay low\nHellas, beloved of Heaven!\nMESSENGER.\nPiled with men dead, yea, miserably slain,\nIs every beach, each reef of Salamis!\nCHORUS.\nThou sayest sooth—ah well-a-day!\nBattered amid the waves, and torn,\nOn surges hither, thither, borne,\nDead bodies, bloodstained and forlorn,\nIn their long cloaks they toss and stray!\nMESSENGER.\nTheir bows availed not! all have perished, all,\nBy charging galleys crushed and whelmed in death.\nCHORUS.\nShriek out your sorrow’s wistful wail!\nTo their untimely doom they went;\nIll strove they, and to no avail,\nAnd minished is their armament!\nMESSENGER.\nOut on thee, hateful name of Salamis,\nOut upon Athens, mournful memory!\nCHORUS.\nWoe upon this day’s evil fame!\nThou, Athens, art our murderess;\nAlack, full many a Persian dame\nIs left forlorn and husbandless!\nATOSSA.\nMute have I been awhile, and overwrought\nAt this great sorrow, for it passeth speech,\nAnd passeth all desire to ask of it.\nYet if the gods send evils, men must bear.\n(To the MESSENGER)\nUnroll the record! stand composed and tell,\nAlthough thy heart be groaning inwardly,\nWho hath escaped, and, of our leaders, whom\nHave we to weep? what chieftains in the van\nStood, sank, and died and left us leaderless?\nMESSENGER.\nXerxes himself survives and sees the day.\nATOSSA.\nThen to my line thy word renews the dawn\nAnd golden dayspring after gloom of night!\nMESSENGER.\nBut the brave marshal of ten thousand horse,\nArtembares, is tossed and flung in death\nAlong the rugged rocks Silenian.\nAnd Dadaces no longer leads his troop,\nBut, smitten by the spear, from off the prow\nHath lightly leaped to death; and Tenagon,\nIn true descent a Bactrian nobly born,\nDrifts by the sea-lashed reefs of Salamis,\nThe isle of Ajax. Gone Lilaeus too,\nGone are Arsames and Argestes! all,\nAround the islet where the sea-doves breed,\nDashed their defeated heads on iron rocks;\nArcteus, who dwelt beside the founts of Nile,\nAdeues, Pheresseues, and with them\nPharnuchus, from one galley’s deck went down.\nMatallus, too, of Chrysa, lord and king\nOf myriad hordes, who led unto the fight\nThree times ten thousand swarthy cavaliers,\nFell, with his swarthy and abundant beard\nIncarnadined to red, a crimson stain\nOutrivalling the purple of the sea!\nThere Magian Arabus and Artames\nOf Bactra perished—taking up, alike,\nIn yonder stony land their long sojourn.\nAmistris too, and he whose strenuous spear\nWas foremost in the fight, Amphistreus fell,\nAnd gallant Ariomardus, by whose death\nBroods sorrow upon Sardis: Mysia mourns\nFor Seisames, and Tharubis lies low—\nCommander, he, of five times fifty ships,\nBorn in Lyrnessus: his heroic form\nIs low in death, ungraced with sepulchre.\nDead too is he, the lord of courage high,\nCilicia’s marshal, brave Syennesis,\nThan whom none dealt more carnage on the foe,\nNor perished by a more heroic end.\nSo fell the brave: so speak I of their doom,\nSumming in brief the fate of myriads!\nATOSSA.\nAh well-a-day! these crowning woes I hear,\nThe shame of Persia and her shrieks of dole!\nBut yet renew the tale, repeat thy words,\nTell o’er the count of those Hellenic ships,\nAnd how they ventured with their beakèd prows\nTo charge upon the Persian armament.\nMESSENGER.\nKnow, if mere count of ships could win the day,\nThe Persians had prevailed. The Greeks, in sooth,\nHad but three hundred galleys at the most,\nAnd other ten, select and separate.\nBut—I am witness—Xerxes held command\nOf full a thousand keels, and, those apart,\nTwo hundred more, and seven, for speed renowned!—\nSo stands the reckoning, and who shall dare\nTo say we Persians had the lesser host?\nATOSSA.\nNay, we were worsted by an unseen power\nWho swayed the balance downward to our doom!\nMESSENGER.\nIn ward of heaven doth Pallas’ city stand.\nATOSSA.\nHow then? is Athens yet inviolate?\nMESSENGER.\nWhile her men live, her bulwark standeth firm!\nATOSSA.\nSay, how began the struggle of the ships?\nWho first joined issue? did the Greeks attack,\nOr Xerxes, in his numbers confident?\nMESSENGER.\nO queen, our whole disaster thus befell,\nThrough intervention of some fiend or fate—\nI know not what—that had ill will to us.\nFrom the Athenian host some Greek came o’er,\nTo thy son Xerxes whispering this tale—\nOnce let the gloom of night have gathered in,\nThe Greeks will tarry not, but swiftly spring\nEach to his galley-bench, in furtive flight,\nSoftly contriving safety for their life.\nThy son believed the word and missed the craft\nOf that Greek foeman, and the spite of Heaven,\nAnd straight to all his captains gave this charge—\nAs soon as sunlight warms the ground no more,\nAnd gloom enwraps the sanctuary of sky,\nRange we our fleet in triple serried lines\nTo bar the passage from the seething strait,\nThis way and that: let other ships surround\nThe isle of Ajax, with this warning word—\nThat if the Greeks their jeopardy should scape\nBy wary craft, and win their ships a road.\nEach Persian captain shall his failure pay\nBy forfeit of his head. So spake the king,\nInspired at heart with over-confidence,\nUnwitting of the gods’ predestined will.\nThereon our crews, with no disordered haste,\nDid service to his bidding and purveyed\nThe meal of afternoon: each rower then\nOver the fitted rowlock looped his oar.\nThen, when the splendour of the sun had set,\nAnd night drew on, each master of the oar\nAnd each armed warrior straightway went aboard.\nForward the long ships moved, rank cheering rank,\nEach forward set upon its ordered course.\nAnd all night long the captains of the fleet\nKept their crews moving up and down the strait.\nSo the night waned, and not one Grecian ship\nMade effort to elude and slip away.\nBut as dawn came and with her coursers white\nShone in fair radiance over all the earth,\nFirst from the Grecian fleet rang out a cry,\nA song of onset! and the island crags\nRe-echoed to the shrill exulting sound.\nThen on us Eastern men amazement fell\nAnd fear in place of hope; for what we heard\nWas not a call to flight! the Greeks rang out\nTheir holy, resolute, exulting chant,\nLike men come forth to dare and do and die\nTheir trumpets pealed, and fire was in that sound,\nAnd with the dash of simultaneous oars\nReplying to the war-chant, on they came,\nSmiting the swirling brine, and in a trice\nThey flashed upon the vision of the foe!\nThe right wing first in orderly advance\nCame on, a steady column; following then,\nThe rest of their array moved out and on,\nAnd to our ears there came a burst of sound,\nA clamour manifold.—On, sons of Greece!\nOn, for your country’s freedom! strike to save\nWives, children, temples of ancestral gods,\nGraves of your fathers! now is all at stake.\nThen from our side swelled up the mingled din\nOf Persian tongues, and time brooked no delay—\nShip into ship drave hard its brazen beak\nWith speed of thought, a shattering blow! and first\nOne Grecian bark plunged straight, and sheared away\nBowsprit and stem of a Phoenician ship.\nAnd then each galley on some other’s prow\nCame crashing in. Awhile our stream of ships\nHeld onward, till within the narrowing creek\nOur jostling vessels were together driven,\nAnd none could aid another: each on each\nDrave hard their brazen beaks, or brake away\nThe oar-banks of each other, stem to stern,\nWhile the Greek galleys, with no lack of skill,\nHemmed them and battered in their sides, and soon\nThe hulls rolled over, and the sea was hid,\nCrowded with wrecks and butchery of men.\nNo beach nor reef but was with corpses strewn,\nAnd every keel of our barbarian host\nHurried to flee, in utter disarray.\nThereon the foe closed in upon the wrecks\nAnd hacked and hewed, with oars and splintered planks,\nAs fishermen hack tunnies or a cast\nOf netted dolphins, and the briny sea\nRang with the screams and shrieks of dying men,\nUntil the night’s dark aspect hid the scene.\nHad I a ten days’ time to sum that count\nOf carnage, ’twere too little! know this well—\nOne day ne’er saw such myriad forms of death!\nATOSSA.\nWoe on us, woe! disaster’s mighty sea\nHath burst on us and all the Persian realm!\nMESSENGER.\nBe well assured, the tale is but begun—\nThe further agony that on us fell\nDoth twice outweigh the sufferings I have told!\nATOSSA.\nNay, what disaster could be worse than this?\nSay on! what woe upon the army came,\nSwaying the scale to a yet further fall?\nMESSENGER.\nThe very flower and crown of Persia’s race,\nGallant of soul and glorious in descent,\nAnd highest held in trust before the king,\nLies shamefully and miserably slain.\nATOSSA.\nAlas for me and for this ruin, friends!\nDead, sayest thou? by what fate overthrown?\nMESSENGER.\nAn islet is there, fronting Salamis—\nStrait, and with evil anchorage: thereon\nPan treads the measure of the dance he loves\nAlong the sea-beach. Thither the king sent\nHis noblest, that, whene’er the Grecian foe\nShould ’scape, with shattered ships, unto the isle,\nWe might make easy prey of fugitives\nAnd slay them there, and from the washing tides\nRescue our friends. It fell out otherwise\nThan he divined, for when, by aid of Heaven,\nThe Hellenes held the victory on the sea,\nTheir sailors then and there begirt themselves\nWith brazen mail and bounded from their ships,\nAnd then enringed the islet, point by point,\nSo that our Persians in bewilderment\nKnew not which way to turn. On every side,\nBattered with stones, they fell, while arrows flew\nFrom many a string, and smote them to the death.\nThen, at the last, with simultaneous rush\nThe foe came bursting on us, hacked and hewed\nTo fragments all that miserable band,\nTill not a soul of them was left alive.\nThen Xerxes saw disaster’s depth, and shrieked,\nFrom where he sat on high, surveying all—\nA lofty eminence, beside the brine,\nWhence all his armament lay clear in view.\nHis robe he rent, with loud and bitter wail,\nAnd to his land-force swiftly gave command\nAnd fled, with shame beside him! Now, lament\nThat second woe, upon the first imposed!\nATOSSA.\nOut on thee, Fortune! thou hast foiled the hope\nAnd power of Persia: to this bitter end\nMy son went forth to wreak his great revenge\nOn famous Athens! all too few they seemed,\nOur men who died upon the Fennel-field!\nVengeance for them my son had mind to take,\nAnd drew on his own head these whelming woes.\nBut thou, say on! the ships that ’scaped from wreck—\nWhere didst thou leave them? make thy story clear.\nMESSENGER.\nThe captains of the ships that still survived\nFled in disorder, scudding down the wind,\nThe while our land-force on Boeotian soil\nFell into ruin, some beside the springs\nDropping before they drank, and some outworn,\nPursued, and panting all their life away.\nThe rest of us our way to Phocis won,\nAnd thence to Doris and the Melian gulf,\nWhere with soft stream Spercheus laves the soil.\nThence to the northward did Phthiotis’ plain,\nAnd some Thessalian fortress, lend us aid,\nFor famine-pinched we were, and many died\nOf drought and hunger’s twofold present scourge.\nThence to Magnesia came we, and the land\nWhere Macedonians dwell, and crossed the ford\nOf Axius, and Bolbe’s reedy fen,\nAnd mount Pangaeus, in Edonian land.\nThere, in the very night we came, the god\nBrought winter ere its time, from bank to bank\nFreezing the holy Strymon’s tide. Each man\nWho heretofore held lightly of the gods,\nNow crouched and proffered prayer to Earth and Heaven!\nThen, after many orisons performed,\nThe army ventured on the frozen ford:\nYet only those who crossed before the sun\nShed its warm rays, won to the farther side.\nFor soon the fervour of the glowing orb\nDid with its keen rays pierce the ice-bound stream,\nAnd men sank through and thrust each other down—\nBest was his lot whose breath was stifled first!\nBut all who struggled through and gained the bank,\nToilfully wending through the land of Thrace\nHave made their way, a sorry, scanted few,\nUnto this homeland. Let the city now\nLament and yearn for all the loved and lost.\nMy tale is truth, yet much untold remains\nOf ills that Heaven hath hurled upon our land.\nCHORUS.\nSpirit of Fate, too heavy were thy feet,\nThose ill to match! that sprang on Persia’s realm.\nATOSSA.\nWoe for the host, to wrack and ruin hurled!\nO warning of the night, prophetic dream!\nThou didst foreshadow clearly all the doom,\nWhile ye, old men, made light of woman’s fears!\nAh well—yet, as your divination ruled\nThe meaning of the sign, I hold it good,\nFirst, that I put up prayer unto the gods,\nAnd, after that, forth from my palace bring\nThe sacrificial cake, the offering due\nTo Earth and to the spirits of the dead.\nToo well I know it is a timeless rite\nOver a finished thing that cannot change!\nBut yet—I know not—there may come of it\nAlleviation for the after time.\nYou it beseems, in view of what hath happed,\nT’ advise with loyal hearts our loyal guards:\nAnd to my son—if, ere my coming forth,\nHe should draw hitherward—give comfort meet,\nEscort him to the palace in all state,\nLest to these woes he add another woe!\n[Exit ATOSSA.]\nCHORUS.\nZeus, lord and king! to death and nought\nOur countless host by thee is brought.\nDeep in the gloom of death, to-day,\nLie Susa and Ecbatana:\nHow many a maid in sorrow stands\nAnd rends her tire with tender hands!\nHow tears run down, in common pain\nAnd woeful mourning for the slain!\nO delicate in dole and grief,\nYe Persian women! past relief\nIs now your sorrow! to the war\nYour loved ones went and come no more!\nGone from you is your joy and pride—\nSevered the bridegroom from the bride—\nThe wedded couch luxurious\nIs widowed now, and all the house\nPines ever with insatiate sighs,\nAnd we stand here and bid arise,\nFor those who forth in ardour went\nAnd come not back, the loud lament!\nLand of the East, thou mournest for the host,\nBereft of all thy sons, alas the day!\nFor them whom Xerxes led hath Xerxes lost—\nXerxes who wrecked the fleet, and flung our hopes away!\nHow came it that Darius once controlled,\nAnd without scathe, the army of the bow,\nLoved by the folk of Susa, wise and bold?\nNow is the land-force lost, the shipmen sunk below!\nAh for the ships that bore them, woe is me!\nBore them to death and doom! the crashing prows\nOf fierce Ionian oarsmen swept the sea,\nAnd death was in their wake, and shipwreck murderous!\nLate, late and hardly—if true tales they tell—\nDid Xerxes flee along the wintry way\nAnd snows of Thrace—but ah, the first who fell\nLie by the rocks or float upon Cychrea’s bay!\nMourn, each and all! waft heavenward your cry,\nStung to the soul, bereaved, disconsolate!\nWail out your anguish, till it pierce the sky,\nIn shrieks of deep despair, ill-omened, desperate!\nThe dead are drifting, yea, are gnawed upon\nBy voiceless children of the stainless sea,\nOr battered by the surge! we mourn and groan\nFor husbands gone to death, for childless agony!\nAlas the aged men, who mourn to-day\nThe ruinous sorrows that the gods ordain!\nO’er the wide Asian land, the Persian sway\nCan force no tribute now, and can no rule sustain.\nYea, men will crouch no more to fallen power\nAnd kingship overthrown! the whole land o’er,\nMen speak the thing they will, and from this hour\nThe folk whom Xerxes ruled obey his word no more.\nThe yoke of force is broken from the neck—\nThe isle of Ajax and th’ encircling wave\nReek with a bloody crop of death and wreck\nOf Persia’s fallen power, that none can lift nor save!\nRe-enter ATOSSA, in mourning robes.\nATOSSA.\nFriends, whosoe’er is versed in human ills,\nKnoweth right well that when a wave of woe\nComes on a man, he sees in all things fear;\nWhile, in flood-tide of fortune, ’tis his mood\nTo take that fortune as unchangeable,\nWafting him ever forward. Mark me now—\nThe gods’ thwart purpose doth confront mine eyes,\nAnd all is terror to me; in mine ears\nThere sounds a cry, but not of triumph now—\nSo am I scared at heart by woe so great.\nTherefore I wend forth from the house anew,\nBorne in no car of state, nor robed in pride\nAs heretofore, but bringing, for the sire\nWho did beget my son, libations meet\nFor holy rites that shall appease the dead—\nThe sweet white milk, drawn from a spotless cow,\nThe oozing drop of golden honey, culled\nBy the flower-haunting bee, and therewithal\nPure draughts of water from a virgin spring;\nAnd lo! besides, the stainless effluence,\nBorn of the wild vine’s bosom, shining store\nTreasured to age, this bright and luscious wine.\nAnd eke the fragrant fruit upon the bough\nOf the grey olive-tree, which lives its life\nIn sprouting leafage, and the twining flowers,\nBright children of the earth’s fertility.\nBut you, O friends! above these offerings poured\nTo reconcile the dead, ring out your dirge\nTo summon up Darius from the shades,\nHimself a shade; and I will pour these draughts,\nWhich earth shall drink, unto the gods of hell.\nCHORUS.\nQueen, by the Persian land adored,\nBy thee be this libation poured,\nPassing to those who hold command\nOf dead men in the spirit-land!\nAnd we will sue, in solemn chant,\nThat gods who do escort the dead\nIn nether realms, our prayer may grant—\nBack to us be Darius led!\nO Earth, and Hermes, and the king\nOf Hades, our Darius bring!\nFor if, beyond the prayers we prayed,\nHe knoweth aught of help or aid,\nHe, he alone, in realms below,\nCan speak the limit of our woe!\nDoth he hear me, the king we adored, who is god among gods of the dead?\nDoth he hear me send out in my sorrow the pitiful, manifold cry,\nThe sobbing lament and appeal? is the voice of my suffering sped\nTo the realm of the shades? doth he hear me and pity my sorrowful sigh?\nO Earth, and ye Lords of the dead! release ye that spirit of might,\nWho in Susa the palace was born! let him rise up once more to the light!\nThere is none like him, none of all\nThat e’er were laid in Persian sepulchres!\nBorne forth he was to honoured burial,\nA royal heart! and followed by our tears.\nGod of the dead, O give him back to us,\nDarius, ruler glorious!\nHe never wasted us with reckless war—\nGod, counsellor, and king, beneath a happy star!\nAncient of days and king, awake and come—\nRise o’er the mounded tomb!\nRise, plant thy foot, with saffron sandal shod\nFather to us, and god!\nRise with thy diadem, O sire benign,\nUpon thy brow!\nList to the strange new sorrows of thy line,\nSire of a woeful son!\nA mist of fate and hell is round us now,\nAnd all the city’s flower to death is done!\nAlas, we wept thee once, and weep again!\nO Lord of lords, by recklessness twofold\nThe land is wasted of its men,\nAnd down to death are rolled\nWreckage of sail and oar,\nShips that are ships no more,\nAnd bodies of the slain!\nThe GHOST OF DARIUS rises.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nYe aged Persians, truest of the true,\nCoevals of the youth that once was mine,\nWhat troubleth now our city? harken, how\nIt moans and beats the breast and rends the plain!\nAnd I, beholding how my consort stood\nBeside my tomb, was moved with awe, and took\nThe gift of her libation graciously.\nBut ye are weeping by my sepulchre,\nAnd, shrilling forth a sad, evoking cry,\nSummon me mournfully, Arise, arise.\nNo light thing is it, to come back from death,\nFor, in good sooth, the gods of nether gloom\nAre quick to seize but late and loth to free!\nYet among them I dwell as one in power—\nAnd lo, I come! now speak, and speed your words,\nLest I be blamed for tarrying overlong!\nWhat new disaster broods o’er Persia’s realm?\nCHORUS.\nWith awe on thee I gaze,\nAnd, standing face to face,\nI tremble as I did in olden days!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay, but as I rose to earth again, obedient to your call,\nPrithee, tarry not in parley! be one word enough for all—\nSpeak and gaze on me unshrinking, neither let my face appal!\nCHORUS.\nI tremble to reveal,\nYet tremble to conceal\nThings hard for friends to feel!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay, but if the old-time terror on your spirit keeps its hold,\nSpeak thou, O royal lady who didst couch with me of old!\nStay thy weeping and lamenting and to me reveal the truth—\nSpeak! for man is born to sorrow; yea, the proverb sayeth sooth!\n’Tis the doom of mortal beings, if they live to see old age,\nTo suffer bale, by land and sea, through war and tempest’s rage.\nATOSSA.\nO thou whose blissful fate on earth all mortal weal excelled—\nWho, while the sunlight touched thine eyes, the lord of all wert held!\nA god to Persian men thou wert, in bliss and pride and fame—\nI hold thee blest too in thy death, or e’er the ruin came!\nAlas, Darius! one brief word must tell thee all the tale—\nThe Persian power is in the dust, gone down in blood and bale!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nSpeak—by what chance? did man rebel, or pestilence descend?\nATOSSA.\nNeither! by Athens’ fatal shores our army met its end.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWhich of my children led our host to Athens? speak and say.\nATOSSA.\nThe froward Xerxes, leaving all our realm to disarray.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWas it with army or with fleet on folly’s quest he went?\nATOSSA.\nWith both alike, a twofold front of double armament.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAnd how then did so large a host on foot pass o’er the sea?\nATOSSA.\nHe bridged the ford of Helle’s strait by artful carpentry.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHow? could his craft avail to span the torrent of that tide?\nATOSSA.\n’Tis sooth I say—some unknown power did fatal help provide!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas, that power in malice came, to his bewilderment!\nATOSSA.\nAlas, we see the end of all, the ruin on us sent.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nSpeak, tell me how they fared therein, that thus ye mourn and weep?\nATOSSA.\nDisaster to the army came, through ruin on the deep!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nIs all undone? hath all the folk gone down before the foe?\nATOSSA.\nYea, hark to Susa’s mourning cry for warriors laid low!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas for all our gallant aids, our Persia’s help and pride!\nATOSSA.\nAy! old with young, the Bactrian force hath perished at our side!\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nAlas, my son! what gallant youths hath he sent down to death!\nATOSSA.\nAlone, or with a scanty guard—for so the rumour saith—\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHe came—but how, and to what end? doth aught of hope remain?\nATOSSA.\nWith joy he reached the bridge that spanned the Hellespontine main.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nHow? is he safe, in Persian land? speak soothly, yea or nay!\nATOSSA.\nClear and more clear the rumour comes, for no man to gainsay.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWoe for the oracle fulfilled, the presage of the war\nLaunched on my son, by will of Zeus! I deemed our doom afar\nIn lap of time; but, if a king push forward to his fate,\nThe god himself allures to death that man infatuate!\nSo now the very fount of woe streams out on those I loved,\nAnd mine own son, unwisely bold, the truth hereof hath proved!\nHe sought to shackle and control the Hellespontine wave,\nThat rushes from the Bosphorus, with fetters of a slave!—\nTo curb and bridge, with welded links, the streaming water-way,\nAnd guide across the passage broad his manifold array!\nAh, folly void of counsel! he deemed that mortal wight\nCould thwart the will of Heaven itself and curb Poseidon’s might!\nWas it not madness? much I fear lest all my wealth and store\nPass from my treasure-house, to be the snatcher’s prize once more!\nATOSSA.\nSuch is the lesson, ah, too late! to eager Xerxes taught—\nTrusting random counsellors and hare-brained men of nought,\nWho said Darius mighty wealth and fame to us did bring,\nBut thou art nought, a blunted spear, a palace-keeping king!\nUnto those sorry counsellors a ready ear he lent,\nAnd led away to Hellas’ shore his fated armament.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nTherefore through them hath come calamity\nMost huge and past forgetting; nor of old\nDid ever such extermination fall\nUpon the city Susa. Long ago\nZeus in his power this privilege bestowed,\nThat with a guiding sceptre one sole man\nShould rule this Asian land of flock and herd.\nOver the folk a Mede, Astyages,\nDid grasp the power: then Cyaxares ruled\nIn his sire’s place, and held the sway aright,\nSteering his state with watchful wariness.\nThird in succession, Cyrus, blest of Heaven,\nHeld rule and ’stablished peace for all his clan:\nLydian and Phrygian won he to his sway,\nAnd wide Ionia to his yoke constrained,\nFor the god favoured his discretion sage.\nFourth in the dynasty was Cyrus’ son,\nAnd fifth was Mardus, scandal of his land\nAnd ancient lineage. Him Artaphrenes,\nHardy of heart, within his palace slew,\nAided by loyal plotters, set for this.\nAnd I too gained the lot for which I craved,\nAnd oftentimes led out a goodly host,\nYet never brought disaster such as this\nUpon the city. But my son is young\nAnd reckless in his youth, and heedeth not\nThe warnings of my mouth. Mark this, my friends,\nBorn with my birth, coeval with mine age—\nNot all we kings who held successive rule\nHave wrought, combined, such ruin as my son!\nCHORUS.\nHow then, O King Darius? whitherward\nDost thou direct thy warning? from this plight\nHow can we Persians fare towards hope again?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nBy nevermore assailing Grecian lands,\nEven tho’ our Median force be double theirs—\nFor the land’s self protects its denizens.\nCHORUS.\nHow meanest thou? by what defensive power?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nShe wastes by famine a too countless foe.\nCHORUS.\nBut we will bring a host more skilled than huge.\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nWhy, e’en that army, camped in Hellas still,\nShall never win again to home and weal!\nCHORUS.\nHow say’st thou? will not all the Asian host\nPass back from Europe over Helle’s ford?\nGHOST OF DARIUS.\nNay—scarce a tithe of all those myriads,\nIf man may trust the oracles of Heaven\nWhen he beholds the things already wrought,\nNot false with true, but true with no word false\nIf what I trow be truth, my son has left\nA chosen rear-guard of our host, in whom\nHe trusts, now, with a random confidence!\nThey tarry where Asopus laves the ground\nWith rills that softly bless Boeotia’s plain—\nThere is it fated for them to endure\nThe very crown of misery and doom,\nRequital for their god-forgetting pride!\nFor why? they raided Hellas, had the heart\nTo wrong the images of holy gods,\nAnd give the shrines and temples to the flame!\nDefaced and dashed from sight the altars fell,\nAnd each god’s image, from its pedestal\nThrust and flung down, in dim confusion lies!\nTherefore, for outrage vile, a doom as dark\nThey suffer, and yet more shall undergo—\nThey touch no bottom in the swamp of doom,\nBut round them rises, bubbling up, the ooze!\nSo deep shall lie the gory clotted mass\nOf corpses by the Dorian spear transfixed\nUpon Plataea’s field! yea, piles of slain\nTo the third generation shall attest\nBy silent eloquence to those that see—\nLet not a mortal vaunt him overmuch.\nFor pride grows rankly, and to ripeness brings\nThe curse of fate, and reaps, for harvest, tears!\nTherefore when ye behold, for deeds like these,\nSuch stern requital paid, remember then\nAthens and Hellas. Let no mortal wight,\nHolding too lightly of his present weal\nAnd passionate for more, cast down and spill\nThe mighty cup of his prosperity!\nDoubt not that over-proud and haughty souls\nZeus lours in wrath, exacting the account.\nTherefore, with wary warning, school my son,\nThough he be lessoned by the gods already,\nTo curb the vaunting that affronts high Heaven!\nAnd thou, O venerable Mother-queen,\nBeloved of Xerxes, to the palace pass\nAnd take therefrom such raiment as befits\nThy son, and go to meet him: for his garb\nIn this extremity of grief hangs rent\nAround his body, woefully unstitched,\nMere tattered fragments of once royal robes!\nGo thou to him, speak soft and soothing words—\nThee, and none other, will he bear to hear,\nAs well I know. But I must pass away\nFrom earth above, unto the nether gloom;\nTherefore, old men, take my farewell, and clasp,\nEven amid the ruin of this time,\nUnto your souls the pleasure of the day,\nFor dead men have no profit of their gold!\n[The GHOST OF DARIUS sinks.]\nCHORUS.\nAlas, I thrill with pain for Persia’s woes—\nMany fulfilled, and others hard at hand!\nATOSSA.\nO spirit of the race, what sorrows crowd\nUpon me! and this anguish stings me worst,\nThat round my royal son’s dishonoured form\nHang rags and tatters, degradation deep!\nI will away, and, bringing from within\nA seemly royal robe, will straightway strive\nTo meet and greet my son: foul scorn it were\nTo leave our dearest in his hour of shame.\n[Exit ATOSSA.]\nCHORUS.\nAh glorious and goodly they were, the life and the lot that we gained,\nThe cities we held in our hand when the monarch invincible reigned,\nThe king that was good to his realm, sufficing, fulfilled of his sway,\nA lord that was peer of the gods, the pride of the bygone day!\nThen could we show to the skies great hosts and a glorious name,\nAnd laws that were stable in might; as towers they guarded our fame!\nThere without woe or disaster we came from the foe and the fight,\nIn triumph, enriched with the spoil, to the land and the city’s delight.\nWhat towns ere the Halys he passed! what towns ere he came to the West,\nTo the main and the isles of the Strymon, and the Thracian region possess’d!\nAnd those that stand back from the main, enringed by their fortified wall,\nGave o’er to Darius, the king, the sceptre and sway over all!\nThose too by the channel of Helle, where southward it broadens and glides,\nBy the inlets, Propontis! of thee, and the strait of the Pontic tides,\nAnd the isles that lie fronting our sea-board, and the Eastland looks on each one,\nLesbo and Chios and Paros, and Samos with olive-trees grown,\nAnd Naxos, and Myconos’ rock, and Tenos with Andros hard by,\nAnd isles that in midmost Aegean, aloof from the continent, lie—\nAnd Lemnos and Icaros’ hold—all these to his sceptre were bowed,\nAnd Cnidos and neighbouring Rhodes, and Soli, and Paphos the proud,\nAnd Cyprian Salamis, name-child of her who hath wrought us this wrong!\nYea, and all the Ionian tract, where the Greek-born inhabitants throng,\nAnd the cities are teeming with gold—Darius was lord of them all,\nAnd, great by his wisdom, he ruled, and ever there came to his call,\nIn stalwart array and unfailing, the warrior chiefs of our land,\nAnd mingled allies from the tribes who bowed to his conquering hand!\nBut now there are none to gainsay that the gods are against us; we lie\nSubdued in the havoc of wreck, and whelmed by the wrath of the sky!\nEnter XERXES in disarray.\nXERXES.\nAlas the day, that I should fall\nInto this grimmest fate of all,\nThis ruin doubly unforeseen!\nOn Persia’s land what power of Fate\nDescends, what louring gloom of hate?\nHow shall I bear my teen?\nMy limbs are loosened where they stand,\nWhen I behold this aged band—\nOh God! I would that I too, I,\nAmong the men who went to die,\nWere whelmed in earth by Fate’s command!\nCHORUS.\nAh welladay, my King! ah woe\nFor all our heroes’ overthrow—\nFor all the gallant host’s array,\nFor Persia’s honour, pass’d away,\nFor glory and heroic sway\nMown down by Fortune’s hand to-day!\nHark, how the kingdom makes its moan,\nFor youthful valour lost and gone,\nBy Xerxes shattered and undone!\nHe, he hath crammed the maw of hell\nWith bowmen brave, who nobly fell,\nTheir country’s mighty armament,\nTen thousand heroes deathward sent!\nAlas, for all the valiant band,\nO king and lord! thine Asian land\nDown, down upon its knee is bent!\nXERXES.\nAlas, a lamentable sound,\nA cry of ruth! for I am found\nA curse to land and lineage,\nWith none my sorrow to assuage!\nCHORUS.\nAlas, a death-song desolate\nI send forth, for thy home-coming!\nA scream, a dirge for woe and fate,\nSuch as the Asian mourners sing,\nA sorry and ill-omened tale\nOf tears and shrieks and Eastern wail!\nXERXES.\nAy, launch the woeful sorrow’s cry,\nThe harsh, discordant melody,\nFor lo, the power, we held for sure,\nHath turned to my discomfiture!\nCHORUS.\nYea, dirges, dirges manifold\nWill I send forth, for warriors bold,\nFor the sea-sorrow of our host!\nThe city mourns, and I must wail\nWith plashing tears our sorrow’s tale,\nLamenting for the loved and lost!\nXERXES.\nAlas, the god of war, who sways\nThe scales of fight in diverse ways,\nGives glory to Ionia!\nIonian ships, in fenced array,\nHave reaped their harvest in the bay,\nA darkling harvest-field of Fate,\nA sea, a shore, of doom and hate!\nCHORUS.\nCry out, and learn the tale of woe!\nWhere are thy comrades? where the band\nWho stood beside thee, hand in hand,\nA little while ago?\nWhere now hath Pharandákes gone,\nWhere Psammis, and where Pelagon?\nWhere now is brave Agdabatas,\nAnd Susas too, and Datamas?\nHath Susiscanes past away,\nThe chieftain of Ecbatana?\nXERXES.\nI left them, mangled castaways,\nFlung from their Tyrian deck, and tossed\nOn Salaminian water-ways,\nFrom surging tides to rocky coast!\nCHORUS.\nAlack, and is Pharnuchus slain,\nAnd Ariomardus, brave in vain?\nWhere is Seualces’ heart of fire?\nLilaeus, child of noble sire?\nAre Tharubis and Memphis sped?\nHystaechmas, Artembáres dead?\nAnd where is brave Masistes, where?\nSum up death’s count, that I may hear!\nXERXES.\nAlas, alas, they came, their eyes surveyed\nAncestral Athens on that fatal day.\nThen with a rending struggle were they laid\nUpon the land, and gasped their life away!\nCHORUS.\nAnd Batanochus’ child, Alpistus great,\nSurnamed the Eye of State—\nSaw you and left you him who once of old\nTen thousand thousand fighting-men enrolled?\nHis sire was child of Sesamas, and he\nFrom Megabates sprang. Ah, woe is me,\nThou king of evil fate!\nHast thou lost Parthus, lost Oebares great?\nAlas, the sorrow! blow succeedeth blow\nOn Persia’s pride; thou tellest woe on woe!\nXERXES.\nBitter indeed the pang for comrades slain,\nThe brave and bold! thou strikest to my soul\nPain, pain beyond forgetting, hateful pain.\nMy inner spirit sobs and sighs with dole!\nCHORUS.\nAnother yet we yearn to see,\nAnd see not! ah, thy chivalry,\nXanthis, thou chief of Mardian men\nCountless! and thou, Anchares bright,\nAnd ye, whose cars controlled the fight,\nArsaces and Diaixis wight,\nKegdadatas, Lythimnas dear,\nAnd Tolmus, greedy of the spear!\nI stand bereft! not in thy train\nCome they, as erst! ah, ne’er again\nShall they return unto our eyes,\nCar-borne, ’neath silken canopies!\nXERXES.\nYea, gone are they who mustered once the host!\nCHORUS.\nYea, yea, forgotten, lost!\nXERXES.\nAlas, the woe and cost!\nCHORUS.\nAlas, ye heavenly powers!\nYe wrought a sorrow past belief,\nA woe, of woes the chief!\nWith aspect stern, upon us Ate looms!\nXERXES.\nSmitten are we—time tells no heavier blow!\nCHORUS.\nSmitten! the doom is plain!\nXERXES.\nCurse upon curse and pang on pang we know!\nCHORUS.\nWith the Ionian power\nWe clashed, in evil hour!\nWoe falls on Persia’s race, yea, woe again, again!\nXERXES.\nYea, smitten am I, and my host is all to ruin hurled!\nCHORUS.\nYea verily—in mighty wreck hath sunk the Persian world!\nXERXES.\n(holding up a torn robe and a quiver)\nSee you this tattered rag of pride?\nCHORUS.\nI see it, welladay!\nXERXES.\nSee you this quiver?\nCHORUS.\nSay, hath aught survived and ’scaped the fray?\nXERXES.\nA store for darts it was, erewhile!\nCHORUS.\nRemain but two or three!\nXERXES.\nNo aid is left!\nCHORUS.\nIonian folk such darts, unfearing, see!\nXERXES.\nRight resolute they are!

    "content":"PROMETHEUS BOUND\nARGUMENT\nIn the beginning, Ouranos and Gaia held sway over Heaven and Earth. And manifold children were born unto them, of whom were Cronos, and Okeanos, and the Titans, and the Giants. But Cronos cast down his father Ouranos, and ruled in his stead, until Zeus his son cast him down in his turn, and became King of Gods and men. Then were the Titans divided, for some had good will unto Cronos, and others unto Zeus; until Prometheus, son of the Titan Iapetos, by wise counsel, gave the victory to Zeus. But Zeus held the race of mortal men in scorn, and was fain to destroy them from the face of the earth; yet Prometheus loved them, and gave secretly to them the gift of fire, and arts whereby they could prosper upon the earth. Then was Zeus sorely angered with Prometheus, and bound him upon a mountain, and afterward overwhelmed him in an earthquake, and devised other torments against him for many ages; yet could he not slay Prometheus, for he was a God.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nSTRENGTH AND FORCE.\nHEPHAESTUS.\nPROMETHEUS.\nCHORUS OF SEA-NYMPHS.\nDAUGHTERS OF OCEANUS.\nOCEANUS.\nIO.\nHERMES.\nScene—A rocky ravine in the mountains of Scythia.\nSTRENGTH.\nLo, the earth’s bound and limitary land,\nThe Scythian steppe, the waste untrod of men!\nLook to it now, Hephaestus—thine it is,\nThy Sire obeying, this arch-thief to clench\nAgainst the steep-down precipice of rock,\nWith stubborn links of adamantine chain.\nLook thou: thy flower, the gleaming plastic fire,\nHe stole and lent to mortal man—a sin\nThat gods immortal make him rue to-day,\nLessoned hereby to own th’ omnipotence\nOf Zeus, and to repent his love to man!\nHEPHAESTUS.\nO Strength and Force, for you the best of Zeus\nStands all achieved, and nothing bars your will:\nBut I—I dare not bind to storm-vext cleft\nOne of our race, immortal as are we.\nYet, none the less, necessity constrains,\nFor Zeus, defied, is heavy in revenge!\n(To PROMETHEUS)\nO deep-devising child of Themis sage,\nSmall will have I to do, or thou to bear,\nWhat yet we must. Beyond the haunt of man\nUnto this rock, with fetters grimly forged,\nI must transfix and shackle up thy limbs,\nWhere thou shalt mark no voice nor human form,\nBut, parching in the glow and glare of sun,\nThy body’s flower shall suffer a sky-change;\nAnd gladly wilt thou hail the hour when Night\nShall in her starry robe invest the day,\nOr when the Sun shall melt the morning rime.\nBut, day or night, for ever shall the load\nOf wasting agony, that may not pass,\nWear thee away; for know, the womb of Time\nHath not conceived a power to set thee free.\nSuch meed thou hast, for love toward mankind\nFor thou, a god defying wrath of gods,\nBeyond the ordinance didst champion men,\nAnd for reward shalt keep a sleepless watch,\nStiff-kneed, erect, nailed to this dismal rock,\nWith manifold laments and useless cries\nAgainst the will inexorable of Zeus.\nHard is the heart of fresh-usurpèd power!\nSTRENGTH.\nEnough of useless ruth! why tarriest thou?\nWhy pitiest one whom all gods wholly hate,\nOne who to man gave o’er thy privilege?\nHEPHAESTUS.\nKinship and friendship wring my heart for him.\nSTRENGTH.\nAy—but how disregard our Sire’s command?\nIs not thy pity weaker than thy fear?\nHEPHAESTUS.\nRuthless as ever, brutal to the full!\nSTRENGTH.\nTears can avail him nothing: strive not thou,\nNor waste thine efforts thus unaidingly.\nHEPHAESTUS.\nOut on my cursed mastery of steel!\nSTRENGTH.\nWhy curse it thus?

The destiny ordained\nI must endure to the best, for well I wot\nThat none may challenge with Necessity.\nYet is it past my patience, to reveal,\nOr to conceal, these issues of my doom.\nSince I to mortals brought prerogatives,\nUnto this durance dismal am I bound:\nYea, I am he who in a fennel-stalk,\nBy stealthy sleight, purveyed the fount of fire,\nThe teacher, proven thus, and arch-resource\nOf every art that aideth mortal men.\nSuch was my sin: I earn its recompense,\nRock-riveted, and chained in height and cold.\n[A pause.]\nListen! what breath of sound,\nwhat fragrance soft hath risen\nUpward to me? is it some godlike essence,\nOr being half-divine, or mortal presence?\nWho to the world’s end comes, unto my craggy prison?\nCraves he the sight of pain, or what would he behold?\nGaze on a god in tortures manifold,\nHeinous to Zeus, and scorned by all\nWhose footsteps tread the heavenly hall,\nBecause too deeply, from on high,\nI pitied man’s mortality!\nHark, and again! that fluttering sound\nOf wings that whirr and circle round,\nAnd their light rustle thrills the air—\nHow all things that unseen draw near\nAre to me Fear!\nEnter the CHORUS OF OCEANIDES in winged cars.\nCHORUS.\nAh, fear us not! as friends, with rivalry\nOf swiftly-vying wings, we came together\nUnto this rock and thee!\nWith our sea-sire we pleaded hard, until\nWe won him to our will,\nAnd swift the wafting breezes bore us hither.\nThe heavy hammer’s steely blow\nThrilled to our ocean-cavern from afar,\nBanished soft shyness from our maiden brow,\nAnd with unsandalled feet we come, in winged car!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAh well-a-day! ye come, ye come\nFrom the Sea-Mother’s teeming home—\nChildren of Tethys and the sire\nWho around Earth rolls, gyre on gyre,\nHis sleepless ocean-tide!\nLook on me—shackled with what chain,\nUpon this chasm’s beetling side\nI must my dismal watch sustain!\nCHORUS.\nYea, I behold, Prometheus! and my fears\nDraw swiftly o’er mine eyes a mist fulfilled of tears,\nWhen I behold thy frame\nBound, wasting on the rock, and put to shame\nBy adamantine chains!\nThe rudder and the rule of Heaven\nAre to strange pilots given:\nZeus with new laws and strong caprice holds sway,\nUnkings the ancient Powers, their might constrains,\nAnd thrusts their pride away!\nPROMETHEUS.\nHad he but hurled me, far beneath\nThe vast and ghostly halls of Death,\nDown to the limitless profound\nOf Tartarus, in fetters bound,\nFixed by his unrelenting hand!\nSo had no man, nor God on high,\nExulted o’er mine agony—\nBut now, a sport to wind and sky,\nMocked by my foes, I stand!\nCHORUS.\nWhat God can wear such ruthless heart\nAs to delight in ill?\nWho in thy sorrow bears not part?\nZeus, Zeus alone! for he, with wrathful will,\nClenched and inflexible,\nBears down Heaven’s race—nor end shall be, till hate\nHis soul shall satiate,\nOr till, by some device, some other hand\nShall wrest from him his sternly-clasped command!\nPROMETHEUS.\nYet,—though in shackles close and strong\nI lie in wasting torments long,—\nYet the new tyrant, ’neath whose nod\nCowers down each blest subservient god,\nOne day, far hence, my help shall need,\nThe destined stratagem to read,\nWhereby, in some yet distant day,\nZeus shall be reaved of pride and sway:\nAnd no persuasion’s honied spell\nShall lure me on, the tale to tell;\nAnd no stern threat shall make me cower\nAnd yield the secret to his power,\nUntil his purpose be foregone,\nAnd shackles yield, and he atone\nThe deep despite that he hath done!\nCHORUS.\nO strong in hardihood, thou striv’st amain\nAgainst the stress of pain!\nBut yet too free, too resolute thy tongue\nIn challenging thy wrong!\nAh, shuddering dread doth make my spirit quiver,\nAnd o’er thy fate sits Fear!\nI see not to what shore of safety ever\nThy bark can steer—\nIn depths unreached the will of Zeus doth dwell,\nHidden, implacable!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy, stern is Zeus, and Justice stands,\nWrenched to his purpose, in his hands—\nYet shall he learn, perforce, to know\nA milder mood, when falls the blow—\nHis ruthless wrath he shall lay still,\nAnd he and I with mutual will\nIn concord’s bond shall go.\nCHORUS.\nUnveil, say forth to us the tale entire,\nUnder what imputation Zeus laid hands\nOn thee, to rack thee thus with shameful pangs?\nTell us—unless the telling pain thee—all!\nPROMETHEUS.\nGrievous alike are these things for my tongue,\nGrievous for silence—rueful everyway.\nKnow that, when first the gods began their strife,\nAnd heaven was all astir with mutual feud—\nSome willing to fling Cronos from his throne,\nAnd set, forsooth, their Zeus on high as king,\nAnd other some in contrariety\nStriving to bar him from heaven’s throne for aye—\nThereon I sought to counsel for the best\nThe Titan brood of Ouranos and Earth;\nYet I prevailed not, for they held in scorn\nMy glozing wiles, and, in their hardy pride,\nDeemed that sans effort they could grasp the sway.\nBut, for my sake, my mother Themis oft,\nAnd Earth, one symbol of names manifold,\nHad held me warned, how in futurity\nIt stood ordained that not by force or power,\nBut by some wile, the victors must prevail.\nIn such wise I interpreted; but they\nDeigned not to cast their heed thereon at all.\nThen, of things possible, I deemed it best,\nJoining my mother’s wisdom to mine own,\nTo range myself with Zeus, two wills in one.\nThus, by device of mine, the murky depth\nOf Tartarus enfoldeth Cronos old\nAnd those who strove beside him. Such the aid\nI gave the lord of heaven—my meed for which\nHe paid me thus, a penal recompense!\nFor ’tis the inward vice of tyranny,\nTo deem of friends as being secret foes.\nNow, to your question—hear me clearly show\nOn what imputed fault he tortures me.\nScarce was he seated on his father’s throne,\nWhen he began his doles of privilege\nAmong the lesser gods, allotting power\nIn trim division; while of mortal men\nNothing he recked, nor of their misery\nNay, even willed to blast their race entire\nTo nothingness, and breed another brood;\nAnd none but I was found to cross his will.\nI dared it, I alone; I rescued men\nFrom crushing ruin and th’ abyss of hell—\nTherefore am I constrained in chastisement\nGrievous to bear and piteous to behold,—\nYea, firm to feel compassion for mankind,\nMyself was held unworthy of the same—\nAy, beyond pity am I ranged and ruled\nTo sufferance—a sight that shames his sway!\nCHORUS.\nA heart of steel, a mould of stone were he,\nWho could complacently behold thy pains\nI came not here as craving for this sight,\nAnd, seeing it, I stand heart-wrung with pain.\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea truly, kindly eyes must pity me!\nCHORUS.\nSay, didst thou push transgression further still?\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy, man thro’ me ceased to foreknow his death.\nCHORUS.\nWhat cure couldst thou discover for this curse?\nPROMETHEUS.\nBlind hopes I sent to nestle in man’s heart.\nCHORUS.\nThis was a goodly gift thou gavest them.\nPROMETHEUS.\nYet more I gave them, even the boon of fire.\nCHORUS.\nWhat? radiant fire, to things ephemeral?\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea—many an art too shall they learn thereby!\nCHORUS.\nThen, upon imputation of such guilt,\nDoth Zeus without surcease torment thee thus?\nIs there no limit to thy course of pain?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNone, till his own will shall decree an end.\nCHORUS.\nAnd how shall he decree it? say, what hope?\nSeëst thou not thy sin? yet of that sin\nIt irks me sore to speak, as thee to hear.\nNay, no more words hereof; bethink thee now,\nFrom this ordeal how to find release.\nPROMETHEUS.\nEasy it is, for one whose foot is set\nOutside the slough of pain, to lesson well\nWith admonitions him who lies therein.\nWith perfect knowledge did I all I did,\nI willed to sin, and sinned, I own it all—\nI championed men, unto my proper pain.\nYet scarce I deemed that, in such cruel doom,\nWithering upon this skyey precipice,\nI should inherit lonely mountain crags,\nHere, in a vast tin-neighboured solitude.\nYet list not to lament my present pains,\nBut, stepping from your cars unto the ground,\nListen, the while I tell the future fates\nNow drawing near, until ye know the whole.\nGrant ye, O grant my prayer, be pitiful\nTo one now racked with woe! the doom of pain\nWanders, but settles, soon or late, on all.\nCHORUS.\nTo willing hearts, and schooled to feel,\nPrometheus, came thy tongue’s appeal;\nTherefore we leave, with lightsome tread,\nThe flying cars in which we sped—\nWe leave the stainless virgin air\nWhere winged creatures float and fare,\nAnd by thy side, on rocky land,\nThus gently we alight and stand,\nWilling, from end to end, to know\nThine history of woe.\nThe CHORUS alight from their winged cars.\nEnter OCEANUS mounted on a griffin.\nOCEANUS.\nThus, over leagues and leagues of space\nI come, Prometheus, to thy place—\nBy will alone, not rein, I guide\nThe winged thing on which I ride;\nAnd much, be sure, I mourn thy case—\nKinship is Pity’s bond, I trow;\nAnd, wert thou not akin, I vow\nNone other should have more than thou\nOf my compassion’s grace!\n’Tis said, and shall be proved; no skill\nHave I to gloze and feign goodwill!\nName but some mode of helpfulness,\nAnd thou wilt in a trice confess\nThat I, Oceanus, am best\nOf all thy friends, and trustiest.\nPROMETHEUS.\nHo, what a sight of marvel! what, thou too\nComest to contemplate my pains, and darest—\n(Yet how, I wot not!) leaving far behind\nThe circling tide, thy namefellow, and those\nRock-arched, self-hollowed caverns—thus to come\nUnto this land, whose womb bears iron ore?\nArt come to see my lot, resent with me\nThe ills I bear? Well, gaze thy fill! behold\nMe, friend of Zeus, part-author of his power—\nMark, in what ruthlessness he bows me down!\nOCEANUS.\nYea, I behold, Prometheus! and would warn\nThee, spite of all thy wisdom, for thy weal!\nLearn now thyself to know, and to renew\nA rightful spirit within thee, for, made new\nWith pride of place, sits Zeus among the gods!\nNow, if thou choosest to fling forth on him\nWords rough with anger thus and edged with scorn,\nZeus, though he sit aloof, afar, on high,\nMay hear thine utterance, and make thee deem\nHis present wrath a mere pretence of pain.\nBanish, poor wretch! the passion of thy soul,\nAnd seek, instead, acquittance from thy pangs!\nBelike my words seem ancientry to thee—\nSuch, natheless, O Prometheus, is the meed\nThat doth await the overweening tongue!\nMeek wert thou never, wilt not crouch to pain,\nBut, set amid misfortunes, cravest more!\nNow—if thou let thyself be schooled by me—\nThou must not kick against the goad. Thou knowest,\nA despot rules, harsh, resolute, supreme,\nWhose law is will. Yet shall I go to him,\nWith all endeavour to relieve thy plight—\nSo thou wilt curb the tempest of thy tongue!\nSurely thou knowest, in thy wisdom deep,\nThe saw—Who vaunts amiss, quick pain is his.\nPROMETHEUS.\nO enviable thou, and unaccused—\nThou who wast art and part in all I dared!\nAnd now, let be! make this no care of thine,\nFor Zeus is past persuasion—urge him not!\nLook to thyself, lest thine emprise thou rue.\nOCEANUS.\nThou hast more skill to school thy neighbour’s fault\nThan to amend thine own: ’tis proved and plain,\nBy fact, not hearsay, that I read this well.\nYet am I fixed to go—withhold me not—\nAssured I am, assured, that Zeus will grant\nThe boon I crave, the loosening of thy bonds.\nPROMETHEUS.\nIn part I praise thee, to the end will praise;\nGoodwill thou lackest not, but yet forbear\nThy further trouble! If thy heart be fain,\nBethink thee that thy toil avails me not.\nNay, rest thee well, aloof from danger’s brink!\nI will not ease my woe by base relief\nIn knowing others too involved therein.\nAway the thought! for deeply do I rue\nMy brother Atlas’ doom. Far off he stands\nIn sunset land, and on his shoulder bears\nThe pillar’d mountain-mass whose base is earth,\nWhose top is heaven, and its ponderous load\nToo great for any grasp. With pity too\nI saw Earth’s child, the monstrous thing of war,\nThat in Cilicia’s hollow places dwelt—\nTypho; I saw his hundred-headed form\nCrushed and constrained; yet once his stride was fierce,\nHis jaws gaped horror and their hiss was death,\nAnd all heaven’s host he challenged to the fray,\nWhile, as one vowed to storm the power of Zeus,\nForth from his eyes he shot a demon glare.\nIt skilled not: the unsleeping bolt of Zeus,\nThe downward levin with its rush of flame,\nSmote on him, and made dumb for evermore\nThe clamour of his vaunting: to the heart\nStricken he lay, and all that mould of strength\nSank thunder-shattered to a smouldering ash;\nAnd helpless now and laid in ruin huge\nHe lieth by the narrow strait of sea,\nCrushed at the root of Etna’s mountain-pile.\nHigh on the pinnacles whereof there sits\nHephaestus, sweltering at the forge; and thence\nOn some hereafter day shall burst and stream\nThe lava-floods, that shall with ravening fangs\nGnaw thy smooth lowlands, fertile Sicily!\nSuch ire shall Typho from his living grave\nSend seething up, such jets of fiery surge,\nHot and unslaked, altho’ himself be laid\nIn quaking ashes by Zeus’ thunderbolt.\nBut thou dost know hereof, nor needest me\nTo school thy sense: thou knowest safety’s road—\nWalk then thereon! I to the dregs will drain,\nTill Zeus relent from wrath, my present woe.\nOCEANUS.\nNay, but, Prometheus, know’st thou not the saw—\nWords can appease the angry soul’s disease?\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy—if in season one apply their salve,\nNot scorching wrath’s proud flesh with caustic tongue.\nOCEANUS.\nBut in wise thought and venturous essay\nPerceivest thou a danger? prithee tell!\nPROMETHEUS.\nI see a fool’s good nature, useless toil.\nOCEANUS.\nLet me be sick of that disease; I know,\nLoyalty, masked as folly, wins the way.\nPROMETHEUS.\nBut of thy blunder I shall bear the blame.\nOCEANUS.\nClearly, thy word would send me home again.\nPROMETHEUS.\nLest thy lament for me should bring thee hate.\nOCEANUS.\nHate from the newly-throned Omnipotence?\nPROMETHEUS.\nBe heedful—lest his will be wroth with thee!\nOCEANUS.\nThy doom, Prometheus, cries to me Beware!\nPROMETHEUS.\nMount, make away, discretion at thy side!\nOCEANUS.\nThy word is said to me in act to go:\nFor lo, my hippogriff with waving wings\nFans the smooth course of air, and fain is he\nTo rest his limbs within his ocean stall.\n[Exit OCEANUS.]\nCHORUS.\nFor the woe and the wreck and the doom, Prometheus I utter my sighs;\nO’er my cheek flows the fountain of tears from tender, compassionate eyes.\nFor stern and abhorred is the sway of Zeus on his self-sought throne,\nAnd ruthless the spear of his scorn, to the gods of the days that are done.\nAnd over the limitless earth goes up a disconsolate cry:\nYe were all so fair, and have fallen; so great and your might has gone by!\nSo wails with a mighty lament the voice of the mortals, who dwell\nIn the Eastland, the home of the holy, for thee and the fate that befel;\nAnd they of the Colchian land, the maidens whose arm is for war;\nAnd the Scythian bowmen, who roam by the lake of Maeotis afar;\nAnd the blossom of battling hordes, that flowers upon Caucasus’ height,\nWith clashing of lances that pierce, and with clamour of swords that smite.\nStrange is thy sorrow! one only I know who has suffered thy pain—\nAtlas the Titan, the god, in a ruthless, invincible chain!\nHe beareth for ever and ever the burden and poise of the sky,\nThe vault of the rolling heaven, and earth re-echoes his cry.\nThe depths of the sea are troubled; they mourn from their caverns profound,\nAnd the darkest and innermost hell moans deep with a sorrowful sound;\nAnd the rivers of waters, that flow from the fountains that spring without stain,\nAre as one in the great lamentation, and moan for thy piteous pain.\nPROMETHEUS.\nDeem not that I in pride or wilful scorn\nRestrain my speech; ’tis wistful memory\nThat rends my heart, when I behold myself\nAbased to wretchedness. To these new gods\nI and none other gave their lots of power\nIn full attainment; no more words hereof\nI speak—the tale ye know. But listen now\nUnto the rede of mortals and their woes,\nAnd how their childish and unreasoning state\nWas changed by me to consciousness and thought.\nYet not in blame of mortals will I speak,\nBut as in proof of service wrought to them.\nFor, in the outset, eyes they had and saw not;\nAnd ears they had but heard not; age on age,\nLike unsubstantial shapes in vision seen,\nThey groped at random in the world of sense,\nNor knew to link their building, brick with brick,\nNor how to turn its aspect to the sun,\nNor how to join the beams by carpentry,\nIn hollowed caves they dwelt, as emmets dwell,\nWeak feathers for each blast, in sunless caves.\nNor had they certain forecast of the cold,\nNor of the advent of the flowery spring,\nNor of the fruitful summer. All they wrought,\nUnreasoning they wrought, till I made clear\nThe laws of rising stars, and inference dim,\nMore hard to learn, of what their setting showed.\nI taught to them withal that art of arts,\nThe lore of number, and the written word\nThat giveth sense to sound, the tool wherewith\nThe gift of memory was wrought in all,\nAnd so came art and song. I too was first\nTo harness ’neath the yoke strong animals,\nObedient made to collar and to weight,\nThat they might bear whate’er of heaviest toil\nMortals endured before. For chariots too\nI trained, and docile service of the rein,\nSteeds, the delight of wealth and pomp and pride.\nI too, none other, for seafarers wrought\nTheir ocean-roaming canvas-wingèd cars.\nSuch arts of craft did I, unhappy I,\nContrive for mortals: now, no feint I have\nWhereby I may elude my present woe.\nCHORUS.\nA rueful doom is thine! distraught of soul,\nAnd all astray, and like some sorry leech\nArt thou, repining at thine own disease,\nUnskilled, unknowing of the needful cure.\nPROMETHEUS.\nMore wilt thou wonder when the rest thou hearest—\nWhat arts for them, what methods I devised.\nForemost was this: if any man fell sick,\nNo aiding art he knew, no saving food,\nNo curing oil nor draught, but all in lack\nOf remedies they dwindled, till I taught\nThe medicinal blending of soft drugs,\nWhereby they ward each sickness from their side.\nI ranged for them the methods manifold\nOf the diviner’s art; I first discerned\nWhich of night’s visions hold a truth for day,\nI read for them the lore of mystic sounds,\nInscrutable before; the omens seen\nWhich bless or ban a journey, and the flight\nOf crook-clawed birds, did I make clear to man—\nAnd how they soar upon the right, for weal,\nHow, on the left, for evil; how they dwell,\nEach in its kind, and what their loves and hates,\nAnd which can flock and roost in harmony.\nFrom me, men learned what deep significance\nLay in the smoothness of the entrails set\nFor sacrifice, and which, of various hues,\nShowed them a gift accepted of the gods;\nThey learned what streaked and varied comeliness\nOf gall and liver told; I led them, too,\n(By passing thro’ the flame the thigh-bones, wrapt\nIn rolls of fat, and th’ undivided chine),\nUnto the mystic and perplexing lore\nOf omens; and I cleared unto their eyes\nThe forecasts, dim and indistinct before,\nShown in the flickering aspect of a flame.\nOf these, enough is said. The other boons,\nStored in the womb of earth, in aid of men—\nCopper and iron, silver, gold withal—\nWho dares affirm he found them ere I found?\nNone—well I know—save who would babble lies!\nKnow thou, in compass of a single phrase—\nAll arts, for mortals’ use, Prometheus gave.\nCHORUS.\nNay, aid not mortal men beyond their due,\nHolding too light a reckoning of thyself\nAnd of thine own distress: good hope have I\nTo see thee once again from fetters free\nAnd matched with Zeus in parity of power.\nPROMETHEUS.\nNot yet nor thus hath Fate ordained the end—\nNot until age-long pains and countless woes\nHave bent and bowed me, shall my shackles fall;\nArt strives too feebly against destiny.\nCHORUS.\nBut what hand rules the helm of destiny?\nPROMETHEUS.\nThe triform Fates, and Furies unforgiving.\nCHORUS.\nThen is the power of Zeus more weak than theirs?\nPROMETHEUS.\nHe may not shun the fate ordained for him.\nCHORUS.\nWhat is ordained for him, save endless rule?\nPROMETHEUS.\nSeek not for answer: this thou may’st not learn.\nCHORUS.\nSurely thy silence hides some solemn thing.\nPROMETHEUS.\nThink on some other theme: ’tis not the hour,\nThis secret to unveil; in deepest dark\nBe it concealed: by guarding it shall I\nEscape at last from bonds, and scorn, and pain.\nCHORUS.\nO never may my weak and faint desire\nStrive against God most high—\nNever be slack in service, never tire\nOf sacred loyalty;\nNor fail to wend unto the altar-side,\nWhere with the blood of kine\nSteams up the offering, by the quenchless tide\nOf Ocean, Sire divine!\nBe this within my heart, indelible—\nOffend not with thy tongue!\nSweet, sweet it is, in cheering hopes to dwell,\nImmortal, ever young,\nIn maiden gladness fostering evermore\nA soft content of soul!\nBut ah, I shudder at thine anguish sore—\nThy doom thro’ years that roll!\nThou could’st not cower to Zeus: a love too great\nThou unto man hast given—\nToo high of heart thou wert—ah, thankless fate!\nWhat aid, ’gainst wrath of Heaven,\nCould mortal man afford? in vain thy gift\nTo things so powerless!\nCould’st thou not see? they are as dreams that drift;\nTheir strength is feebleness\nA purblind race, in hopeless fetters bound,\nThey have no craft or skill,\nThat could o’erreach the ordinance profound\nof the eternal will.\nAlas, Prometheus! on thy woe condign\nI looked, and learned this lore;\nAnd a new strain floats to these lips of mine—\nNot the glad song of yore,\nWhen by the lustral wave I sang to see\nMy sister made thy bride,\nDecked with thy gifts, thy loved Hesione,\nAnd clasped unto thy side.\nEnter IO, horned like a cow.\nIO.\nAlack! what land, what folk are here?\nWhom see I clenched in rocky fetters drear\nUnto the stormy crag? for what thing done\nDost thou in agony atone?\nAh, tell me whither, well-a-day!\nMy feet have roamed their weary way?\nAh, but it maddens, the sting! it burns in my piteous side!\nAh, but the vision, the spectre, the earth-born, the myriad-eyed!\nAvoid thee! Earth, hide him, thine offspring! he cometh—O aspect of ill!\nGhostly, and crafty of face, and dead, but pursuing me still!\nAh, woe upon me, woe ineffable!\nHe steals upon my track, a hound of hell—\nWhere’er I stray, along the sands and brine,\nWeary and foodless, come his creeping eyne!\nAnd ah, the ghostly sound—\nThe wax-stopped reed-flute’s weird and drowsy drone!\nAlack my wandering woes, that round and round\nLead me in many mazes, lost, foredone!\nO child of Cronos! for what deed of wrong\nAm I enthralled by thee in penance long?\nWhy by the stinging bruise, the thing of fear,\nDost thou torment me, heart and brain?\nNay, give me rather to the flames that sear,\nOr to some hidden grave,\nOr to the rending jaws, the monsters of the main!\nNor grudge the boon for which I crave, O king!\nEnough, enough of weary wandering,\nPangs from which none can save!\nHearken! in pity hold\nIo, the ox-horned maid, thy love of old!\nPROMETHEUS.\nHear Zeus or not, I hear and know thee well,\nDaughter of Inachus; I know thee driven,\nStung by the gadfly, mazed with agony.\nAy, thou art she whose beauty fired the breast\nOf Zeus with passion; she whom Hera’s hate\nNow harasses o’er leagues and leagues of land.\nIO.\nAlack, thou namest Inachus my sire!\nWottest thou of him? how, from lips of pain,\nComes to my woeful ears truth’s very strain?\nHow knowest thou the curse, the burning fire\nThe god-sent, piercing pest that stings and clings?\nAh me! in frenzied, foodless wanderings\nHither I come, and on me from on high\nLies Hera’s angry craft! Ah, men unblest!\nNot one there is, not one, that is unblest as I.\nBut thou—tell me the rest!\nUtter the rede of woes to come for me;\nUtter the aid, the cure, if aid or cure there be!\nPROMETHEUS.\nLo, clearly will I show forth all thy quest—\nNot in dark speech, but with such simple phrase\nAs doth befit the utterance of a friend.\nI am Prometheus, who gave fire to men.\nIO.\nO daring, proven champion of man’s race,\nWhat sin, Prometheus, dost thou thus atone?\nPROMETHEUS.\nOne moment since, I told my woes and ceased.\nIO.\nThen should I plead my suit to thee in vain?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNay, speak thy need; nought would I hide from thee.\nIO.\nPronounce who nailed thee to the rocky cleft.\nPROMETHEUS.\nZeus, by intent; Hephaestus, by his hand.\nIO.\nFor what wrongdoing do these pains atone?\nPROMETHEUS.\nWhat I have said, is said; suffice it thee!\nIO.\nYet somewhat add; forewarn me in my woe\nWhat time shall bring my wandering to its goal?\nPROMETHEUS.\nFore-knowledge is fore-sorrow; ask it not.\nIO.\nNay, hide not from me destiny’s decree.\nPROMETHEUS.\nI grudge thee not the gift which I withhold.\nIO.\nThen wherefore tarry ere thou tell me all?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNothing I grudge, but would not rack thy soul.\nIO.\nBe not compassionate beyond my wish.\nPROMETHEUS.\nWell, thou art fain, and I will speak. Attend!\nCHORUS.\nNay—ere thou speak, hear me, bestow on me\nA portion of the grace of granted prayers.\nFirst let us learn how Io’s frenzy came—\n(She telling her disasters manifold)\nThen of their sequel let her know from thee.\nPROMETHEUS.\nWell were it, Io, thus to do their will—\nRight well! they are the sisters of thy sire.\n’Tis worth the waste and effluence of time,\nTo tell, with tears of perfect moan, the doom\nOf sorrows that have fallen, when ’tis sure\nThe listeners will greet the tale with tears.\nIO.\nI know not how I should mistrust your prayer;\nTherefore the whole that ye desire of me\nYe now shall learn in one straightforward tale.\nYet, as it leaves my lips, I blush with shame\nTo tell that tempest of the spite of Heaven,\nAnd all the wreck and ruin of my form,\nAnd whence they swooped upon me, woe is me!\nLong, long in visions of the night there came\nVoices and forms into my maiden bower,\nAlluring me with smoothly glozing words—\nO maiden highly favoured of high Heaven,\nWhy cherish thy virginity so long?\nThine is it to win wedlock’s noblest crown!\nKnow that Zeus’ heart thro’ thee is all aflame,\nPierced with desire as with a dart, and longs\nTo join in utmost rite of love with thee.\nTherefore, O maiden, shun not with disdain\nTh’ embrace of Zeus, but hie thee forth straightway\nTo the lush growth of Lerna’s meadow-land,\nWhere are the flocks and steadings of thy home,\nAnd let Zeus’ eye be eased of its desire.\nNight after night, haunted by dreams like these,\nHeartsick, I ventured at the last to tell\nUnto my sire these visions of the dark.\nThen sent he many a wight, on sacred quest,\nTo Delphi and to far Dodona’s shrine,\nBeing fall fain to learn what deed or word\nWould win him favour from the powers of heaven.\nBut they came back repeating oracles\nMystic, ambiguous, inscrutable,\nTill, at the last, an utterance direct,\nObscure no more, was brought to Inachus—\nA peremptory charge to fling me forth\nBeyond my home and fatherland, a thing\nSent loose in banishment o’er all the world;\nAnd—should he falter—Zeus should launch on him\nA fire-eyed bolt, to shatter and consume\nHimself and all his race to nothingness.\nBowing before such utterance from the shrine\nOf Loxias, he drave me from our halls,\nBarring the gates against me: loth he was\nTo do, as I to suffer, this despite:\nBut the strong curb of Zeus had overborne\nHis will to me-ward. As I parted thence,\nIn form and mind I grew dishumanized,\nAnd horned as now ye see me, poison-stung\nBy the envenomed bitings of the brize,\nI leapt and flung in frenzy, rushed away\nTo the bright waters of Cerchneia’s stream\nAnd Lerna’s beach: but ever at my side,\nA herdsman by his heifer, Argus moved,\nEarth-born, malevolent of mood, and peered,\nWith myriad eyes, where’er my feet would roam.\nBut on him in a moment, unforeseen,\nCame Fate, and sundered him from life; but I,\nStill maddened by the gadfly’s sting, the scourge\nOf God’s infliction, roam the weary world.\nHow I have fared, thou hearest: be there aught\nOf what remains to bear, that thou canst tell,\nSpeak on! but let not thy compassion warm\nThy words to cheering falsehood. Worst of woes\nAre words that break their promise to our hope!\nCHORUS.\nWoe! woe! avaunt—thou and thy tale of bane!\nO never, never dared I dream\nSuch horror of strange sounds should pierce mine ear;\nSuch loathly sights, such tortures hard to bear,\nOutrage, pollution, agony supreme,\nWasting my heart with double edge of pain!\nAh Fate, ah Fate! I gaze on Io’s dole,\nAnd shudder to my soul!\nPROMETHEUS.\nThou wailest all too soon, fulfilled of fear—\nTarry awhile, till thou have learned the whole.\nCHORUS.\nSay on, reveal it! suffering souls are fain\nTo know aright what yet remains to bear.\nPROMETHEUS.\nLightly, with help of mine, did ye achieve\nThat which ye first desired: from Io’s mouth\ncraved to hear, recounted by herself,\nThe story of her strivings. Listen now\nTo what shall follow, to what woefulness\nThe wrath of Hera must compel this maid.\n(To Io)\nAnd thou, O child of Inachus, within\nThine inmost heart store up these words of mine,\nThat thou may’st learn thy wanderings and their goal.\nFirst from this spot toward the sunrise turn,\nAnd cross the steppe that knoweth not the plough:\nThus to the nomad Scythians shalt thou come,\nWho dwell in wattled homes, not built on earth\nBut borne along on wains of sturdy wheel—\nEquipped, themselves, with bows of mighty reach.\nPass them avoidingly, and leave their land,\nAnd skirt the beaches where the tides make moan,\nTill lo! upon the left hand thou shalt find\nThe Chalybes, stout craftsmen of the steel—\nBeware of them! no gentleness is theirs,\nNo kindly welcome to a stranger’s foot!\nThence to the Stream of Violence shalt thou come—\nLike name, like nature; see thou cross it not,\n(’Tis fatal to the forder!) till thou come\nRight to the very Caucasus, the peak\nThat overtops the world, and from its brows\nThe river pants in spray its wrathful stream.\nThence, o’er the pinnacles that court the stars,\nOnward and southward thou must take thy way,\nAnd reach the warlike horde of Amazons,\nMaidens through hate of man; and gladly they\nWill guide thy maiden feet. That host, in days\nThat are not yet, shall fix their home and dwell\nAt Themiscyra, on Thermodon’s bank,\nNigh whereunto the grim projecting fang\nOf Salmydessus’ cape affronts the main,\nThe seaman’s curse, to ships a stepmother!\nThen at the jutting land, Cimmerian styled,\nThat screens the narrowing portal of the mere,\nThou shalt arrive; pass o’er it, brave at heart,\nAnd ferry thee across Macotis’ ford.\nSo shall there be great rumour evermore,\nIn ears of mortals, of thy passage strange;\nAnd Bosporos shall be that channel’s name,\nBecause the ox-horned thing did pass thereby.\nSo, from the wilds of Europe wander’d o’er,\nTo Asia’s continent thou com’st at last.\n(To the CHORUS)\nAnd ye, what think ye? Seems he not, that lord\nAnd tyrant of the gods, as tyrannous\nUnto all other lives? A high god’s lust\nConstrained this mortal maid to roam the world!\n(To Io)\nPoor maid! a brutal wooer sure was thine!\nFor know that all which I have told thee now\nIs scarce the prelude of thy woes to come.\nIO.\nAlas for me, alas!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAgain thou criest, with a heifer’s low.\nWhat wilt thou do, learning thy future woes?\nCHORUS.\nWhat, hast thou further sorrows for her ear?\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea, a vext ocean of predestined pain.\nIO.\nWhat profit then is life to me? Ah, why\nDid I not cast me from this stubborn crag?\nSo with one spring, one crash upon the ground,\nI had attained surcease from all my woes.\nBetter it is to die one death outright\nThan linger out long life in misery.\nPROMETHEUS.\nIll would’st thou bear these agonies of mine—\nMine, with whose fate it standeth not to win\nThe goal of death, which were release from pain!\nNow, there is set no limit to my woe\nTill Zeus be hurled from his omnipotence.\nIO.\nZeus hurled from pride of place! Can such things be?\nPROMETHEUS.\nThou wert full fain, methinks, to see that sight!\nIO.\nEven so—his overthrow who wrought my pain.\nPROMETHEUS.\nThen may’st thou know thereof; such fall shall be.\nIO.\nAnd who shall wrench the sceptre from his hand?\nPROMETHEUS.\nBy his own mindless counsels shall he fall.\nIO.\nAnd how? unless the telling harm, say on!\nPROMETHEUS.\nWooing a bride, his ruin he shall win.\nIO.\nGoddess, or mortal? tell me, if thou may’st.\nPROMETHEUS.\nNo matter which—more must not be revealed.\nIO.\nDoth then a consort thrust him from his throne?\nPROMETHEUS.\nThe child she bears him shall o’ercome his sire.\nIO.\nAnd hath he no avoidance of this doom?\nPROMETHEUS.\nNone, surely—till that I, released from bonds—\nIO.\nWho can release thee, but by will of Zeus?\nPROMETHEUS.\nFate gives this duty to a child of thine!\nIO.\nHow? Shall a child of mine undo thy woes?\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea, of thy lineage, thirteen times removed.\nIO.\nDark beyond guessing grows thine oracle.\nPROMETHEUS.\nYea—seek not therefore to foreknow thy woes.\nIO.\nAs thou didst proffer hope, withdraw it not.\nPROMETHEUS.\nTwo tales I have—choose! for I grant thee one.\nIO.\nAnd which be they? reveal, and leave me choice.\nPROMETHEUS.\nI grant it: shall I in all clearness show\nThy future woes, or my deliverance?\nCHORUS.\nNay! of the two, vouchsafe her wish to her\nAnd mine to me, deigning a truth to each—\nTo her, reveal her future wanderings—\nTo me, thy future saviour, as I crave!\nPROMETHEUS.\nI will not set myself to thwart your will\nWithholding aught of what ye crave to know.\nFirst to thee, Io, will I tell and trace\nThy scared circuitous wandering mark it well,\nDeep in retentive tablets of the soul.\nWhen thou hast overpast the ferry’s flow\nThat sunders continent from continent,\nStraight to the eastward and the flaming face\nOf dawn, and highways trodden by the sun,\nPass, till thou come unto the windy land\nOf daughters born to Boreas: beware\nLest the strong spirit of the stormy blast\nSnatch thee aloft, and sweep thee to the void,\nOn wings of raving wintry hurricane!\nWend by the noisy tumult of the wave,\nUntil thou reach the Gorgon-haunted plains\nBeside Cisthene. In that solitude\nDwell Phorcys’ daughters, beldames worn with time,\nThree, each swan-shapen, single-toothed, and all\nPeering thro’ shared endowment of one eye;\nNever on them doth the sun shed his rays,\nNever falls radiance of the midnight moon.\nBut, hard by these, their sisters, clad with wings,\nSerpentine-curled, dwell, loathed of mortal men,—\nThe Gorgons!—he of men who looks on them\nShall gasp away his life. Of such fell guard\nI bid thee to beware. Now, mark my words\nWhen I another sight of terror tell—\nBeware the Gryphon pack, the hounds of Zeus,\nAs keen of fang as silent of their tongues!\nBeware the one-eyed Arimaspian band\nThat tramp on horse-hoofs, dwelling by the ford\nOf Pluto and the stream that flows with gold:\nKeep thou aloof from these. To the world’s end\nThou comest at the last, the dark-faced tribe\nThat dwell beside the sources of the sun,\nWhere springs the river, Aethiopian named.\nMake thou thy way along his bank, until\nThou come unto the mighty downward slope\nWhere from the overland of Bybline hills\nNile pours his hallowed earth-refreshing wave.\nHe by his course shall guide thee to the realm\nNamed from himself, three-angled, water-girt;\nThere, Io, at the last, hath Fate ordained,\nFor thee and for thy race, the charge to found,\nFar from thy native shore, a new abode.\nLo, I have said: if aught hereof appear\nHard to thy sense and inarticulate,\nQuestion me o’er again, and soothly learn—\nGod wot, I have too much of leisure here!\nCHORUS.\nIf there be aught beyond, or aught pass’d o’er,\nWhich thou canst utter, of her woe-worn maze,\nSpeak on! if all is said, then grant to us\nThat which we asked, as thou rememberest.\nPROMETHEUS.\nShe now hath learned, unto its utmost end,\nHer pilgrimage; but yet, that she may know\nThat ’tis no futile fable she hath heard,\nI will recount her history of toil\nEre she came hither; let it stand for proof\nOf what I told, my forecast of the end.\nSo, then—to sum in brief the weary tale—\nI turn me to thine earlier exile’s close.\nWhen to Molossia’s lowland thou hadst come,\nNigh to Dodona’s cliff and ridge sublime,\n(Where is the shrine oracular and seat\nOf Zeus, Thesprotian styled, and that strange thing\nAnd marvel past belief, the prophet-oaks\nThat syllable his speech), thou by their tongues,\nWith clear acclaim and unequivocal,\nWert thus saluted—Hail, O bride of Zeus\nThat art to be—hast memory thereof?\nThence, stung anew with frenzy, thou didst hie\nAlong the shoreward track, to Rhea’s lap,\nThe mighty main; then, stormily distraught,\nBackward again and eastward. To all time,\nBe well assured, that inlet of the sea\nAll mortal men shall call Ionian,\nIn memory that Io fared thereby.\nTake this for proof and witness that my mind\nHath more in ken than ever sense hath shown.\n(To the CHORUS)\nThat which remains, to you and her alike\nI will relate, and, to my former words\nReverting, add this final prophecy.\n(To Io)\nThere lieth, at the verge of land and sea,\nWhere Nilus issues thro’ the silted sand,\nA town, Canopus called: and there at length\nShall Zeus renew the reason in thy brain\nWith the mere touch and contact of his hand\nFraught now with fear no more: and thou shalt bear\nA child, dark Epaphus—his very name\nMemorial of Zeus’ touch that gave him life.\nAnd his shall be the foison and the fruit\nOf all the land enriched by spreading Nile.\nThence the fifth generation of his seed\nBack unto Argos, yet unwillingly,\nShall flee for refuge—fifty maidens they,\nLoathing a wedlock with their next in blood,\nMore kin than kind, from their sire’s brother sprung.\nAnd on their track, astir with wild desire,\nLike falcons fierce closing on doves that flee,\nShall speed the suitors, craving to achieve\nA prey forbidden, a reluctant bride.\nYet power divine shall foil them, and forbid\nPossession of the maids, whom Argive land\nShall hold protected, when unsleeping hate,\nHorror, and watchful ambush of the night,\nHave laid the suitors dead, by female hands.\nFor every maid shall smite a man to death,\nDyeing a dagger’s edges in his throat—\nSuch bed of love befall mine enemies!\nYet in one bride shall yearning conquer hate,\nBidding her spare the bridegroom at her side,\nBlunting the keen edge of her set resolve.\nThus of two scorns the former shall she choose,\nThe name of coward, not of murderess.\nIn Argos shall she bear, in after time,\nA royal offspring. Long it were to tell\nIn clear succession all that thence shall be.\nTake this for sooth—in lineage from her\nA hero shall arise, an archer great,\nAnd he shall be my saviour from these woes.\nSuch knowledge of the future Themis gave,\nThe ancient Titaness, to me her son.\nBut how, and by what skill, ’twere long to say,\nAnd no whit will the knowledge profit thee.\nIO.\nO woe, O rending and convulsive pain,\nFrenzy and agony, again, again\nSearing my heart and brain!\nO dagger of the sting, unforged with fire\nYet burning, burning ever! O my heart,\nPulsing with horror, beating at my breast!\nO rolling maddened eyes! away, apart,\nRaving with anguish dire,\nI spring, by frenzy-fiends possest.\nO wild and whirling words, that sweep in gloom\nDown to dark waves of doom!\n[Exit IO.]\nCHORUS.\nO well and sagely was it said—\nYea, wise of heart was he who first\nGave forth in speech the thought he nursed—\nIn thine own order see thou wed!\nLet not the humble heart aspire\nTo the gross home of wealth and pride;\nNor be it to a hearth allied\nThat vaunts of many a noble sire.\nO Fates, of awful empery!\nNever may I by Zeus be wooed—\nNever give o’er my maidenhood\nTo any god that dwells on high.\nA shudder to my soul is sent,\nBeholding Io’s doom forlorn—\nBy Hera’s malice put to scorn,\nRoaming in mateless banishment.\nFrom wedlock’s crown of fair desire\nI would not shrink—an idle fear!\nBut may no god to me draw near\nWith shunless might and glance of fire!\nThat were a strife wherein no chance\nOf conquest lies: from Zeus most high\nAnd his resolve, no subtlety\nCould win me my deliverance.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAnd yet shall Zeus, for all his stubborn pride,\nBe brought to low estate! aha, he schemes\nSuch wedlock as shall bring his doom on him,\nFlung from his kingship to oblivion’s lap!\nAy, then the curse his father Cronos spake\nAs he fell helpless from his agelong throne,\nShall be fulfilled unto the utterance!\nNo god but I can manifest to him\nA rescue from such ruin as impends—\nI know it, I, and how it may be foiled.\nGo to, then, let him sit and blindly trust\nHis skyey rumblings, for security,\nAnd wave his levin with its blast of flame!\nAll will avail him not, nor bar his fall\nDown to dishonour vile, intolerable\nSo strong a wrestler is he moulding now\nTo his own proper downfall—yea, a shape\nPortentous and unconquerably huge,\nWho truly shall reveal a flame more strong\nThan is the lightning, and a crash of sound\nMore loud than thunder, and shall dash to nought\nPoseidon’s trident-spear, the ocean-bane\nThat makes the firm earth quiver. Let Zeus strike\nOnce on this rock, he speedily shall learn\nHow far the fall from power to slavery!\nCHORUS.\nBeware! thy wish doth challenge Zeus himself.\nPROMETHEUS.\nI voice my wish and its fulfilment too.\nCHORUS.\nWhat, dare we look for one to conquer Zeus?\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy—Zeus shall wear more painful bonds than mine\nCHORUS.\nDarest thou speak such taunts and tremble not?\nPROMETHEUS.\nWhy should I fear, who am immortal too?\nCHORUS.\nYet he might doom thee to worse agony.\nPROMETHEUS.\nOut on his dooming! I foreknow it all.\nCHORUS.\nYet do the wise revere Necessity.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy, ay—do reverence, cringe and crouch to power\nWhene’er, where’er thou see it! But, for me,\nI reck of Zeus as something less than nought.\nLet him put forth his power, attest his sway,\nHowe’er he will—a momentary show,\nA little brief authority in heaven!\nAha, I see out yonder one who comes,\nA bidden courier, truckling at Zeus’ nod,\nA lacquey in his new lord’s livery,\nSurely on some fantastic errand sped!\nEnter HERMES.\nHERMES.\nThou, double-dyed in gall of bitterness,\nTrickster and sinner against gods, by giving\nThe stolen fire to perishable men!\nAttend—the Sire supreme doth bid thee tell\nWhat is the wedlock which thou vauntest now,\nWhereby he falleth from supremacy?\nSpeak forth the whole, make all thine utterance clear,\nHave done with words inscrutable, nor cause\nTo me, Prometheus! any further toil\nOr twofold journeying. Go to—thou seest\nZeus doth not soften at such words as thine!\nPROMETHEUS.\nPompous, in sooth, thy word, and swoln with pride,\nAs doth befit the lacquey of thy lords!\nO ye young gods! how, in your youthful sway,\nYe deem secure your citadels of sky,\nBeyond the reach of sorrow or of fall!\nHave I not seen two dynasties of gods\nAlready flung therefrom? and soon shall see\nA third, that now in tyranny exults,\nShamed, ruined, in an hour! What sayest thou?\nCrouch I and tremble at these stripling powers?\nSmall homage unto such from me, or none!\nBetake thee hence, sweat back along thy road—\nLook for no answer from me, get thee gone!\nHERMES.\nThink—it was such audacities of will\nThat drove thee erst to anchorage in woe!\nPROMETHEUS.\nAy—but mark this: mine heritage of pain\nI would not barter for thy servitude.\nHERMES.\nBetter, forsooth, be bond-slave to a crag,\nThan true-born herald unto Zeus the Sire!\nPROMETHEUS.\nTake thine own coin—taunts for a taunting slave!\nHERMES.\nProud art thou in thy circumstance, methinks!\nPROMETHEUS.\nProud? in such pride then be my foemen set,\nAnd I to see—and of such foes art thou!\nHERMES.\nWhat, blam’st thou me too for thy sufferings?\nPROMETHEUS.\nMark a plain word—I loathe all gods that are,\nWho reaped my kindness and repay with wrong.\nHERMES.\nI hear no little madness in thy words.\nPROMETHEUS.\nMadness be mine, if scorn of foes be mad.\nHERMES.\nPast bearing were thy pride, in happiness.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAh me!\nHERMES.\nZeus knoweth nought of sorrow’s cry!\nPROMETHEUS.\nHe shall!

Bethink thee now—\nIf these my words thou shouldest disregard—\nWhat storm, what might as of a great third wave\nShall dash thy doom upon thee, past escape!\nFirst shall the Sire, with thunder and the flame\nOf lightning, rend the crags of this ravine,\nAnd in the shattered mass o’erwhelm thy form,\nImmured and morticed in a clasping rock.\nThence, after age on age of durance done,\nBack to the daylight shall thou come, and there\nThe eagle-hound of Zeus, red-ravening, fell\nWith greed, shall tatter piecemeal all thy flesh\nTo shreds and ragged vestiges of form—\nYea, an unbidden guest, a day-long bane,\nThat feeds, and feeds—yea, he shall gorge his fill\nOn blackened fragments, from thy vitals gnawed.\nLook for no respite from that agony\nUntil some other deity be found,\nReady to bear for thee the brunt of doom,\nChoosing to pass into the lampless world\nOf Hades and the murky depths of hell.\nHereat, advise thee! ’tis no feigned threat\nWhereof I warn thee, but an o’er-true tale.\nThe lips of Zeus know nought of lying speech,\nBut wreak in action all their words foretell.\nTherefore do thou look warily, and deem\nPrudence a better saviour than self-will.\nCHORUS.\nMeseems that Hermes speaketh not amiss,\nBidding thee leave thy wilfulness and seek\nThe wary walking of a counselled mind.\nGive heed! to err through anger shames the wise.\nPROMETHEUS.\nAll, all I knew, whate’er his tongue\nIn idle arrogance hath flung.\n’Tis the world’s way, the common lot—\nFoe tortures foe and pities not.\nTherefore I challenge him to dash\nHis bolt on me, his zigzag flash\nOf piercing, rending flame!\nNow be the welkin stirred amain\nWith thunder-peal and hurricane,\nAnd let the wild winds now displace\nFrom its firm poise and rooted base\nThe stubborn earthly frame!\nThe raging sea with stormy surge\nRise up and ravin and submerge\nEach high star-trodden way!\nMe let him lift and dash to gloom\nOf nether hell, in whirls of doom!\nYet—do he what extremes he may—\nHe cannot crush my life away!\nHERMES.\nSuch are the counsels, such the strain,\nHeard from wild lips and frenzied brain!\nIn word or thought, how fails his fate\nOf madness wild and desperate?\n(To the CHORUS)\nBut ye, who stand compassionate\nHere at his side, depart in haste!\nLest of his penalty ye taste,\nAnd shattered brain and reason feel\nThe roaring, ruthless thunder-peal!\nCHORUS.\nOut on thee! if thy heart be fain\nI should obey thee, change thy strain!\nVile is thine hinted cowardice,\nAnd loathed of me thy base advice,\nWeakly to shrink from pain!\nNay, at his side, whate’er befall,\nI will abide, endure it all!\nAmong all things abhorr’d, accurst,\nI hold betrayers for the worst!\nHERMES.\nNay, ye are warned! remember well—\nNor cry, when meshed in nets of hell,\nAh cruel fate, ah Zeus unkind—\nThus, by a sentence undivined,\nTo dash us to the realms below!\nIt is no sudden, secret blow—\nNay, ye achieve your proper woe—\nWarn’d and foreknowing shall ye go,\nThrough your own folly trapped and ta’en,\nInto the net the Fates ordain—\nThe vast, illimitable pain!\n[Thunder and lightning.]\nPROMETHEUS.\nHark! for no more in empty word,\nBut in sheer sooth, the world is stirred!\nThe massy earth doth heave and sway,\nAnd thro’ their dark and secret way\nThe cavern’d thunders boom!\nSee, how they gleam athwart the sky,\nThe lightnings, through the gloom!\nAnd whirlwinds roll the dust on high,\nAnd right and left the storm-clouds leap\nTo battle in the skyey deep,\nIn wildest uproar unconfined,\nAn universe of warring wind!\nAnd falling sky and heaving sea\nAre blent in one! on me, on me,\nNearer and ever yet more near,\nFlaunting its pageantry of fear,\nDrives down in might its destined road\nThe tempest of the wrath of God!\nO holy Earth, O mother mine!\nO Sky, that biddest speed along\nThy vault the common Light divine,—\nBe witness of my wrong!\n[The rocks are rent with fire and earthquake, and fall, burying PROMETHEUS in the ruins.]",

    "content":"THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES\nARGUMENT\nLaius, king of the Cadmeans, was warned by the oracle of Delphi that he should not beget a child. But he disobeyed this command, and when a son was born to him, he cast the child away, that he might perish on Cithaeron. But a herdsman found the babe yet alive, and he was nourished in Corinth and grew to manhood, not knowing his true parentage, and was named Oedipus; and he slew, unknowingly, his father, Laius, and afterwards saved the town of the Cadmeans from a devouring monster, and married the widowed queen, Iocaste, and begat sons and daughters. But when he learned what he had wrought unwittingly, he fell into despair, and the queen slew herself. But before Oedipus died, he laid a curse upon his male children, Eteocles and Polynices, that they should make even division of the kingdom by the sword; and it fell out even so, for the two brothers strove together for the inheritance, and Polynices brought an army, from Argos, against Eteocles; and the brothers fought, and fell each by the other’s hand, and the curse was fulfilled.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nETEOCLES.\nA SPY.\nCHORUS OF CADMEAN MAIDENS.\nANTIGONE.\nISMENE.\nA HERALD.\nETEOCLES.\nClansmen of Cadmus, at the signal given\nBy time and season must the ruler speak\nWho sets the course and steers the ship of State\nWith hand upon the tiller, and with eye\nWatchful against the treachery of sleep.\nFor if all go aright, thank Heaven, men say,\nBut if adversely—which may God forefend!—\nOne name on many lips, from street to street,\nWould bear the bruit and rumour of the time,\nDown with Eteocles!—a clamorous curse,\nA dirge of ruin. May averting Zeus\nMake good his title here, in Cadmus’ hold!\nYou it beseems now boys unripened yet\nTo lusty manhood, men gone past the prime\nAnd increase of the full begetting seed,\nAnd those whom youth and manhood well combined\nArray for action—all to rise in aid\nOf city, shrines, and altars of all powers\nWho guard our land; that ne’er, to end of time,\nBe blotted out the sacred service due\nTo our sweet mother-land and to her brood.\nFor she it was who to their guest-right called\nYour waxing youth, was patient of the toil,\nAnd cherished you on the land’s gracious lap,\nAlike to plant the hearth and bear the shield\nIn loyal service, for an hour like this.\nMark now! until to-day, luck rules our scale;\nFor we, though long beleaguered, in the main\nHave with our sallies struck the foemen hard.\nBut now the seer, the feeder of the birds,\n(Whose art unerring and prophetic skill\nOf ear and mind divines their utterance\nWithout the lore of fire interpreted)\nForetelleth, by the mastery of his art,\nThat now an onset of Achaea’s host\nIs by a council of the night designed\nTo fall in double strength upon our walls.\nUp and away, then, to the battlements,\nThe gates, the bulwarks! don your panoplies,\nArray you at the breast-work, take your stand\nOn floorings of the towers, and with good heart\nStand firm for sudden sallies at the gates,\nNor hold too heinous a respect for hordes\nSent on you from afar: some god will guard!\nI too, for shrewd espial of their camp,\nHave sent forth scouts, and confidence is mine\nThey will not fail nor tremble at their task,\nAnd, with their news, I fear no foeman’s guile.\nEnter a SPY.\nTHE SPY.\nEteocles, high king of Cadmus’ folk,\nI stand here with news certified and sure\nFrom Argos’ camp, things by myself descried.\nSeven warriors yonder, doughty chiefs of might,\nInto the crimsoned concave of a shield\nHave shed a bull’s blood, and, with hands immersed\nInto the gore of sacrifice, have sworn\nBy Ares, lord of fight, and by thy name,\nBlood-lapping Terror, Let our oath be heard—\nEither to raze the walls, make void the hold\nOf Cadmus—strive his children as they may—\nOr, dying here, to make the foemen’s land\nWith blood impasted. Then, as memory’s gift\nUnto their parents at the far-off home,\nChaplets they hung upon Adrastus’ car,\nWith eyes tear-dropping, but no word of moan.\nFor their steeled spirit glowed with high resolve,\nAs lions pant, with battle in their eyes.\nFor them, no weak alarm delays the clear\nIssues of death or life! I parted thence\nEven as they cast the lots, how each should lead,\nAgainst which gate, his serried company.\nRank then thy bravest, with what speed thou may’st,\nHard by the gates, to dash on them, for now,\nFull-armed, the onward ranks of Argos come!\nThe dust whirls up, and from their panting steeds\nWhite foamy flakes like snow bedew the plain.\nThou therefore, chieftain! like a steersman skilled,\nEnshield the city’s bulwarks, ere the blast\nOf war comes darting on them! hark, the roar\nOf the great landstorm with its waves of men!\nTake Fortune by the forelock! for the rest,\nBy yonder dawn-light will I scan the field\nClear and aright, and surety of my word\nShall keep thee scatheless of the coming storm.\nETEOCLES.\nO Zeus and Earth and city-guarding gods,\nAnd thou, my father’s Curse, of baneful might,\nSpare ye at least this town, nor root it up,\nBy violence of the foemen, stock and stem!\nFor here, from home and hearth, rings Hellas’ tongue.\nForbid that e’er the yoke of slavery\nShould bow this land of freedom, Cadmus’ hold!\nBe ye her help! your cause I plead with mine—\nA city saved doth honour to her gods!\n[Exit ETEOCLES, etc.]\nEnter the CHORUS OF MAIDENS.\nCHORUS.\nI wail in the stress of my terror, and shrill is my cry of despair.\nThe foemen roll forth from their camp as a billow, and onward they bear!\nTheir horsemen are swift in the forefront, the dust rises up to the sky,\nA signal, though speechless, of doom, a herald more clear than a cry!\nHoof-trampled, the land of my love bears onward the din to mine ears.\nAs a torrent descending a mountain, it thunders and echoes and nears!\nThe doom is unloosened and cometh! O kings and O queens of high Heaven,\nPrevail that it fall not upon us: the sign for their onset is given—\nThey stream to the walls from without, white-shielded and keen for the fray.\nThey storm to the citadel gates— what god or what goddess can stay\nThe rush of their feet? to what shrine shall I bow me in terror and pray?\nO gods high-throned in bliss, we must crouch at the shrines in your home!\nNot here must we tarry and wail: shield clashes on shield as they come—\nAnd now, even now is the hour for the robes and the chaplets of prayer!\nMine eyes feel the flash of the sword, the clang is instinct with the spear!\nIs thy hand set against us, O Ares, in ruin and wrath to o’erwhelm\nThine own immemorial land, O god of the golden helm?\nLook down upon us, we beseech thee, on the land that thou lovest of old,\nAnd ye, O protecting gods, in pity your people behold!\nYea, save us, the maidenly troop, from the doom and despair of the slave,\nFor the crests of the foemen come onward, their rush is the rush of a wave\nRolled on by the war-god’s breath! almighty one, hear us and save\nFrom the grasp of the Argives’ might! to the ramparts of Cadmus they crowd,\nAnd, clenched in the teeth of the steeds, the bits clink horror aloud!\nAnd seven high chieftains of war, with spear and with panoply bold,\nAre set, by the law of the lot, to storm the seven gates of our hold!\nBe near and befriend us, O Pallas, the Zeus-born maiden of might!\nO lord of the steed and the sea, be thy trident uplifted to smite\nIn eager desire of the fray, Poseidon! and Ares come down,\nIn fatherly presence revealed, to rescue Harmonia’s town!\nThine too, Aphrodite, we are! thou art mother and queen of our race,\nTo thee we cry out in our need, from thee let thy children have grace!\nYe too, to scare back the foe, be your cry as a wolf’s howl wild,\nThou, O the wolf-lord, and thou, of she-wolf Leto the child!\nWoe and alack for the sound, for the rattle of cars to the wall,\nAnd the creak of the grinding axles! O Hera, to thee is our call!\nArtemis, maiden beloved! the air is distraught with the spears,\nAnd whither doth destiny drive us, and where is the goal of our fears?\nThe blast of the terrible stones on the ridge of our wall is not stayed,\nAt the gates is the brazen clash of the bucklers—Apollo to aid!\nThou too, O daughter of Zeus, who guidest the wavering fray\nTo the holy decision of fate, Athena! be with us to-day!\nCome down to the sevenfold gates and harry the foemen away!\nO gods and O sisters of gods, our bulwark and guard! we beseech\nThat ye give not our war-worn hold to a rabble of alien speech!\nList to the call of the maidens, the hands held up for the right,\nBe near us, protect us, and show that the city is dear in your sight!\nHave heed for her sacrifice holy, and thought of her offerings take,\nForget not her love and her worship, be near her and smite for her sake!\nRe-enter ETEOCLES.\nETEOCLES\nHark to my question, things detestable!\nIs this aright and for the city’s weal,\nAnd helpful to our army thus beset,\nThat ye before the statues of our gods\nShould fling yourselves, and scream and shriek your fears?\nImmodest, uncontrolled! Be this my lot—\nNever in troublous nor in peaceful days\nTo dwell with aught that wears a female form!\nWhere womankind has power, no man can house,\nWhere womankind feeds panic, ruin rules\nAlike in house and city! Look you now—\nYour flying feet, and rumour of your fears,\nHave spread a soulless panic on our walls,\nAnd they without do go from strength to strength,\nAnd we within make breach upon ourselves!\nSuch fate it brings, to house with womankind.\nTherefore if any shall resist my rule—\nOr man, or woman, or some sexless thing—\nThe vote of sentence shall decide their doom,\nAnd stones of execution, past escape,\nShall finish all. Let not a woman’s voice\nBe loud in council! for the things without,\nA man must care; let women keep within—\nEven then is mischief all too probable!\nHear ye? or speak I to unheeding ears?\nCHORUS.\nAh, but I shudder, child of Oedipus!\nI heard the clash and clang!\nThe axles rolled and rumbled; woe to us\nFire-welded bridles rang!\nETEOCLES.\nSay—when a ship is strained and deep in brine,\nDid e’er a seaman mend his chance, who left\nThe helm, t’invoke the image at the prow?\nCHORUS.\nAh, but I fled to the shrines, I called to our helpers on high,\nWhen the stone-shower roared at the portals!\nI sped to the temples aloft, and loud was my call and my cry,\nLook down and deliver. Immortals!\nETEOCLES.\nAy, pray amain that stone may vanquish steel!\nWere not that grace of gods? ay, ay—methinks,\nWhen cities fall, the gods go forth from them!\nCHORUS.\nAh, let me die, or ever I behold\nThe gods go forth, in conflagration dire!\nThe foemen’s rush and raid, and all our hold\nWrapt in the burning fire!\nETEOCLES.\nCry not: on Heaven, in impotent debate!\nWhat saith the saw?—Good saving Strength, in verity,\nOut of Obedience breeds the babe Prosperity.\nCHORUS.\n’Tis true: yet stronger is the power divine,\nAnd oft, when man’s estate is overbowed\nWith bitter pangs, disperses from his eyne\nThe heavy, hanging cloud!\nETEOCLES.\nLet men with sacrifice and augury\nApproach the gods, when comes the tug of war;\nMaids must be silent and abide within.\nCHORUS.\nBy grace of the gods we hold it, a city untamed of the spear,\nAnd the battlement wards from the wall the foe and his aspect of fear!\nWhat need of displeasure herein?\nETEOCLES.\nAy, pay thy vows to Heaven; I grudge them not,\nBut—so thou strike no fear into our men—\nHave calm at heart, nor be too much afraid.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, it is fresh in mine ears, the clamour and crash of the fray,\nAnd up to our holiest height I sped on my timorous way,\nBewildered, beset by the din!\nETEOCLES.\nNow, if ye hear the bruit of death or wounds,\nGive not yourselves o’ermuch to shriek and scream,\nFor Ares ravens upon human flesh.\nCHORUS.\nAh, but the snorting of the steeds I hear!\nETEOCLES.\nThen, if thou hearest, hear them not too well!\nCHORUS.\nHark, the earth rumbles, as they close us round!\nETEOCLES.\nEnough if I am here, with plans prepared.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, the battering at the gates is loud!\nETEOCLES.\nPeace! stay your tongue, or else the town may hear!\nCHORUS.\nO warders of the walls, betray them not!\nETEOCLES.\nBestrew your cries! in silence face your fate.\nCHORUS.\nGods of our city, see me not enslaved!\nETEOCLES.\nOn me, on all, thy cries bring slavery.\nCHORUS.\nZeus, strong to smite, turn upon foes thy blow!\nETEOCLES.\nZeus, what a curse are women, wrought by thee!\nCHORUS.\nWeak wretches, even as men, when cities fall.\nETEOCLES.\nWhat! clasping gods, yet voicing thy despair?\nCHORUS.\nIn the sick heart, fear machete prey of speech.\nETEOCLES.\nLight is the thing I ask thee—do my will!\nCHORUS.\nAsk swiftly: swiftly shall I know my power.\nETEOCLES.\nSilence, weak wretch! nor put thy friends in fear.\nCHORUS.\nI speak no more: the general fate be mine!\nETEOCLES.\nI take that word as wiser than the rest.\nNay, more: these images possess thy will—\nPray, in their strength, that Heaven be on our side!\nThen hear my prayers withal, and then ring out\nThe female triumph-note, thy privilege—\nYea, utter forth the usage Hellas knows,\nThe cry beside the altars, sounding clear\nEncouragement to friends, alarm to foes.\nBut I unto all gods that guard our walls,\nLords of the plain or warders of the mart\nAnd to Isthmus’ stream and Dirge’s rills,\nI swear, if Fortune smiles and saves our town,\nThat we will make our altars reek with blood\nOf sheep and kine, shed forth unto the gods,\nAnd with victorious tokens front our fannies—\nCorsets and cases that once our foemen wore,\nSpear-shattered now—to deck these holy homes!\nBe such thy vows to Heaven—away with sighs,\nAway with outcry vain and barbarous,\nThat shall avail not, in a general doom!\nBut I will back, and, with six chosen men\nMyself the seventh, to confront the foe\nIn this great aspect of a poisèd war,\nReturn and plant them at the sevenfold gates,\nOr e’er the prompt and clamorous battle-scouts\nHaste to inflame our counsel with the need.\n[Exit ETEOCLES.]\nCHORUS.\nI mark his words, yet, dark and deep,\nMy heart’s alarm forbiddeth sleep!\nClose-clinging cares around my soul\nEnkindle fears beyond control,\nPresageful of what doom may fall\nFrom the great leaguer of the wall!\nSo a poor dove is faint with fear\nFor her weak nestlings, while anew\nGlides on the snaky ravisher!\nIn troop and squadron, hand on hand,\nThey climb and throng, and hemmed we stand,\nWhile on the warders of our town\nThe flinty shower comes hurtling down!\nGods born of Zeus! put forth your might\nFor Cadmus’ city, realm, and right!\nWhat nobler land shall e’er be yours,\nIf once ye give to hostile powers\nThe deep rich soil, and Dirce’s wave,\nThe nursing stream, Poseidon gave\nAnd Tethys’ children? Up and save!\nCast on the ranks that hem us round\nA deadly panic, make them fling\nTheir arms in terror on the ground,\nAnd die in carnage! thence shall spring\nHigh honour for our clan and king!\nCome at our wailing cry, and stand\nAs thronèd sentries of our land!\nFor pity and sorrow it were that this immemorial town\nShould sink to be slave of the spear, to dust and to ashes gone down,\nBy the gods of Achaean worship and arms of Achaean might\nSacked and defiled and dishonoured, its women the prize of the fight—\nThat, haled by the hair as a steed, their mantles dishevelled and torn,\nThe maiden and matron alike should pass to the wedlock of scorn!\nI hear it arise from the city, the manifold wail of despair—\nWoe, woe for the doom that shall be—as in grasp of the foeman they fare!\nFor a woe and a weeping it is, if the maiden inviolate flower\nIs plucked by the foe in his might, not culled in the bridal bower!\nAlas for the hate and the horror—how say it?—less hateful by far\nIs the doom to be slain by the sword, hewn down in the carnage of war!\nFor wide, ah! wide is the woe when the foeman has mounted the wall;\nThere is havoc and terror and flame, and the dark smoke broods over all,\nAnd wild is the war-god’s breath, as in frenzy of conquest he springs,\nAnd pollutes with the blast of his lips the glory of holiest things!\nUp to the citadel rise clash and din,\nThe war-net closes in,\nThe spear is in the heart: with blood imbrued\nYoung mothers wail aloud,\nFor children at their breast who scream and die!\nAnd boys and maidens fly,\nYet scape not the pursuer, in his greed\nTo thrust and grasp and feed!\nRobber with robber joins, each calls his mate\nUnto the feast of hate—\nThe banquet, lo! is spread—\nseize, rend, and tear!\nNo need to choose or share!\nAnd all the wealth of earth to waste is poured—\nA sight by all abhorred!\nThe grieving housewives eye it;\nheaped and blent,\nEarth’s boons are spoiled and spent,\nAnd waste to nothingness; and O alas,\nYoung maids, forlorn ye pass—\nFresh horror at your hearts—beneath the power\nOf those who crop the flower!\nYe own the ruffian ravisher for lord,\nAnd night brings rites abhorred!\nWoe, woe for you! upon your grief and pain\nThere comes a fouler stain.\nEnter on one side THE SPY; on the other ETEOCLES and the SIX CHAMPIONS.\nSEMI-CHORUS.\nLook, friends! methinks the scout, who parted hence\nTo spy upon the foemen, comes with news,\nHis feet as swift as wafting chariot-wheels.\nSEMI-CHORUS.\nAy, and our king, the son of Oedipus,\nComes prompt to time, to learn the spy’s report—\nHis heart is fainter than his foot is fast!\nTHE SPY.\nWell have I scanned the foe, and well can say\nUnto which chief, by lot, each gate is given.\nTydeus already with his onset-cry\nStorms at the gate called Proetides; but him\nThe seer Amphiaraus holds at halt,\nNor wills that he should cross Ismenus’ ford,\nUntil the sacrifices promise fair.\nBut Tydeus, mad with lust of blood and broil,\nLike to a cockatrice at noontide hour,\nHisses out wrath and smites with scourge of tongue\nThe prophet-son of Oecleus—Wise thou art,\nFaint against war, and holding back from death!\nWith such revilings loud upon his lips\nHe waves the triple plumes that o’er his helm\nFloat overshadowing, as a courser’s mane;\nAnd at his shield’s rim, terror in their tone,\nClang and reverberate the brazen bells.\nAnd this proud sign, wrought on his shield, he bears—\nThe vault of heaven, inlaid with blazing stars;\nAnd, for the boss, the bright moon glows at full,\nThe eye of night, the first and lordliest star.\nThus with high-vaunted armour, madly bold,\nHe clamours by the stream-bank, wild for war,\nAs a steed panting grimly on his bit,\nHeld in and chafing for the trumpet’s bray!\nWhom wilt thou set against him? when the gates\nOf Proetus yield, who can his rush repel?\nETEOCLES.\nTo me, no blazon on a foeman’s shield\nShall e’er present a fear! such pointed threats\nAre powerless to wound; his plumes and bells,\nWithout a spear, are snakes without a sting.\nNay, more—that pageant of which thou tellest—\nThe nightly sky displayed, ablaze with stars,\nUpon his shield, palters with double sense—\nOne headstrong fool will find its truth anon!\nFor, if night fall upon his eyes in death,\nYon vaunting blazon will its own truth prove,\nAnd he is prophet of his folly’s fall.\nMine shall it be, to pit against his power\nThe loyal son of Astacus, as guard\nTo hold the gateways—a right valiant soul,\nWho has in heed the throne of Modesty\nAnd loathes the speech of Pride, and evermore\nShrinks from the base, but knows no other fear.\nHe springs by stock from those whom Ares spared,\nThe men called Sown, a right son of the soil,\nAnd Melanippus styled. Now, what his arm\nTo-day shall do, rests with the dice of war,\nAnd Ares shall ordain it; but his cause\nHath the true badge of Right, to urge him on\nTo guard, as son, his motherland from wrong.\nCHORUS.\nThen may the gods give fortune fair\nUnto our chief, sent forth to dare\nWar’s terrible arbitrament!\nBut ah! when champions wend away,\nI shudder, lest, from out the fray,\nOnly their blood-stained wrecks be sent!\nTHE SPY.\nNay, let him pass, and the gods’ help be his!\nNext, Capaneus comes on, by lot to lead\nThe onset at the gates Electran styled:\nA giant he, more huge than Tydeus’ self,\nAnd more than human in his arrogance—\nMay fate forefend his threat against our walls!\nGod willing, or unwilling—such his vaunt—\nI will lay waste this city; Pallas’ self,\nZeus’ warrior maid, although she swoop to earth\nAnd plant her in my path, shall stay me not.\nAnd, for the flashes of the levin-bolt,\nHe holds them harmless as the noontide rays.\nMark, too, the symbol on his shield—a man\nScornfully weaponless but torch in hand,\nAnd the flame glows within his grasp, prepared\nFor ravin: lo, the legend, wrought in words,\nFire for the city bring I, flares in gold!\nAgainst such wight, send forth—yet whom? what man\nWill front that vaunting figure and not fear?\nETEOCLES.\nAha, this profits also, gain on gain!\nIn sooth, for mortals, the tongue’s utterance\nBewrays unerringly a foolish pride!\nHither stalks Capaneus, with vaunt and threat\nDefying god-like powers, equipt to act,\nAnd, mortal though he be, he strains his tongue\nIn folly’s ecstasy, and casts aloft\nHigh swelling words against the ears of Zeus.\nRight well I trust—if justice grants the word—\nThat, by the might of Zeus, a bolt of flame\nIn more than semblance shall descend on him.\nAgainst his vaunts, though reckless, I have set,\nTo make assurance sure, a warrior stern—\nStrong Polyphontes, fervid for the fray;\nA sturdy bulwark, he, by grace of Heaven\nAnd favour of his champion Artemis!\nSay on, who holdeth the next gate in ward?\nCHORUS.\nPerish the wretch whose vaunt affronts our home!\nOn him the red bolt come,\nEre to the maiden bowers his way he cleave,\nTo ravage and bereave!\nTHE SPY.\nI will say on. Eteoclus is third—\nTo him it fell, what time the third lot sprang\nO’er the inverted helmet’s brazen rim,\nTo dash his stormers on Neistae gate.\nHe wheels his mares, who at their frontlets chafe\nAnd yearn to charge upon the gates amain.\nThey snort the breath of pride, and, filled therewith,\nTheir nozzles whistle with barbaric sound.\nHigh too and haughty is his shield’s device—\nAn armèd man who climbs, from rung to rung,\nA scaling ladder, up a hostile wall,\nAfire to sack and slay; and he too cries,\n(By letters, full of sound, upon the shield)\nNot Ares’ self shall cast me from the wall.\nLook to it, send, against this man, a man\nStrong to debar the slave’s yoke from our town.\nETEOCLES (pointing to MEGAREUS)\nSend will I—even this man, with luck to aid—\nBy his worth sent already, not by pride\nAnd vain pretence, is he. ’Tis Megareus,\nThe child of Creon, of the Earth-sprung born!\nHe will not shrink from guarding of the gates,\nNor fear the maddened charger’s frenzied neigh,\nBut, if he dies, will nobly quit the score\nFor nurture to the land that gave him birth,\nOr from the shield-side hew two warriors down\nEteoclus and the figure that he lifts—\nAy, and the city pictured, all in one,\nAnd deck with spoils the temple of his sire!\nAnnounce the next pair, stint not of thy tongue!\nCHORUS.\nO thou, the warder of my home,\nGrant, unto us, Fate’s favouring tide,\nSend on the foemen doom!\nThey fling forth taunts of frenzied pride,\nOn them may Zeus with glare of vengeance come;\nTHE SPY.\nLo, next him stands a fourth and shouts amain,\nBy Pallas Onca’s portal, and displays\nA different challenge; ’tis Hippomedon!\nHuge the device that starts up from his targe\nIn high relief; and, I deny it not,\nI shuddered, seeing how, upon the rim,\nIt made a mighty circle round the shield—\nNo sorry craftsman he, who wrought that work\nAnd clamped it all around the buckler’s edge!\nThe form was Typhon: from his glowing throat\nRolled lurid smoke, spark-litten, kin of fire!\nThe flattened edge-work, circling round the whole,\nMade strong support for coiling snakes that grew\nErect above the concave of the shield:\nLoud rang the warrior’s voice; inspired for war,\nHe raves to slay, as doth a Bacchanal,\nHis very glance a terror! of such wight\nBeware the onset! closing on the gates,\nHe peals his vaunting and appalling cry!\nETEOCLES.\nYet first our Pallas Onca—wardress she,\nPlanting her foot hard by her gate—shall stand,\nThe Maid against the ruffian, and repel\nHis force, as from her brood the mother-bird\nBeats back the wintered serpent’s venom’d fang\nAnd next, by her, is Oenops’ gallant son,\nHyperbius, chosen to confront this foe,\nReady to seek his fate at Fortune’s shrine!\nIn form, in valour, and in skill of arms,\nNone shall gainsay him. See how wisely well\nHermes hath set the brave against the strong!\nConfronted shall they stand, the shield of each\nBearing the image of opposing gods:\nOne holds aloft his Typhon breathing fire,\nBut, on the other’s shield, in symbol sits\nZeus, calm and strong, and fans his bolt to flame—\nZeus, seen of all, yet seen of none to fail!\nHowbeit, weak is trust reposed in Heaven—\nYet are we upon Zeus’ victorious side,\nThe foe, with those he worsted—if in sooth\nZeus against Typhon held the upper hand,\nAnd if Hyperbius, (as well may hap\nWhen two such foes such diverse emblems bear)\nHave Zeus upon his shield, a saving sign.\nCHORUS.\nHigh faith is mine that he whose shield\nBears, against Zeus, the thing of hate.\nThe giant Typhon, thus revealed,\nA monster loathed of gods eterne\nAnd mortal men—this doom shall earn\nA shattered skull, before the gate!\nTHE SPY.\nHeaven send it so!\nA fifth assailant now\nIs set against our fifth, the northern, gate,\nFronting the death-mound where Amphion lies\nThe child of Zeus.\nThis foeman vows his faith,\nUpon a mystic spear-head which he deems\nMore holy than a godhead and more sure\nTo find its mark than any glance of eye,\nThat, will they, nill they, he will storm and sack\nThe hold of the Cadmeans. Such his oath—\nHis, the bold warrior, yet of childish years,\nA bud of beauty’s foremost flower, the son\nOf Zeus and of the mountain maid. I mark\nHow the soft down is waxing on his cheek,\nThick and close-growing in its tender prime—\nIn name, not mood, is he a maiden’s child—\nParthenopaeus; large and bright his eyes\nBut fierce the wrath wherewith he fronts the gate:\nYet not unheralded he takes his stand\nBefore the portal; on his brazen shield,\nThe rounded screen and shelter of his form,\nI saw him show the ravening Sphinx, the fiend\nThat shamed our city—how it glared and moved,\nClamped on the buckler, wrought in high relief!\nAnd in its claws did a Cadmean bear—\nNor heretofore, for any single prey,\nSped she aloft, through such a storm of darts\nAs now awaits her. So our foe is here—\nLike, as I deem, to ply no stinted trade\nIn blood and broil, but traffick as is meet\nIn fierce exchange for his long wayfaring!\nETEOCLES.\nAh, may they meet the doom they think to bring—\nThey and their impious vaunts—from those on high!\nSo should they sink, hurled down to deepest death!\nThis foe, at least, by thee Arcadian styled,\nIs faced by one who bears no braggart sign,\nBut his hand sees to smite, where blows avail—\nActor, own brother to Hyperbius!\nHe will not let a boast without a blow\nStream through our gates and nourish our despair,\nNor give him way who on his hostile shield\nBears the brute image of the loathly Sphinx!\nBlocked at the gate, she will rebuke the man\nWho strives to thrust her forward, when she feels\nThick crash of blows, up to the city wall.\nWith Heaven’s goodwill, my forecast shall be true.\nCHORUS.\nHome to my heart the vaunting goes,\nAnd, quick with terror, on my head\nRises my hair, at sound of those\nWho wildly, impiously rave!\nIf gods there be, to them I plead—\nGive them to darkness and the grave.\nTHE SPY.\nFronting the sixth gate stands another foe,\nWisest of warriors, bravest among seers—\nSuch must I name Amphiaraus: he,\nSet steadfast at the Homoloid gate,\nBerates strong Tydeus with reviling words—\nThe man of blood, the bane of state and home,\nTo Argos, arch-allurer to all ill,\nEvoker of the fury-fiend of hell,\nDeath’s minister, and counsellor of wrong\nUnto Adrastus in this fatal field.\nAy, and with eyes upturned and mien of scorn\nHe chides thy brother Polynices too\nAt his desert, and once and yet again\nDwells hard and meaningly upon his name\nWhere it saith glory yet importeth feud.\nYea, such thou art in act, and such thy grace\nIn sight of Heaven, and such in aftertime\nThy fame, for lips and ears of mortal men!\n“He strove to sack the city of his sires\nAnd temples of her gods, and brought on her\nAn alien armament of foreign foes.\nThe fountain of maternal blood outpoured\nWhat power can staunch? even so, thy fatherland\nOnce by thine ardent malice stormed and ta’en,\nShall ne’er join force with thee.” For me, I know\nIt doth remain to let my blood enrich\nThe border of this land that loves me not—\nBlood of a prophet, in a foreign grave!\nNow, for the battle! I foreknow my doom,\nYet it shall be with honour. So he spake,\nThe prophet, holding up his targe of bronze\nWrought without blazon, to the ears of men\nWho stood around and heeded not his word.\nFor on no bruit and rumour of great deeds,\nBut on their doing, is his spirit set,\nAnd in his heart he reaps a furrow rich,\nWherefrom the foison of good counsel springs.\nAgainst him, send brave heart and hand of might,\nFor the god-lover is man’s fiercest foe.\nETEOCLES.\nOut on the chance that couples mortal men,\nLinking the just and impious in one!\nIn every issue, the one curse is this—\nCompanionship with men of evil heart!\nA baneful harvest, let none gather it!\nThe field of sin is rank, and brings forth death\nAt whiles a righteous man who goes aboard\nWith reckless mates, a horde of villainy,\nDies by one death with that detested crew;\nAt whiles the just man, joined with citizens\nRuthless to strangers, recking nought of Heaven,\nTrapped, against nature, in one net with them,\nDies by God’s thrust and all-including blow.\nSo will this prophet die, even Oecleus’ child,\nSage, just, and brave, and loyal towards Heaven,\nPotent in prophecy, but mated here\nWith men of sin, too boastful to be wise!\nLong is their road, and they return no more,\nAnd, at their taking-off, by hand of Zeus,\nThe prophet too shall take the downward way.\nHe will not—so I deem—assail the gate—\nNot as through cowardice or feeble will,\nBut as one knowing to what end shall be\nTheir struggle in the battle, if indeed\nFruit of fulfilment lie in Loxias’ word.\nHe speaketh not, unless to speak avails!\nYet, for more surety, we will post a man,\nStrong Lasthenes, as warder of the gate,\nStern to the foeman; he hath age’s skill,\nMated with youthful vigour, and an eye\nForward, alert; swift too his hand, to catch\nThe fenceless interval ’twixt shield and spear!\nYet man’s good fortune lies in hand of Heaven.\nCHORUS.\nUnto our loyal cry, ye gods, give ear!\nSave, save the city! turn away the spear,\nSend on the foemen fear!\nOutside the rampart fall they, rent and riven\nBeneath the bolt of heaven!\nTHE SPY.\nLast, let me name yon seventh antagonist,\nThy brother’s self, at the seventh portal set—\nHear with what wrath he imprecates our doom,\nVowing to mount the wall, though banished hence,\nAnd peal aloud the wild exulting cry—\nThe town is ta’en—then clash his sword with thine,\nGiving and taking death in close embrace,\nOr, if thou ’scapest, flinging upon thee,\nAs robber of his honour and his home,\nThe doom of exile such as he has borne.\nSo clamours he and so invokes the gods\nWho guard his race and home, to hear and heed\nThe curse that sounds in Polynices’ name!\nHe bears a round shield, fresh from forge and fire,\nAnd wrought upon it is a twofold sign—\nFor lo, a woman leads decorously\nThe figure of a warrior wrought in gold;\nAnd thus the legend runs—I Justice am,\nAnd I will bring the hero home again,\nTo hold once more his place within this town,\nOnce more to pace his sire’s ancestral hall.\nSuch are the symbols, by our foemen shown—\nNow make thine own decision, whom to send\nAgainst this last opponent! I have said—\nNor canst thou in my tidings find a flaw—\nThine is it, now, to steer the course aright.\nETEOCLES.\nAh me, the madman, and the curse of Heaven!\nAnd woe for us, the lamentable line\nOf Oedipus, and woe that in this house\nOur father’s curse must find accomplishment!\nBut now, a truce to tears and loud lament,\nLest they should breed a still more rueful wail!\nAs for this Polynices, named too well,\nSoon shall we know how his device shall end—\nWhether the gold-wrought symbols on his shield,\nIn their mad vaunting and bewildered pride,\nShall guide him as a victor to his home!\nFor had but Justice, maiden-child of Zeus,\nStood by his act and thought, it might have been!\nYet never, from the day he reached the light\nOut of the darkness of his mother’s womb,\nNever in childhood, nor in youthful prime,\nNor when his chin was gathering its beard,\nHath Justice hailed or claimed him as her own.\nTherefore I deem not that she standeth now\nTo aid him in this outrage on his home!\nMisnamed, in truth, were Justice, utterly,\nIf to impiety she lent her hand.\nSure in this faith, I will myself go forth\nAnd match me with him; who hath fairer claim?\nRuler, against one fain to snatch the rule,\nBrother with brother matched, and foe with foe,\nWill I confront the issue. To the wall!\nCHORUS.\nO thou true heart, O child of Oedipus,\nBe not, in wrath, too like the man whose name\nMurmurs an evil omen! ’Tis enough\nThat Cadmus’ clan should strive with Argos’ host,\nFor blood there is that can atone that stain!\nBut—brother upon brother dealing death—\nNot time itself can expiate the sin!\nETEOCLES.\nIf man find hurt, yet clasp his honour still,\n’Tis well; the dead have honour, nought beside.\nHurt, with dishonour, wins no word of praise!\nCHORUS.\nAh, what is thy desire?\nLet not the lust and ravin of the sword\nBear thee adown the tide accursed, abhorred!\nFling off thy passion’s rage, thy spirit’s prompting dire!\nETEOCLES.\nNay—since the god is urgent for our doom,\nLet Laius’ house, by Phoebus loathed and scorned,\nFollow the gale of destiny, and win\nIts great inheritance, the gulf of hell!\nCHORUS.\nRuthless thy craving is—\nCraving for kindred and forbidden blood\nTo be outpoured—a sacrifice imbrued\nWith sin, a bitter fruit of murderous enmities!\nETEOCLES.\nYea, my own father’s fateful Curse proclaims—\nA ghastly presence, and her eyes are dry—\nStrike! honour is the prize, not life prolonged!\nCHORUS.\nAh, be not urged of her! for none shall dare\nTo call thee coward, in thy throned estate!\nWill not the Fury in her sable pall\nPass outward from these halls, what time the gods\nWelcome a votive offering from our hands?\nETEOCLES.\nThe gods! long since they hold us in contempt,\nScornful of gifts thus offered by the lost!\nWhy should we fawn and flinch away from doom?\nCHORUS.\nNow, when it stands beside thee! for its power\nMay, with a changing gust of milder mood,\nTemper the blast that bloweth wild and rude\nAnd frenzied, in this hour!\nETEOCLES.\nAy, kindled by the curse of Oedipus—\nAll too prophetic, out of dreamland came\nThe vision, meting out our sire’s estate!\nCHORUS.\nHeed women’s voices, though thou love them not!\nETEOCLES.\nSay aught that may avail, but stint thy words.\nCHORUS.\nGo not thou forth to guard the seventh gate!\nETEOCLES.\nWords shall not blunt the edge of my resolve.\nCHORUS.\nYet the god loves to let the weak prevail.\nETEOCLES.\nThat to a swordsman, is no welcome word!\nCHORUS.\nShall thine own brother’s blood be victory’s palm?\nETEOCLES.\nIll which the gods have sent thou canst not shun!\n[Exit ETEOCLES.]\nCHORUS.\nI shudder in dread of the power, abhorred by the gods of high heaven,\nThe ruinous curse of the home till roof-tree and rafter be riven!\nToo true are the visions of ill, too true the fulfilment they bring\nTo the curse that was spoken of old by the frenzy and wrath of the king!\nHer will is the doom of the children, and Discord is kindled amain,\nAnd strange is the Lord of Division, who cleaveth the birthright in twain,—\nThe edged thing, born of the north, the steel that is ruthless and keen,\nDividing in bitter division the lot of the children of teen!\nNot the wide lowland around, the realm of their sire, shall they have,\nYet enough for the dead to inherit, the pitiful space of a grave!\nAh, but when kin meets kin, when sire and child,\nUnknowing, are defiled\nBy shedding common blood, and when the pit\nOf death devoureth it,\nDrinking the clotted stain, the gory dye—\nWho, who can purify?\nWho cleanse pollution, where the ancient bane\nRises and reeks again?\nWhilome in olden days the sin was wrought,\nAnd swift requital brought—\nYea on the children of the child came still\nNew heritage of ill!\nFor thrice Apollo spoke this word divine,\nFrom Delphi’s central shrine,\nTo Laius—Die thou childless! thus alone\nCan the land’s weal be won!\nBut vainly with his wife’s desire he strove,\nAnd gave himself to love,\nBegetting Oedipus, by whom he died,\nThe fateful parricide!\nThe sacred seed-plot, his own mother’s womb,\nHe sowed, his house’s doom,\nA root of blood! by frenzy lured, they came\nUnto their wedded shame.\nAnd now the waxing surge, the wave of fate,\nRolls on them, triply great—\nOne billow sinks, the next towers, high and dark,\nAbove our city’s bark—\nOnly the narrow barrier of the wall\nTotters, as soon to fall;\nAnd, if our chieftains in the storm go down,\nWhat chance can save the town?\nCurses, inherited from long ago,\nBring heavy freight of woe:\nRich stores of merchandise o’erload the deck,\nNear, nearer comes the wreck—\nAnd all is lost, cast out upon the wave,\nFloating, with none to save!\nWhom did the gods, whom did the chief of men,\nWhom did each citizen\nIn crowded concourse, in such honour hold,\nAs Oedipus of old,\nWhen the grim fiend, that fed on human prey,\nHe took from us away?\nBut when, in the fulness of days, he knew of his bridal unblest,\nA twofold horror he wrought, in the frenzied despair of his breast—\nDebarred from the grace of the banquet, the service of goblets of gold,\nHe flung on his children a curse for the splendour they dared to withhold,\nA curse prophetic and bitter—The glory of wealth and of pride,\nWith iron, not gold, in your hands, ye shall come, at the last, to divide!\nBehold, how a shudder runs through me, lest now, in the fulness of time,\nThe house-fiend awake and return, to mete out the measure of crime!\nEnter THE SPY.\nTHE SPY.\nTake heart, ye daughters whom your mothers’ milk\nMade milky-hearted! lo, our city stands,\nSaved from the yoke of servitude: the vaunts\nOf overweening men are silent now,\nAnd the State sails beneath a sky serene,\nNor in the manifold and battering waves\nHath shipped a single surge, and solid stands\nThe rampart, and the gates are made secure,\nEach with a single champion’s trusty guard.\nSo in the main and at six gates we hold\nA victory assured; but, at the seventh,\nThe god that on the seventh day was born,\nRoyal Apollo, hath ta’en up his rest\nTo wreak upon the sons of Oedipus\nTheir grandsire’s wilfulness of long ago.\nCHORUS.\nWhat further woefulness besets our home?\nTHE SPY.\nThe home stands safe—but ah, the princes twain—\nCHORUS.\nWho? what of them? I am distraught with fear.\nTHE SPY.\nHear now, and mark! the sons of Oedipus—\nCHORUS.\nAh, my prophetic soul! I feel their doom.\nTHE SPY.\nHave done with questions!—with their lives crushed out—\nCHORUS.\nLie they out yonder? the full horror speak!\nDid hands meet hands more close than brotherly?\nCame fate on each, and in the selfsame hour?\nTHE SPY.\nYea, blotting out the lineage ill-starred!\nNow mix your exultation and your tears,\nOver a city saved, the while its lords,\nTwin leaders of the fight, have parcelled out\nWith forged arbitrament of Scythian steel\nThe full division of their fatherland,\nAnd, as their father’s imprecation bade,\nShall have their due of land, a twofold grave.\nSo is the city saved; the earth has drunk\nBlood of twin princes, by each other slain.\nCHORUS.\nO mighty Zeus and guardian powers,\nThe strength and stay of Cadmus’ towers!\nShall I send forth a joyous cry,\nHail to the lord of weal renewed?\nOr weep the misbegotten twain,\nBorn to a fatal destiny?\nEach numbered now among the slain,\nEach dying in ill fortitude,\nEach truly named, each child of feud?\nO dark and all-prevailing ill,\nThat broods o’er Oedipus and all his line,\nNumbing my heart with mortal chill!\nAh me, this song of mine,\nWhich, Thyad-like, I woke, now falleth still,\nOr only tells of doom,\nAnd echoes round a tomb!\nDead are they, dead! in their own blood they lie—\nIll-omened the concent that hails our victory!\nThe curse a father on his children spake\nHath faltered not, nor failed!\nNought, Laius! thy stubborn choice availed—\nFirst to beget, then, in the after day\nAnd for the city’s sake,\nThe child to slay!\nFor nought can blunt nor mar\nThe speech oracular!\nChildren of teen! by disbelief ye erred—\nYet in wild weeping came fulfilment of the word!\nANTIGONE and ISMENE approach with a train of mourners, bearing the bodies of ETEOCLES and POLYNICES.\nLook up, look forth! the doom is plain,\nNor spake the messenger in vain!\nA twofold sorrow, twofold strife—\nEach brave against a brother’s life!\nIn double doom hath sorrow come—\nHow shall I speak it?—on the home!\nAlas, my sisters! be your sighs the gale,\nThe smiting of your brows the plash of oars,\nWafting the boat, to Acheron’s dim shores\nThat passeth ever, with its darkened sail,\nOn its uncharted voyage and sunless way,\nFar from thy beams, Apollo, god of day—\nThe melancholy bark\nBound for the common bourn, the harbour of the dark!\nLook up, look yonder! from the home\nAntigone, Ismene come,\nOn the last, saddest errand bound,\nTo chant a dirge of doleful sound,\nWith agony of equal pain\nAbove their brethren slain!\nTheir sister-bosoms surely swell,\nHeart with rent heart according well\nIn grief for those who fought and fell!\nYet—ere they utter forth their woe—\nWe must awake the rueful strain\nTo vengeful powers, in realms below,\nAnd mourn hell’s triumph o’er the slain!\nAlas! of all, the breast who bind,—\nYea, all the race of womankind—\nO maidens, ye are most bereaved!\nFor you, for you the tear-drops start—\nDeem that in truth, and undeceived,\nYe hear the sorrows of my heart!\n(To the dead.)\nChildren of bitterness, and sternly brave—\nOne, proud of heart against persuasion’s voice,\nOne, against exile proof!

    "content":"THE SUPPLIANT MAIDENS\nDEDICATION\nTake thou this gift from out the grave of Time.\nThe urns of Greece lie shattered, and the cup\nThat for Athenian lips the Muses filled,\nAnd flowery crowns that on Athenian hair\nHid the cicala, freedom’s golden sign,\nDust in the dust have fallen. Calmly sad,\nThe marble dead upon Athenian tombs\nSpeak from their eyes “Farewell”: and well have fared\nThey and the saddened friends, whose clasping hands\nWin from the solemn stone eternity.\nYea, well they fared unto the evening god,\nPassing beyond the limit of the world,\nWhere face to face the son his mother saw,\nA living man a shadow, while she spake\nWords that Odysseus and that Homer heard,—\nI too, O child, I reached the common doom,\nThe grave, the goal of fate, and passed away.\n—Such, Anticleia, as thy voice to him,\nAcross the dim gray gulf of death and time\nIs that of Greece, a mother’s to a child,—\nMother of each whose dreams are grave and fair—\nWho sees the Naiad where the streams are bright\nAnd in the sunny ripple of the sea\nCymodoce with floating golden hair:\nAnd in the whisper of the waving oak\nHears still the Dryad’s plaint, and, in the wind\nThat sighs through moonlit woodlands, knows the horn\nOf Artemis, and silver shafts and bow.\nTherefore if still around this broken vase,\nBorne by rough hands, unworthy of their load,\nFar from Cephisus and the wandering rills,\nThere cling a fragrance as of things once sweet,\nOf honey from Hymettus’ desert hill,\nTake thou the gift and hold it close and dear;\nFor gifts that die have living memories—\nVoices of unreturning days, that breathe\nThe spirit of a day that never dies.\nARGUMENT\nIo, the daughter of Inachus, King of Argos, was beloved of Zeus. But Hera was jealous of that love, and by her ill will was Io given over to frenzy, and her body took the semblance of a heifer: and Argus, a many-eyed herdsman, was set by Hera to watch Io whithersoever she strayed. Yet, in despite of Argus, did Zeus draw nigh unto her in the shape of a bull. And by the will of Zeus and the craft of Hermes was Argus slain. Then Io was driven over far lands and seas by her madness, and came at length to the land of Egypt. There was she restored to herself by a touch of the hand of Zeus, and bare a child called Epaphus. And from Epaphus sprang Libya, and from Libya, Belus; and from Belus, Aegyptus and Danaus. And the sons of Aegyptus willed to take the daughters of Danaus in marriage. But the maidens held such wedlock in horror, and fled with their father over the sea to Argos; and the king and citizens of Argos gave them shelter and protection from their pursuers.\nTHE SUPPLIANT MAIDENS\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nDANAUS.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nChorus of the Daughters of Danaus.\nAttendants.\nScene.—A sacred precinct near the gates of Argos: statue and shrines of Zeus and other deities stand around.\nCHORUS.\nZeus! Lord and guard of suppliant hands!\nLook down benign on us who crave\nThine aid—whom winds and waters drave\nFrom where, through drifting shifting sands,\nPours Nilus to the wave.\nFrom where the green land, god-possest,\nCloses and fronts the Syrian waste,\nWe flee as exiles, yet unbanned\nBy murder’s sentence from our land;\nBut—since Aegyptus had decreed\nHis sons should wed his brother’s seed,—\nOurselves we tore from bonds abhorred,\nFrom wedlock not of heart but hand,\nNor brooked to call a kinsman lord!\nAnd Danaus, our sire and guide,\nThe king of counsel, pond’ring well\nThe dice of fortune as they fell,\nOut of two griefs the kindlier chose,\nAnd bade us fly, with him beside,\nHeedless what winds or waves arose,\nAnd o’er the wide sea waters haste,\nUntil to Argos’ shore at last\nOur wandering pinnace came—\nArgos, the immemorial home\nOf her from whom we boast to come—\nIo, the ox-horned maiden, whom,\nAfter long wandering, woe, and scathe,\nZeus with a touch, a mystic breath,\nMade mother of our name.\nTherefore, of all the lands of earth,\nOn this most gladly step we forth,\nAnd in our hands aloft we bear—\nSole weapon for a suppliant’s wear—\nThe olive-shoot, with wool enwound!\nCity, and land, and waters wan\nOf Inachus, and gods most high,\nAnd ye who, deep beneath the ground,\nBring vengeance weird on mortal man,\nPowers of the grave, on you we cry!\nAnd unto Zeus the Saviour, guard\nOf mortals’ holy purity!\nReceive ye us—keep watch and ward\nAbove the suppliant maiden band!\nChaste be the heart of this your land\nTowards the weak! but, ere the throng,\nThe wanton swarm, from Egypt sprung,\nLeap forth upon the silted shore,\nThrust back their swift-rowed bark again,\nRepel them, urge them to the main!\nAnd there, ’mid storm and lightning’s shine,\nAnd scudding drift and thunder’s roar,\nDeep death be theirs, in stormy brine!\nBefore they foully grasp and win\nUs, maiden-children of their kin,\nAnd climb the couch by law denied,\nAnd wrong each weak reluctant bride.\nAnd now on her I call,\nMine ancestress, who far on Egypt’s shore\nA young cow’s semblance wore,—\nA maiden once, by Hera’s malice changed!\nAnd then on him withal,\nWho, as amid the flowers the grazing creature ranged,\nWas in her by a breath of Zeus conceived;\nAnd, as the hour of birth drew nigh,\nBy fate fulfilled, unto the light he came;\nAnd Epaphus for name,\nBorn from the touch of Zeus, the child received.\nOn him, on him I cry,\nAnd him for patron hold—\nWhile in this grassy vale I stand,\nWhere Io roamed of old!\nAnd here, recounting all her toil and pain,\nSigns will I show to those who rule the land\nThat I am child of hers; and all shall understand,\nHearing the doubtful tale of the dim past made plain.\nAnd, ere the end shall be,\nEach man the truth of what I tell shall see.\nAnd if there dwell hard by\nOne skilled to read from bird-notes augury,\nThat man, when through his ears shall thrill our tearful wail,\nShall deem he hears the voice, the plaintive tale\nOf her, the piteous spouse of Tereus, lord of guile—\nWhom the hawk harries yet, the mourning nightingale.\nShe, from her happy home and fair streams scared away,\nWails wild and sad for haunts beloved erewhile.\nYea, and for Itylus—ah, well-a-day!\nSlain by her own, his mother’s hand,\nMaddened by lustful wrong, the deed by Tereus planned.\nLike her I wail and wail, in soft Ionian tones,\nAnd as she wastes, even so\nWastes my soft cheek, once ripe with Nilus’ suns\nAnd all my heart dissolves in utter woe\nSad flowers of grief I cull,\nFleeing from kinsmen’s love unmerciful—\nYea, from the clutching hands, the wanton crowd,\nI sped across the waves, from Egypt’s land of cloud[1]\nGods of the ancient cradle of my race,\nHear me, just gods! With righteous grace\nOn me, on me look down!\nGrant not to youth its heart’s unchaste desire,\nBut, swiftly spurning lust’s unholy fire,\nBless only love and willing wedlock’s crown\nThe war-worn fliers from the battle’s wrack\nFind refuge at the hallowed altar-side,\nThe sanctuary divine,—\nYe gods! such refuge unto me provide—\nSuch sanctuary be mine!\nThough the deep will of Zeus be hard to track,\nYet doth it flame and glance,\nA beacon in the dark, ’mid clouds of chance\nThat wrap mankind\nYea, though the counsel fall, undone it shall not be,\nWhate’er be shaped and fixed within Zeus’ ruling mind—\nDark as a solemn grove, with sombre leafage shaded,\nHis paths of purpose wind,\nA marvel to man’s eye\nSmitten by him, from towering hopes degraded,\nMortals lie low and still\nTireless and effortless, works forth its will\nThe arm divine!\nGod from His holy seat, in calm of unarmed power,\nBrings forth the deed, at its appointed hour!\nLet Him look down on mortal wantonness!\nLo! how the youthful stock of Belus’ line\nCraves for me, uncontrolled—\nWith greed and madness bold—\nUrged on by passion’s sunless stress—\nAnd, cheated, learns too late the prey has ’scaped their hold!\nAh, listen, listen to my grievous tale,\nMy sorrow’s words, my shrill and tearful cries!\nAh woe, ah woe!\nLoud with lament the accents use,\nAnd from my living lips my own sad dirges flow!\nO Apian land of hill and dale,\nThou kennest yet, O land, this faltered foreign wail—\nHave mercy, hear my prayer!\nLo, how again, again, I rend and tear\nMy woven raiment, and from off my hair\nCast the Sidonian veil!\nAh, but if fortune smile, if death be driven away,\nVowed rites, with eager haste, we to the gods will pay!\nAlas, alas again!\nO wither drift the waves? and who shall loose the pain?\nO Apian land of hill and dale,\nThou kennest yet, O land, this faltered foreign wail!\nHave mercy, hear my prayer!\nLo, how again, again, I rend and tear\nMy woven raiment, and from off my hair\nCast the Sidonian veil!\nThe wafting oar, the bark with woven sail,\nFrom which the sea foamed back,\nSped me, unharmed of storms, along the breeze’s track—\nBe it unblamed of me!\nBut ah, the end, the end of my emprise!\nMay He, the Father, with all-seeing eyes,\nGrant me that end to see!\nGrant that henceforth unstained as heretofore\nI may escape the forced embrace\nOf those proud children of the race\nThat sacred Io bore.\nAnd thou, O maiden-goddess chaste and pure—\nQueen of the inner fane,—\nLook of thy grace on me, O Artemis,\nThy willing suppliant—thine, thine it is,\nWho from the lustful onslaught fled secure,\nTo grant that I too without stain\nThe shelter of thy purity may gain!\nGrant that henceforth unstained as heretofore\nI may escape the forced embrace\nOf those proud children of the race\nThat sacred Io bore!\nYet if this may not be,\nWe, the dark race sun-smitten, we\nWill speed with suppliant wands\nTo Zeus who rules below, with hospitable hands\nWho welcomes all the dead from all the lands:\nYea by our own hands strangled, we will go,\nSpurned by Olympian gods, unto the gods below!\nZeus, hear and save!\nThe searching, poisonous hate, that Io vexed and drave,\nWas of a goddess: well I know\nThe bitter ire, the wrathful woe\nOf Hera, queen of heaven—\nA storm, a storm her breath, whereby we yet are driven!\nBethink thee, what dispraise\nOf Zeus himself mankind will raise,\nIf now he turn his face averted from our cries!\nIf now, dishonoured and alone,\nThe ox-horned maiden’s race shall be undone,\nChildren of Epaphus, his own begotten son—\nZeus, listen from on high!—to thee our prayers arise.\nZeus, hear and save!\nThe searching poisonous hate, that Io vexed and drave,\nWas of a goddess: well I know\nThe bitter ire, the wrathful woe\nOf Hera, queen of heaven—\nA storm, a storm her breath, whereby we yet are driven!\nDANAUS.\nChildren, be wary—wary he with whom\nYe come, your trusty sire and steersman old:\nAnd that same caution hold I here on land,\nAnd bid you hoard my words, inscribing them\nOn memory’s tablets. Lo, I see afar\nDust, voiceless herald of a host, arise;\nAnd hark, within their grinding sockets ring\nAxles of hurrying wheels! I see approach,\nBorne in curved cars, by speeding horses drawn,\nA speared and shielded band. The chiefs, perchance,\nOf this their land are hitherward intent\nTo look on us, of whom they yet have heard\nBy messengers alone. But come who may,\nAnd come he peaceful or in ravening wrath\nSpurred on his path, ’twere best, in any case,\nDamsels, to cling unto this altar-mound\nMade sacred to their gods of festival,—\nA shrine is stronger than a tower to save,\nA shield that none may cleave. Step swift thereto,\nAnd in your left hands hold with reverence\nThe white-crowned wands of suppliance, the sign\nBeloved of Zeus, compassion’s lord, and speak\nTo those that question you, words meek and low\nAnd piteous, as beseems your stranger state,\nClearly avowing of this flight of yours\nThe bloodless cause; and on your utterance\nSee to it well that modesty attend;\nFrom downcast eyes, from brows of pure control,\nLet chastity look forth; nor, when ye speak,\nBe voluble nor eager—they that dwell\nWithin this land are sternly swift to chide.\nAnd be your words submissive: heed this well;\nFor weak ye are, outcasts on stranger lands,\nAnd froward talk beseems not strengthless hands.\nCHORUS.\nO father, warily to us aware\nThy words are spoken, and thy wisdom’s best\nMy mind shall hoard, with Zeus our sire to aid.\nDANAUS.\nEven so—with gracious aspect let him aid.\nCHORUS.\nFain were I now to seat me by thy side.\nDANAUS.\nNow dally not, but put our thought in act.\nCHORUS.\nZeus, pity our distress, or e’er we die.\nDANAUS.\nIf so he will, your toils to joy will turn.\nCHORUS.\nLo, on this shrine, the semblance of a bird.[2]\nDANAUS.\nZeus’ bird of dawn it is; invoke the sign.\nCHORUS.\nThus I invoke the saving rays of morn.\nDANAUS.\nNext, bright Apollo, exiled once from heaven.\nCHORUS.\nThe exiled god will pity our exile.\nDANAUS.\nYea, may he pity, giving grace and aid.\nCHORUS.\nWhom next invoke I, of these other gods?\nDANAUS.\nLo, here a trident, symbol of a god.\nCHORUS.\nWho[3] gave sea-safety; may he bless on land!\nDANAUS.\nThis next is Hermes, carved in Grecian wise.\nCHORUS.\nThen let him herald help to freedom won.\nDANAUS.\nLastly, adore this altar consecrate\nTo many lesser gods in one; then crouch\nOn holy ground, a flock of doves that flee,\nScared by no alien hawks, a kin not kind,\nHateful, and fain of love more hateful still.\nFoul is the bird that rends another bird,\nAnd foul the men who hale unwilling maids,\nFrom sire unwilling, to the bridal bed.\nNever on earth, nor in the lower world,\nShall lewdness such as theirs escape the ban:\nThere too, if men say right, a God there is\nWho upon dead men turns their sin to doom,\nTo final doom. Take heed, draw hitherward,\nThat from this hap your safety ye may win.\nEnter the KING OF ARGOS.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSpeak—of what land are ye? No Grecian band\nIs this to whom I speak, with Eastern robes\nAnd wrappings richly dight: no Argive maid,\nNo woman in all Greece such garb doth wear.\nThis too gives marvel, how unto this land,\nUnheralded, unfriended, without guide,\nAnd without fear, ye came? yet wands I see,\nTrue sign of suppliance, by you laid down\nOn shrines of these our gods of festival.\nNo land but Greece can read such signs aright.\nMuch else there is, conjecture well might guess,\nBut let words teach the man who stands to hear.\nCHORUS.\nTrue is the word thou spakest of my garb;\nBut speak I unto thee as citizen,\nOr Hermes’ wandbearer, or chieftain king?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nFor that, take heart and answer without fear.\nI am Pelasgus, ruler of this land,\nChild of Palaichthon, whom the earth brought forth;\nAnd, rightly named from me, the race who reap\nThis country’s harvests are Pelasgian called.\nAnd o’er the wide and westward-stretching land,\nThrough which the lucent wave of Strymon flows\nI rule; Perrhaebia’s land my boundary is\nNorthward, and Pindus’ further slopes, that watch\nPaeonia, and Dodona’s mountain ridge.\nWest, east, the limit of the washing seas\nRestrains my rule—the interspace is mine.\nBut this whereon we stand is Apian land,\nStyled so of old from the great healer’s name;\nFor Apis, coming from Naupactus’ shore\nBeyond the strait, child of Apollo’s self\nAnd like him seer and healer, cleansed this land\nFrom man-devouring monsters, whom the earth,\nStained with pollution of old bloodshedding,\nBrought forth in malice, beasts of ravening jaws,\nA grisly throng of serpents manifold.\nAnd healings of their hurt, by knife and charm,\nApis devised, unblamed of Argive men,\nAnd in their prayers found honour, for reward.\n—Lo, thou hast heard the tokens that I give:\nSpeak now thy race, and tell a forthright tale;\nIn sooth, this people loves not many words.\nCHORUS.\nShort is my word and clear. Of Argive race\nWe come, from her, the ox-horned maiden who\nErst bare the sacred child. My word shall give\nWhate’er can ’stablish this my soothfast tale.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nO stranger maids, I may not trust this word,\nThat ye have share in this our Argive race.\nNo likeness of our country do ye bear,\nBut semblance as of Libyan womankind.\nEven such a stock by Nilus’ banks might grow;\nYea and the Cyprian stamp, in female forms,\nShows to the life, what males impressed the same.\nAnd, furthermore, of roving Indian maids\nWhose camping-grounds by Aethiopia lie,\nAnd camels burdened even as mules, and bearing\nRiders, as horses bear, mine ears have heard;\nAnd tales of flesh-devouring mateless maids\nCalled Amazons: to these, if bows ye bare,\nI most had deemed you like. Speak further yet,\nThat of your Argive birth the truth I learn.\nCHORUS.\nHere in this Argive land—so runs the tale—\nIo was priestess once of Hera’s fane.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nYea, truth it is, and far this word prevails:\nIs’t said that Zeus with mortal mingled love?\nCHORUS.\nAy, and that Hera that embrace surmised.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHow issued then this strife of those on high?\nCHORUS.\nBy Hera’s will, a heifer she became.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHeld Zeus aloof then from the horned beast?\nCHORUS.\n’Tis said, he loved, in semblance of a bull.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAnd his stern consort, did she aught thereon?\nCHORUS.\nOne myriad-eyed she set, the heifer’s guard.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHow namest thou this herdsman many-eyed?\nCHORUS.\nArgus, the child of Earth, whom Hermes slew.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nStill did the goddess vex the beast ill-starred?\nCHORUS.\nShe wrought a gadfly with a goading sting.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nThus drave she Io hence, to roam afar?\nCHORUS.\nYea—this thy word coheres exact with mine.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nThen to Canopus and to Memphis came she?\nCHORUS.\nAnd by Zeus’ hand was touched, and bare a child.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWho vaunts him the Zeus-mated creature’s son?\nCHORUS.\nEpaphus, named rightly from the saving touch.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAnd whom in turn did Epaphus beget?[4]\nCHORUS.\nLibya, with name of a wide land endowed.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAnd who from her was born unto the race?\nCHORUS.\nBelus: from him two sons, my father one.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSpeak now to me his name, this greybeard wise.\nCHORUS.\nRevere the gods thus crowned, who steer the State.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAwe thrills me, seeing these shrines with leafage crowned.\nCHORUS.\nYea, stern the wrath of Zeus, the suppliants’ lord.\nChild of Palaichthon, royal chief\nOf thy Pelasgians, hear!\nBow down thine heart to my relief—\nA fugitive, a suppliant, swift with fear,\nA creature whom the wild wolves chase\nO’er toppling crags; in piteous case\nAloud, afar she lows,\nCalling the herdsman’s trusty arm to save her from her foes!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nLo, with bowed heads beside our city shrines\nYe sit ’neath shade of new-plucked olive-boughs.\nOur distant kin’s resentment Heaven forefend!\nLet not this hap, unhoped and unforeseen,\nBring war on us: for strife we covet not.\nCHORUS.\nJustice, the daughter of right-dealing Zeus,\nJustice, the queen of suppliants, look down,\nThat this our plight no ill may loose\nUpon your town!\nThis word, even from the young, let age and wisdom learn:\nIf thou to suppliants show grace,\nThou shalt not lack Heaven’s grace in turn,\nSo long as virtue’s gifts on heavenly shrines have place.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nNot at my private hearth ye sit and sue;\nAnd if the city bear a common stain,\nBe it the common toil to cleanse the same:\nTherefore no pledge, no promise will I give,\nEre counsel with the commonwealth be held.\nCHORUS.\nNay, but the source of sway, the city’s self, art thou,\nA power unjudged! thine, only thine,\nTo rule the right of hearth and shrine!\nBefore thy throne and sceptre all men bow!\nThou, in all causes lord, beware the curse divine!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nMay that curse fall upon mine enemies!\nI cannot aid you without risk of scathe,\nNor scorn your prayers—unmerciful it were.\nPerplexed, distraught I stand, and fear alike\nThe twofold chance, to do or not to do.\nCHORUS.\nHave heed of him who looketh from on high,\nThe guard of woeful mortals, whosoe’er\nUnto their fellows cry,\nAnd find no pity, find no justice there.\nAbiding in his wrath, the suppliants’ lord\nDoth smite, unmoved by cries, unbent by prayerful word.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nBut if Aegyptus’ children grasp you here,\nClaiming, their country’s right, to hold you theirs\nAs next of kin, who dares to counter this?\nPlead ye your country’s laws, if plead ye may,\nThat upon you they lay no lawful hand.\nCHORUS.\nLet me not fall, O nevermore,\nA prey into the young men’s hand;\nRather than wed whom I abhor,\nBy pilot-stars I flee this land;\nO king, take justice to thy side,\nAnd with the righteous powers decide!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nHard is the cause—make me not judge thereof.\nAlready I have vowed it, to do nought\nSave after counsel with my people ta’en,\nKing though I be; that ne’er in after time,\nIf ill fate chance, my people then may say—\nIn aid of strangers thou the state hast slain.\nCHORUS.\nZeus, lord of kinship, rules at will\nThe swaying balance, and surveys\nEvil and good; to men of ill\nGives evil, and to good men praise.\nAnd thou—since true those scales do sway—\nShall thou from justice shrink away?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nA deep, a saving counsel here there needs—\nAn eye that like a diver to the depth\nOf dark perplexity can pass and see,\nUndizzied, unconfused. First must we care\nThat to the State and to ourselves this thing\nShall bring no ruin; next, that wrangling hands\nShall grasp you not as prey, nor we ourselves\nBetray you thus embracing sacred shrines,\nNor make the avenging all-destroying god,\nWho not in hell itself sets dead men free,\nA grievous inmate, an abiding bane.—\nSpake I not right, of saving counsel’s need?\nCHORUS.\nYea, counsel take and stand to aid\nAt Justice’ side and mine.\nBetray not me, the timorous maid\nWhom far beyond the brine\nA godless violence cast forth forlorn.\nO King, wilt thou behold—\nLord of this land, wilt thou behold me torn\nFrom altars manifold?\nBethink thee of the young men’s wrath and lust,\nHold off their evil pride;\nSteel not thyself to see the suppliant thrust\nFrom hallowed statues’ side,\nHaled by the frontlet on my forehead bound,\nAs steeds are led, and drawn\nBy hands that drag from shrine and altar-mound\nMy vesture’s fringed lawn.\nKnow thou that whether for Aegyptus’ race\nThou dost their wish fulfil,\nOr for the gods and for each holy place—\nBe thy choice good or ill,\nBlow is with blow requited, grace with grace\nSuch is Zeus’ righteous will.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nYea, I have pondered: from the sea of doubt\nHere drives at length the bark of thought ashore;\nLandward with screw and windlass haled, and firm,\nClamped to her props, she lies. The need is stern;\nWith men or gods a mighty strife we strive\nPerforce, and either hap in grief concludes.\nFor, if a house be sacked, new wealth for old\nNot hard it is to win—if Zeus the lord\nOf treasure favour—more than quits the loss,\nEnough to pile the store of wealth full high;\nOr if a tongue shoot forth untimely speech,\nBitter and strong to goad a man to wrath,\nSoft words there be to soothe that wrath away:\nBut what device shall make the war of kin\nBloodless? that woe, the blood of many beasts,\nAnd victims manifold to many gods,\nAlone can cure. Right glad I were to shun\nThis strife, and am more fain of ignorance\nThan of the wisdom of a woe endured.\nThe gods send better than my soul foretells!\nCHORUS.\nOf many cries for mercy, hear the end.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSay on, then, for it shall not ’scape mine ear.\nCHORUS.\nGirdles we have, and bands that bind our robes.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nEven so; such things beseem a woman’s wear.\nCHORUS.\nKnow, then, with these a fair device there is—\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nSpeak, then: what utterance doth this foretell?\nCHORUS.\nUnless to us thou givest pledge secure—\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWhat can thy girdles’ craft achieve for thee?\nCHORUS.\nStrange votive tablets shall these statues deck.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nMysterious thy resolve—avow it clear.\nCHORUS.\nSwiftly to hang me on these sculptured gods!\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nThy word is as a lash to urge my heart.\nCHORUS.\nThou seest truth, for I have cleared thine eye\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nYea, and woes manifold, invincible,\nA crowd of ills, sweep on me torrent-like.\nMy bark goes forth upon a sea of troubles\nUnfathomed, ill to traverse, harbourless.\nFor if my deed shall match not your demand,\nDire, beyond shot of speech, shall be the bane\nYour death’s pollution leaves unto this land.\nYet if against your kin, Aegyptus’ race,\nBefore our gates I front the doom of war,\nWill not the city’s loss be sore? Shall men\nFor women’s sake incarnadine the ground?\nBut yet the wrath of Zeus, the suppliants’ lord\nI needs must fear: most awful unto man\nThe terror of his anger. Thou, old man,\nThe father of these maidens, gather up\nWithin your arms these wands of suppliance,\nAnd lay them at the altars manifold\nOf all our country’s gods, that all the town\nKnow, by this sign, that ye come here to sue.\nNor, in thy haste, do thou say aught of me.\nSwift is this folk to censure those who rule;\nBut, if they see these signs of suppliance,\nIt well may chance that each will pity you,\nAnd loathe the young men’s violent pursuit;\nAnd thus a fairer favour you may find:\nFor, to the helpless, each man’s heart is kind.\nDANAUS.\nTo us, beyond gifts manifold it is\nTo find a champion thus compassionate;\nYet send with me attendants, of thy folk,\nRightly to guide me, that I duly find\nEach altar of your city’s gods that stands\nBefore the fane, each dedicated shrine;\nAnd that in safety through the city’s ways\nI may pass onwards: all unlike to yours\nThe outward semblance that I wear—the race\nthat Nilus rears is all dissimilar\nThat of Inachus. Keep watch and ward\nLest heedlessness bring death: full oft, I ween,\nFriend hath slain friend, not knowing whom he slew.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nGo at his side, attendants,—he saith well.\nOn to the city’s consecrated shrines!\nNor be of many words to those ye meet,\nThe while this suppliant voyager ye lead.\n[Exit DANAUS with attendants.]\nCHORUS.\nLet him go forward, thy command obeying.\nBut me how biddest, how assurest thou?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nLeave there the new-plucked boughs, thy sorrow’s sign.\nCHORUS.\nThus beckoned forth, at thy behest I leave them.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nNow to this level precinct turn thyself.\nCHORUS.\nUnconsecrate it is, and cannot shield me.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWe will not yield thee to those falcons’ greed.\nCHORUS.\nWhat help? more fierce they are than serpents fell.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nWe spake thee fair—speak thou them fair in turn.\nCHORUS.\nWhat marvel that we loathe them, scared in soul?\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nAwe towards a king should other fears transcend.\nCHORUS.\nThus speak, thus act, and reassure my mind.\nTHE KING OF ARGOS.\nNot long thy sire shall leave thee desolate.\nBut I will call the country’s indwellers,\nAnd with soft words th’ assembly will persuade,\nAnd warn your sire what pleadings will avail.\nTherefore abide ye, and with prayer entreat\nThe country’s gods to compass your desire;\nThe while I go, this matter to provide,\nPersuasion and fair fortune at my side.\n[Exit the KING OF ARGOS.]\nCHORUS.\nO King of Kings, among the blest\nThou highest and thou happiest,\nListen and grant our prayer,\nAnd, deeply loathing, thrust\nAway from us the young men’s lust,\nAnd deeply drown\nIn azure waters, down and ever down,\nBenches and rowers dark,\nThe fatal and perfidious bark!\nUnto the maidens turn thy gracious care;\nThink yet again upon the tale of fame,\nHow from the maiden loved of thee there sprung\nMine ancient line, long since in many a legend sung!\nRemember, O remember, thou whose hand\nDid Io by a touch to human shape reclaim.\nFor from this Argos erst our mother came\nDriven hence to Egypt’s land,\nYet sprung of Zeus we were, and hence our birth we claim.\nAnd now have I roamed back\nUnto the ancient track\nWhere Io roamed and pastured among flowers,\nWatched o’er by Argus’ eyes,\nThrough the lush grasses and the meadow bowers.\nThence, by the gadfly maddened, forth she flies\nUnto far lands and alien peoples driven\nAnd, following fate, through paths of foam and surge,\nSees, as she goes, the cleaving strait divide\nGreece, from the Eastland riven.\nAnd swift through Asian borders doth she urge\nHer course, o’er Phrygian mountains’ sheep-clipt side;\nThence, where the Mysian realm of Teuthras lies\nTowards Lydian lowlands hies,\nAnd o’er Cilician and Pamphylian hills\nAnd ever-flowing rills,\nAnd thence to Aphrodite’s fertile shore,[5]\nThe land of garnered wheat and wealthy store\nAnd thence, deep-stung by wild unrest,\nBy the winged fly that goaded her and drave,\nUnto the fertile land, the god-possest,\n(Where, fed from far-off snows,\nLife-giving Nilus flows,\nUrged on by Typho’s strength, a fertilizing wave)\nShe roves, in harassed and dishonoured flight\nScathed by the blasting pangs of Hera’s dread despite.\nAnd they within the land\nWith terror shook and wanned,\nSo strange the sight they saw, and were afraid—\nA wild twy-natured thing, half heifer and half maid.\nWhose hand was laid at last on Io, thus forlorn,\nWith many roamings worn?\nWho bade the harassed maiden’s peace return?\nZeus, lord of time eterne.\nYea, by his breath divine, by his unscathing strength,\nShe lays aside her bane,\nAnd softened back to womanhood at length\nSheds human tears again.\nThen, quickened with Zeus’ veritable seed,\nA progeny she bare,\nA stainless babe, a child of heavenly breed.\nOf life and fortune fair.\nHis is the life of life—so all men say,—\nHis is the seed of Zeus.\nWho else had power stern Hera’s craft to stay,\nHer vengeful curse to loose?\nYea, all from Zeus befell!\nAnd rightly wouldst thou tell\nThat we from Epaphus, his child, were born:\nJustly his deed was done;\nUnto what other one,\nOf all the gods, should I for justice turn?\nFrom him our race did spring;\nCreator he and King,\nAncient of days and wisdom he, and might.\nAs bark before the wind,\nSo, wafted by his mind,\nMoves every counsel, each device aright.\nBeneath no stronger hand\nHolds he a weak command,\nNo throne doth he abase him to adore;\nSwift as a word, his deed\nActs out what stands decreed\nIn counsels of his heart, for evermore.\nRe-enter DANAUS.\nDANAUS.\nTake heart, my children: the land’s heart is kind,\nAnd to full issue has their voting come.\nCHORUS.\nAll hail, my sire; thy word brings utmost joy.\nSay, to what issue is the vote made sure,\nAnd how prevailed the people’s crowding hands?\nDANAUS.\nWith one assent the Argives spake their will,\nAnd, hearing, my old heart took youthful cheer,\nThe very sky was thrilled when high in air\nThe concourse raised right hands and swore their oath:—\nFree shall the maidens sojourn in this land.\nUnharried, undespoiled by mortal wight:\nNo native hand, no hand of foreigner\nShall drag them hence; if any man use force—\nWhoe’er of all our countrymen shall fail\nTo come unto their aid, let him go forth,\nBeneath the people’s curse, to banishment.\nSo did the king of this Pelasgian folk\nPlead on behalf of us, and bade them heed\nThat never, in the after-time, this realm\nShould feed to fulness the great enmity\nOf Zeus, the suppliants’ guard, against itself!\nA twofold curse, for wronging stranger-guests\nWho are akin withal, confrontingly\nShould rise before this city and be shown\nA ruthless monster, fed on human doom.\nSuch things the Argive people heard, and straight,\nWithout proclaim of herald, gave assent:\nYea, in full conclave, the Pelasgian folk\nHeard suasive pleas, and Zeus through them resolved.\nCHORUS.\nArouse we now to chant our prayer\nFor fair return of service fair\nAnd Argos’ kindly will.\nZeus, lord of guestright, look upon\nThe grace our stranger lips have won.\nIn right and truth, as they begun,\nGuide them, with favouring hand, until\nThou dost their blameless wish fulfil!\nNow may the Zeus-born gods on high\nHear us pour forth\nA votive prayer for Argos’ clan!—\nNever may this Pelasgian earth,\nAmid the fire-wrack, shrill the dismal cry\nOn Ares, ravening lord of fight,\nWho in an alien harvest mows down man!\nFor lo, this land had pity on our plight,\nAnd unto us were merciful and leal,\nTo us, the piteous flock, who at Zeus’ altar kneel!\nThey scornèd not the pleas of maidenhood,\nNor with the young men’s will hath their will stood.\nThey knew right well.\nTh’ unearthly watching fiend invincible,\nThe foul avenger—let him not draw near!\nFor he, on roofs ill-starred,\nDefiling and polluting, keeps a ghastly ward!\nThey knew his vengeance, and took holy heed\nTo us, the sister suppliants, who cry\nTo Zeus, the lord of purity:\nTherefore with altars pure they shall the gods revere.\nThus, through the boughs that shade our lips, fly forth in air,\nFly forth, O eager prayer!\nMay never pestilence efface\nThis city’s race,\nNor be the land with corpses strewed,\nNor stained with civic blood!\nThe stem of youth, unpluckt, to manhood come,\nNor Ares rise from Aphrodité’s bower,\nThe lord of death and bane, to waste our youthful flower.\nLong may the old\nCrowd to the altars kindled to consume\nGifts rich and manifold—\nOffered to win from powers divine\nA benison on city and on shrine:\nLet all the sacred might adore\nOf Zeus most high, the lord\nOf guestright and the hospitable board,\nWhose immemorial law doth rule Fate’s scales aright:\nThe garners of earth’s store\nBe full for evermore,\nAnd grace of Artemis make women’s travail light;\nNo devastating curse of fell disease\nThis city seize;\nNo clamour of the State arouse to war\nAres, from whom afar\nShrinketh the lute, by whom the dances fail—\nAres, the lord of wail.\nSwarm far aloof from Argos’ citizens\nAll plague and pestilence,\nAnd may the Archer-God our children spare!\nMay Zeus with foison and with fruitfulness\nThe land’s each season bless,\nAnd, quickened with Heaven’s bounty manifold,\nTeem grazing flock and fold.\nBeside the altars of Heaven’s hallowing\nLoud let the minstrels sing,\nAnd from pure lips float forth the harp-led strain in air!\nAnd let the people’s voice, the power\nThat sways the State, in danger’s hour\nBe wary, wise for all;\nNor honour in dishonour hold,\nBut—ere the voice of war be bold—\nLet them to stranger peoples grant\nFair and unbloody covenant—\nJustice and peace withal;\nAnd to the Argive powers divine\nThe sacrifice of laurelled kine,\nBy rite ancestral, pay.\nAmong three words of power and awe,\nStands this, the third, the mighty law—\nYour gods, your fathers deified,\nYe shall adore. Let this abide\nFor ever and for aye.\nDANAUS.\nDear children, well and wisely have ye prayed;\nI bid you now not shudder, though ye hear\nNew and alarming tidings from your sire.\nFrom this high place beside the suppliants’ shrine\nThe bark of our pursuers I behold,\nBy divers tokens recognized too well.\nLo, the spread canvas and the hides that screen\nThe gunwale; lo, the prow, with painted eyes\nThat seem her onward pathway to descry,\nHeeding too well the rudder at the stern\nThat rules her, coming for no friendly end.\nAnd look, the seamen—all too plain their race—\nTheir dark limbs gleam from out their snow-white garb;\nPlain too the other barks, a fleet that comes\nAll swift to aid the purpose of the first,\nThat now, with furled sail and with pulse of oars\nWhich smite the wave together, comes aland.\nBut ye, be calm, and, schooled not scared by fear,\nConfront this chance, be mindful of your trust\nIn these protecting gods. And I will hence,\nAnd champions who shall plead your cause aright\nWill bring unto your side. There come perchance\nHeralds or envoys, eager to lay hand\nAnd drag you captive hence; yet fear them not;\nFoiled shall they be. Yet well it were for you\n(If, ere with aid I come, I tarry long),\nNot by one step this sanctuary to leave.\nFarewell, fear nought: soon shall the hour be born\nWhen he that scorns the gods shall rue his scorn\nCHORUS.\nAh but I shudder, father!—ah, even now,\nEven as I speak, the swift-winged ships draw nigh!\nI shudder, I shiver, I perish with fear:\nOverseas though I fled,\nYet nought it avails; my pursuers are near!\nDANAUS.\nChildren, take heart; they who decreed to aid\nThy cause will arm for battle, well I ween.\nCHORUS.\nBut desperate is Aegyptus’ ravening race,\nWith fight unsated; thou too know’st it well.\nIn their wrath they o’ertake us; the prow is deep-dark\nIn the which they have sped,\nAnd dark is the bench and the crew of the bark!\nDANAUS.\nYea but a crew as stout they here shall find,\nAnd arms well steeled beneath a noon-day sun.\nCHORUS.\nAh yet, O father, leave us not forlorn!\nAlone, a maid is nought, a strengthless arm.\nWith guile they pursue me, with counsel malign,\nAnd unholy their soul;\nAnd as ravens they seize me, unheeding the shrine!\nDANAUS.\nFair will befall us, children, in this chance,\nIf thus in wrath they wrong the gods and you.\nCHORUS.\nAlas, nor tridents nor the sanctity\nOf shrines will drive them, O my sire, from us!\nUnholy and daring and cursed is their ire,\nNor own they control\nOf the gods, but like jackals they glut their desire!\nDANAUS.\nAy, but Come wolf, flee jackal, saith the saw;\nNor can the flax-plant overbear the corn.\nCHORUS.\nLustful, accursèd, monstrous is their will\nAs of beasts ravening—’ware we of their power!\nDANAUS.\nLook you, not swiftly puts a fleet to sea,\nNor swiftly to its moorings; long it is\nOr e’er the saving cables to the shore\nAre borne, and long or e’er the steersmen cry,\nThe good ship swings at anchor—all is well.\nLongest of all, the task to come aland\nWhere haven there is none, when sunset fades\nIn night. To pilot wise, the adage saith,\nNight is a day of wakefulness and pain.\nTherefore no force of weaponed men, as yet\nScatheless can come ashore, before the bank\nLie at her anchorage securely moored.\nBethink thee therefore, nor in panic leave\nThe shrine of gods whose succour thou hast won\nI go for aid—men shall not blame me long,\nOld, but with youth at heart and on my tongue.\n[Exit DANAUS.]\nCHORUS.\nO land of hill and dale, O holy land,\nWhat shall befall us? whither shall we flee,\nFrom Apian land to some dark lair of earth?\nO would that in vapour of smoke I might rise to the clouds of the sky,\nThat as dust which flits up without wings I might pass and evanish and die!\nI dare not, I dare not abide: my heart yearns, eager to fly;\nAnd dark is the cast of my thought; I shudder and tremble for fear.\nMy father looked forth and beheld: I die of the sight that draws near.\nAnd for me be the strangling cord, the halter made ready by Fate,\nBefore to my body draws nigh the man of my horror and hate.\nNay, ere I will own him as lord, as handmaid to Hades I go!\nAnd oh, that aloft in the sky, where the dark clouds are frozen to snow,\nA refuge for me might be found, or a mountain-top smooth and too high\nFor the foot of the goat, where the vulture sits lonely, and none may descry\nThe pinnacle veiled in the cloud, the highest and sheerest of all,\nEre to wedlock that rendeth my heart, and love that is loveless, I fall!\nYea, a prey to the dogs and the birds of the mount will I give me to be,—\nFrom wailing and curse and pollution it is death, only death, sets me free:\nLet death come upon me before to the ravisher’s bed I am thrust;\nWhat champion, what saviour but death can I find, or what refuge from lust?\nI will utter my shriek of entreaty, a prayer that shrills up to the sky,\nThat calleth the gods to compassion, a tuneful, a pitiful cry,\nThat is loud to invoke the releaser. O father, look down on the fight;\nLook down in thy wrath on the wronger, with eyes that are eager for right.\nZeus, thou that art lord of the world, whose kingdom is strong over all,\nHave mercy on us! At thine altar for refuge and safety we call.\nFor the race of Aegyptus is fierce, with greed and with malice afire;\nThey cry as the questing hounds, they sweep with the speed of desire.\nBut thine is the balance of fate, thou rulest the wavering scale,\nAnd without thee no mortal emprise shall have strength to achieve or prevail.\nAlack, alack! the ravisher—\nHe leaps from boat to beach, he draweth near!\nAway, thou plunderer accurst!\nDeath seize thee first,\nOr e’er thou touch me—off! God, hear our cry,\nOur maiden agony!\nAh, ah, the touch, the prelude of my shame.\nAlas, my maiden fame!\nO sister, sister, to the altar cling,\nFor he that seizeth me,\nGrim is his wrath and stern, by land as on the sea.\nGuard us, O king!\nEnter the HERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nHence to my barge—step swiftly, tarry not.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, he rends—he rends my hair! O wound on wound!\nHelp! my lopped head will fall, my blood gush o’er the ground!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nAboard, ye cursèd—with a new curse, go!\nCHORUS.\nWould God that on the wand’ring brine\nThou and this braggart tongue of thine\nHad sunk beneath the main—\nThy mast and planks, made fast in vain!\nThee would I drive aboard once more,\nA slayer and a dastard, from the shore!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nBe still, thou vain demented soul;\nMy force thy craving shall control.\nAway, aboard! What, clingest to the shrine?\nAway! this city’s gods I hold not for divine.\nCHORUS.\nAid me, ye gods, that never, never\nI may again behold\nThe mighty, the life-giving river,\nNilus, the quickener of field and fold!\nAlack, O sire, unto the shrine I cling—\nShrine of this land from which mine ancient line did spring!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nShrines, shrines, forsooth!—the ship, the ship be shrine!\nAboard, perforce and will-ye nill-ye, go!\nOr e’er from hands of mine\nYe suffer torments worse and blow on blow.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, God grant those hands may strive in vain\nWith the salt-streaming wave,\nWhen ’gainst the wide-blown blasts thy bark shall strain\nTo round Sarpedon’s cape, the sandbank’s treach’rous grave.\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nShrill ye and shriek unto what gods ye may,\nYe shall not leap from out Aegyptus’ bark,\nHow bitterly soe’er ye wail your woe.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, alack my wrong!\nStern is thy voice, thy vaunting loud and strong.\nThy sire, the mighty Nilus, drive thee hence\nTurning to death and doom thy greedy violence!\nHERALD OF AEGYPTUS.\nSwift to the vessel of the double prow,\nGo quickly! let none linger, else this hand\nRuthless will hale you by your tresses hence.\nCHORUS.\nAlack, O father! from the shrine\nNot aid but agony is mine.\nAs a spider he creeps and he clutches his prey,\nAnd he hales me away.\nA spectre of darkness, of darkness.

Before the encampment of Aias on the shore of the Troad. Afterwards a lonely place beyond Rhoeteum.\nTime, towards the end of the Trojan War.\n[page 42]‘A wounded spirit who can bear?’\nAfter the death of Achilles, the armour made for him by Hephaestus was to be given to the worthiest of the surviving Greeks. Although Aias was the most valiant, the judges made the award to Odysseus, because he was the wisest.\nAias in his rage attempts to kill the generals; but Athena sends madness upon him, and he makes a raid upon the flocks and herds of the army, imagining the bulls and rams to be the Argive chiefs. On awakening from his delusion, he finds that he has fallen irrecoverably from honour and from the favour of the Greeks. He also imagines that the anger of Athena is unappeasable. Under this impression he eludes the loving eyes of his captive-bride Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian comrades, and falls on his sword. (‘The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.’)\nBut it is revealed through the prophet Calchas, that the wrath of Athena will last only for a day; and on the return of Teucer, Aias receives an honoured funeral, the tyrannical reclamations of the two sons of Atreus being overcome by the firm fidelity of Teucer and the magnanimity of Odysseus, who has been inspired for this purpose by Athena.\n[page 43]\nAIAS\nATHENA (above). ODYSSEUS.\nATHENA. Oft have I seen thee, Laërtiades,\nIntent on some surprisal of thy foes;\nAs now I find thee by the seaward camp,\nWhere Aias holds the last place in your line,\nLingering in quest, and scanning the fresh print\nOf his late footsteps, to be certified\nIf he keep house or no. Right well thy sense\nHath led thee forth, like some keen hound of Sparta!\nThe man is even but now come home, his head\nAnd slaughterous hands reeking with ardent toil.\nThou, then, no longer strain thy gaze within\nYon gateway, but declare what eager chase\nThou followest, that a god may give thee light.\nODYSSEUS. Athena, ’tis thy voice! Dearest in heaven,\nHow well discerned and welcome to my soul\nFrom that dim distance doth thine utterance fly\nIn tones as of Tyrrhenian trumpet clang!\nRightly hast thou divined mine errand here,\nBeating this ground for Aias of the shield,\nThe lion-quarry whom I track to day.\nFor he hath wrought on us to night a deed\nPast thought—if he be doer of this thing;\nWe drift in ignorant doubt, unsatisfied—\nAnd I unbidden have bound me to this toil.\nBrief time hath flown since suddenly we knew\nThat all our gathered spoil was reaved and slaughtered,\nFlocks, herds, and herdmen, by some human hand,\nAll tongues, then, lay this deed at Aias’ door.\nAnd one, a scout who had marked him, all alone,\nWith new-fleshed weapon bounding o’er the plain,\n[page 44][31-66]Gave me to know it, when immediately\nI darted on the trail, and here in part\nI find some trace to guide me, but in part\nI halt, amazed, and know not where to look.\nThou com’st full timely. For my venturous course,\nPast or to come, is governed by thy will.\nATH. I knew thy doubts, Odysseus, and came forth\nZealous to guard thy perilous hunting-path.\nOD. Dear Queen! and am I labouring to an end?\nATH. Thou schem’st not idly. This is Aias’ deed.\nOD. What can have roused him to a work so wild?\nATH. His grievous anger for Achilles’ arms.\nOD. But wherefore on the flock this violent raid?\nATH. He thought to imbrue his hands with your heart’s blood.\nOD. What? Was this planned against the Argives, then?\nATH. Planned, and performed, had I kept careless guard.\nOD. What daring spirit, what hardihood, was here!\nATH. Alone by night in craft he sought your tents.\nOD. How? Came he near them? Won he to his goal?\nATH. He stood in darkness at the generals’ gates.\nOD. What then restrained his eager hand from murder?\nATH. I turned him backward from his baleful joy,\nAnd overswayed him with blind phantasies,\nTo swerve against the flocks and well-watched herd\nNot yet divided from the public booty.\nThere plunging in he hewed the horned throng,\nAnd with him Havoc ranged: while now he thought\nTo kill the Atreidae with hot hand, now this\nNow that commander, as the fancy grew.\nI, joining with the tumult of his mind,\nFlung the wild victim on the fatal net.\nAnon, this toil being overpast, he draws\nThe living oxen and the panting sheep\nWith cords to his home, not as a hornèd prey,\nBut as in triumph marshalling his foes:\nWhom now he tortures in their bonds within.\nCome, thou shalt see this madness in clear day,\n[page 45][67-100]And tell to the Argives all I show thee here\nOnly stand firm and shrink not, I will turn\nHis eyes askance, not to distinguish thee,\nFear nought—Ho! thou that bindest to thy will\nThe limbs of those thy captives, come thou forth!\nAias! advance before thy palace gate!\nOD. My Queen! what dost thou? Never call him forth.\nATH. Hush, hush! Be not so timorous, but endure.\nOD. Nay, nay! Enough. He is there, and let him bide.\nATH. What fear you? Dates his valour from to day?\nOD. He was and is my valiant enemy.\nATH. Then is not laughter sweetest o’er a foe?\nOD. No more! I care not he should pass abroad.\nATH. You flinch from seeing the madman in full view.\nOD. When sane, I ne’er had flinched before his face.\nATH. Well, but even now he shall not know thee near.\nOD. How, if his eyes be not transformed or lost?\nATH. I will confound his sense although he see.\nOD. Well, nothing is too hard for Deity.\nATH. Stand still and keep thy place without a word.\nOD. I must. Would I were far away from here!\nATH. Aias! Again I summon thee. Why pay\nSo scanty heed to her who fights for thee?\nEnter AIAS with a bloody scourge.\nAIAS. Hail, offspring of the Highest! Pallas, hail!\nWell hast thou stood by me. Triumphal gold\nShall crown thy temple for this lordly prey.\nATH. A fair intention! But resolve me this:\nHast dyed thy falchion deep in Argive blood?\nAI. There is my boast; that charge I’ll ne’er deny.\nATH. Have Atreus’ sons felt thy victorious might?\nAI. They have. No more they’ll make a scorn of me!\nATH. I take it, then, they are dead.\nAI. Ay, now they are dead,\nLet them arise and rob me of mine arms!\n[page 46][101-133]ATH. Good. Next inform us of Laërtes’ son;\nHow stands his fortune? Hast thou let him go?\nAI. The accursed fox! Dost thou inquire of him?\nATH. Ay, of Odysseus, thy late adversary.\nAI. He sits within, dear lady, to my joy,\nBound; for I mean him not just yet to die.\nATH. What fine advantage wouldst thou first achieve?\nAI. First, tie him to a pillar of my hall—\nATH. Poor wretch! What torment wilt thou wreak on him?\nAI. Then stain his back with scourging till he die.\nATH. Nay, ’tis too much. Poor caitiff! Not the scourge!\nAI. Pallas, in all things else have thou thy will,\nBut none shall wrest Odysseus from this doom.\nATH. Well, since thou art determined on the deed,\nSpare nought of thine intent: indulge thy hand!\nAI. (waving the bloody scourge.)\nI go! But thou, I charge thee, let thine aid\nBe evermore like valiant as to-day.[Exit\nATH. The gods are strong, Odysseus. Dost thou see?\nWhat man than Aias was more provident,\nOr who for timeliest action more approved?\nOD. I know of none. But, though he hates me sore,\nI pity him, poor mortal, thus chained fast\nTo a wild and cruel fate,—weighing not so much\nHis fortune as mine own. For now I feel\nAll we who live are but an empty show\nAnd idle pageant of a shadowy dream.\nATH. Then, warned by what thou seest, be thou not rash\nTo vaunt high words toward Heaven, nor swell thy port\nToo proudly, if in puissance of thy hand\nThou passest others, or in mines of wealth.\nSince Time abases and uplifts again\nAll that is human, and the modest heart\nIs loved by Heaven, who hates the intemperate will.[Exeunt\n[page 47][134-156]\nCHORUS (entering).\nTelamonian child, whose hand\nGuards our wave-encircled land,\nSalamis that breasts the sea,\nGood of thine is joy to me;\nBut if One who reigns above\nSmite thee, or if murmurs move\nFrom fierce Danaäns in their hate\nFull of threatening to thy state,\nAll my heart for fear doth sigh,\nShrinking like a dove’s soft eye.\nHardly had the darkness waned,[Half-Chorus I.\nWhen our ears were filled and pained\nWith huge scandal on thy fame.\nTelling, thine the arm that came\nTo the cattle-browsèd mead,\nWild with prancing of the steed,\nAnd that ravaged there and slew\nWith a sword of fiery hue\nAll the spoils that yet remain,\nBy the sweat of spearmen ta’en.\nSuch report against thy life,[Half-Chorus II.\nWhispered words with falsehood rife,\nWise Odysseus bringing near\nShrewdly gaineth many an ear:\nSince invention against thee\nFindeth hearing speedily,\nTallying with the moment’s birth;\nAnd with loudly waxing mirth\nHeaping insult on thy grief,\nEach who hears it glories more\nThan the tongue that told before.\nEvery slander wins belief\nAimed at souls whose worth is chief:\nShot at me, or one so small,\nSuch a bolt might harmless fall.\n[page 48][157-192]Ever toward the great and high\nCreepeth climbing jealousy\nYet the low without the tall\nMake at need a tottering wall\nLet the strong the feeble save\nAnd the mean support the brave.\nCHORUS.\nAh! ’twere vain to tune such song\n’Mid the nought discerning throng\nWho are clamouring now ’gainst thee\nLong and loud, and strengthless we,\nMighty chieftain, thou away,\nTo withstand the gathering fray\nFlocking fowl with carping cry\nSeem they, lurking from thine eye,\nTill the royal eagle’s poise\nOverawe the paltry noise\nTill before thy presence hushed\nSudden sink they, mute and crushed.\nDid bull slaying Artemis, Zeus’ cruel daughterI 1\n(Ah, fearful rumour, fountain of my shame!)\nPrompt thy fond heart to this disastrous slaughter\nOf the full herd stored in our army’s name!\nSay, had her blood stained temple missed the kindness\nOf some vow promised fruit of victory,\nFoiled of some glorious armour through thy blindness,\nOr fell some stag ungraced by gift from thee?\nOr did stern Ares venge his thankless spear\nThrough this night foray that hath cost thee dear!\nFor never, if thy heart were not distractedI 2\nBy stings from Heaven, O child of Telamon,\nWouldst thou have bounded leftward, to have acted\nThus wildly, spoiling all our host hath won!\nMadness might fall some heavenly power forfend it\nBut if Odysseus and the tyrant lords\nSuggest a forged tale, O rise to end it,\nNor fan the fierce flame of their withering words!\n[page 49][201-226]Forth from thy tent, and let thine eye confound\nThe brood of Sisyphus that would thee wound!\nToo long hast thou been fixed in grim repose,III\nHeightening the haughty malice of thy foes,\nThat, while thou porest by the sullen sea,\nThrough breezy glades advanceth fearlessly,\nA mounting blaze with crackling laughter fed\nFrom myriad throats; whence pain and sorrow bred\nWithin my bosom are establishèd.\nEnter TECMESSA.\nTECMESSA. Helpers of Aias’ vessel’s speed,\nErechtheus’ earth-derivèd seed,\nSorrows are ours who truly care\nFor the house of Telamon afar.\nThe dread, the grand, the rugged form\nOf him we know,\nIs stricken with a troublous storm;\nOur Aias’ glory droopeth low.\nCHORUS. What burden through the darkness fell\nWhere still at eventide ’twas well?\nPhrygian Teleutas’ daughter, say;\nSince Aias, foremost in the fray,\nDisdaining not the spear-won bride,\nStill holds thee nearest at his side,\nAnd thou may’st solve our doubts aright.\nTEC. How shall I speak the dreadful word?\nHow shall ye live when ye have heard?\nMadness hath seized our lord by night\nAnd blasted him with hopeless blight.\nSuch horrid victims mightst thou see\nHuddled beneath yon canopy,\nTorn by red hands and dyed in blood,\nDread offerings to his direful mood.\nCH. What news of our fierce lord thy story showeth,1\nSharp to endure, impossible to fly!\nNews that on tongues of Danaäns hourly groweth,\nWhich Rumour’s myriad voices multiply!\n[page 50][227-266]Alas! the approaching doom awakes my terror.\nThe man will die, disgraced in open day,\nWhose dark dyed steel hath dared through mad brained error\nThe mounted herdmen with their herds to slay.\nTEC. O horror! Then ’twas there he found\nThe flock he brought as captives tied,\nAnd some he slew upon the ground,\nAnd some, side smiting, sundered wide\nTwo white foot rams he backward drew,\nAnd bound. Of one he shore and threw\nThe tipmost tongue and head away,\nThe other to an upright stay\nHe tied, and with a harness thong\nDoubled in hand, gave whizzing blows,\nEchoing his lashes with a song\nMore dire than mortal fury knows.\nCH. Ah! then ’tis time, our heads in mantles hiding,2\nOur feet on some stol’n pathway now to ply,\nOr with swift oarage o’er the billows gliding,\nWith ordered stroke to make the good ship fly\nSuch threats the Atridae, armed with two fold power,\nLaunch to assail us. Oh, I sadly fear\nStones from fierce hands on us and him will shower,\nWhose heavy plight no comfort may come near.\nTEC. ’Tis changed, his rage, like sudden blast,\nWithout the lightning gleam is past\nAnd now that Reason’s light returns,\nNew sorrow in his spirit burns.\nFor when we look on self made woe,\nIn which no hand but ours had part,\nThought of such griefs and whence they flow\nBrings aching misery to the heart.\nCH. If he hath ceased to rave, he should do well\nThe account of evil lessens when ’tis past.\nTEC. If choice were given you, would you rather choose\nHurting your friends, yourself to feel delight,\n[page 51][267-302]Or share with them in one commingled pain?\nCH. The two fold trouble is more terrible.\nTEC. Then comes our torment now the fit is o’er.\nCH. How mean’st thou by that word? I fail to see.\nTEC. He in his rage had rapture of delight\nAnd knew not how he grieved us who stood near\nAnd saw the madding tempest ruining him.\nBut now ’tis over and he breathes anew,\nThe counterblast of sorrow shakes his soul,\nWhilst our affliction vexeth as before,\nHave we not double for our single woe?\nCH. I feel thy reasoning move me, and I fear\nSome heavenly stroke hath fallen. How else, when the end\nOf stormy sickness brings no cheering ray?\nTEC. Our state is certain. Dream not but ’tis so.\nCH. How first began the assault of misery?\nTell us the trouble, for we share the pain.\nTEC. It toucheth you indeed, and ye shall hear\nAll from the first. ’Twas midnight, and the lamp\nOf eve had died, when, seizing his sharp blade,\nHe sought on some vain errand to creep forth.\nI broke in with my word: ‘Aias, what now?\nWhy thus uncalled for salliest thou? No voice\nOf herald summoned thee. No trumpet blew.\nWhat wouldst thou when the camp is hushed in sleep?’\nHe with few words well known to women’s ears\nChecked me: ‘The silent partner is the best.’\nI saw how ’twas and ceased. Forth then he fared\nAlone—What horror passed upon the plain\nThis night, I know not. But he drags within,\nTied in a throng, bulls, shepherd dogs, and spoil\nOf cattle and sheep. Anon he butchers them,\nFelling or piercing, hacking or tearing wide,\nRibs from breast, limb from limb. Others in rage\nHe seized and bound and tortured, brutes for men.\nLast, out he rushed before the doors, and there\nWhirled forth wild language to some shadowy form,\nFlouting the generals and Laërtes’ son\n[page 52][303-341]With torrent laughter and loud triumphing\nWhat in his raid he had wreaked to their despite.\nThen diving back within—the fitful storm\nSlowly assuaging left his spirit clear.\nAnd when his eye had lightened through the room\nCumbered with ruin, smiting on his brow\nHe roared; and, tumbling down amid the wreck\nOf woolly carnage he himself had made,\nSate with clenched hand tight twisted in his hair.\nLong stayed he so in silence. Then flashed forth\nThose frightful words of threatening vehemence,\nThat bade me show him all the night’s mishap,\nAnd whither he was fallen I, dear my friends,\nPrevailed on through my fear, told all I knew.\nAnd all at once he raised a bitter cry,\nWhich heretofore I ne’er had heard, for still\nHe made us think such doleful utterance\nBetokened the dull craven spirit, and still\nDumb to shrill wailings, he would only moan\nWith half heard muttering, like an angry bull.\nBut now, by such dark fortune overpowered,\nFoodless and dry, amid the quivering heap\nHis steel hath quelled, all quietly he broods;\nAnd out of doubt his mind intends some harm:\nSuch words, such groans, burst from him. O my friends.—\nTherefore I hastened,—enter and give aid\nIf aught ye can! Men thus forgone will oft\nGrow milder through the counsel of a friend.\nCH. Teleutas’ child! we shudder at thy tale\nThat fatal frenzy wastes our hero’s soul.\nAIAS (within). Woe’s me, me, me!\nTEC. More cause anon! Hear ye not Aias there,\nHow sharp the cry that shrills from him?\nAI. Woe! Woe!\nCH. Madly it sounds—Or springs it of deep grief\nFor proofs of madness harrowing to his eye?\nAI. Boy, boy!\nTEC. What means he? Oh, Eurysakes!\nHe cries on thee. Where art thou? O my heart!\n[page 53][342-376]AI. Teucer I call! Where ’s Teucer? Will he ne’er\nCome from the chase, but leave me to my doom?\nCH. Not madness now. Disclose him. Let us look.\nHaply the sight of us may calm his soul.\nTEC. There, then; I open to your view the form\nOf Aias, and his fortunes as they are.[AIAS is discovered\nAI. Dear comrades of the deep, whose truth and loveI 1\nStand forth alone unbroken in my woe,\nBehold what gory sea\nOf storm-lashed agony\nDoth round and round me flow!\nCH. (to TEC.). Too true thy witness: for the fact cries out\nWild thoughts were here and Reason’s lamp extinct.\nAI. Strong helpers of sea-speed, whose nimble handI 2\nPlied hither the salt oar with circling stroke,\nNo shepherd there was found\nTo give the avenging wound.\nCome, lay me with the flock!\nCH.

Child of Laërtes old,II 2\nThou that dost still behold\nAnd still contrive all shapes of monstrous ill,\nWinding in foulest ways\nThrough the army’s sinful maze,—\nNow even for pleasure thou may’st laugh thy fill.\nCH.

This mad prey\nShames me for evermore:\nVengeance is at the door;\nYea, all the Achaean host, with armèd hand,\nIs ready at command\nTo slay me o’er and o’er.\n[page 55][410-447]TEC.

Grey firths of foaming brine,III 2 And ye, deep groves, that crown\nThe sea-caves and long cliffs upon the shore,\nToo long did ye confine\nMy life about the walls of Troia’s town:\nBut no more now! a breathing man, no more!\nThe wise in heart may duly learn that lore.\nLet Xanthus know,\nWhose waters neighbouring flow,\nAnd minister to Argive men:\nOne man he ne’er shall see again;\nOne, I will vaunt it forth!\nHighest in warlike worth\nOf all Greek forms that Troia’s towers have eyed:\nNow, shorn of all that pride,\nI lie thus low.\nCH. I know not how to let thee speak, nor how\nTo silence thee. Such evils close thee round.\nAI. Ay me!\nCould human thought have prophesied\nMy name would thus give echo to mine ill?\n‘Ai’ now for Aias, doubly, trebly said,\nSorts all too well to mark my misery;\nWhose father from this land of Troy, as noblest\nOf all the host, carrying the fairest prize,\nCame girt about with glory to his home.\nBut I his son, not less of might than he,\nNor poorer in the achievements of my hand,\nTo this same region following in my prime,\nAm scouted by the Achaeans and destroyed.\nYet know I one thing well. Had Peleus’ child,\nLiving, adjudged his armour as a meed\nOf well-tried bravery, no grasp save mine\nHad clutched it. But the Atridae with mean craft\nConveyed his heirloom to a wit-proud knave,\nWhilst Aias’ peerless prowess was despised.\nAnd had not this mine eye and mind distraught\n[page 56][448-486]Glanced from my purpose, ne’er again had they\nPerverted judgement. But the invincible\nStern daughter of the Highest, with baneful eye,\nEven as mine arm descended, baffled me,\nAnd hurled upon my soul a frenzied plague,\nTo stain my hand with these dumb victims’ blood.\nAnd those mine enemies exult in safety,—\nNot with my will; but where a God misguides,\nStrong arms are thwarted and the weakling lives.\nNow, what remains? Heaven hates me, ’tis too clear:\nThe Grecian host abhor me: Troy, with all\nThis country round our camp, is my sworn foe.\nShall I, across the Aegean sailing home,\nLeave these Atridae and their fleet forlorn?\nHow shall I dare to front my father’s eye?\nHow will he once endure to look on me,\nDenuded of the prize of high renown,\nWhose coronal stood sparkling on his brow?\nNo! ’twere too dreadful. Then shall I advance\nBefore the Trojan battlements, and there\nIn single conflict doing valiantly\nLast die upon their spears? Nay, for by this\nI might perchance make Atreus’ offspring glad.\nThat may not be imagined. I must find\nSome act to let my grey-haired father feel\nNo heartless recreant once called him sire.\nShame on the wight who when beset with ill\nCares to live on in misery unrelieved.\nCan hour outlasting hour make less or more\nOf death? Whereby then can it furnish joy?\nThat mortal weighs for nothing-worth with me,\nWhom Hope can comfort with her fruitless fire.\nHonour in life or honour in the grave\nBefits the noble heart. You hear my will.\nCH. From thine own spirit, Aias, all may tell,\nThat utterance came, and none have prompted thee.\nYet stay thy hurrying thought, and by thy friends\nBe ruled to loose this burden from thy mind.\nTEC. O my great master! heaviest of all woe\nIs theirs whose life is crushed beyond recall.\n[page 57][487-526]I, born of one the mightiest of the free\nAnd wealthiest in the Phrygian land, am now\nA captive. So Heaven willed, and thy strong arm\nDetermined. Therefore, since the hour that made\nMy being one with thine, I breathe for thee;\nAnd I beseech thee by the sacred fire\nOf home, and by the sweetness of the night\nWhen from thy captive I became thy bride,\nLeave me not guardless to the unworthy touch\nAnd cruel taunting of thine enemies’\nFor, shouldst thou die and leave us, then shall I\nBorne off by Argive violence with thy boy\nEat from that day the bread of slavery.\nAnd some one of our lords shall smite me there\nWith galling speech: Behold the concubine\nOf Aias, first of all the Greeks for might,\nHow envied once, worn with what service now!\nSo will they speak; and while my quailing heart\nShall sink beneath its burden, clouds of shame\nWill dim thy glory and degrade thy race.\nOh! think but of thy father, left to pine\nIn doleful age, and let thy mother’s grief—\nWho, long bowed down with many a careful year,\nPrays oftentimes thou may’st return alive—\nO’er awe thee. Yea, and pity thine own son,\nUnsheltered in his boyhood, lorn of thee,\nWith bitter foes to tend his orphanhood,\nThink, O my lord, what sorrow in thy death\nThou send’st on him and me. For I have nought\nTo lean to but thy life. My fatherland\nThy spear hath ruined. Fate—not thou—hath sent\nMy sire and mother to the home of death\nWhat wealth have I to comfort me for thee?\nWhat land of refuge? Thou art all my stay\nOh, of me too take thought! Shall men have joy,\nAnd not remember? Or shall kindness fade?\nSay, can the mind be noble, where the stream\nOf gratitude is withered from the spring?\nCH. Aias, I would thy heart were touched like mine\nWith pity; then her words would win thy praise.\n[page 58][527-565]AI. My praise she shall not miss, if she perform\nMy bidding with firm heart, and fail not here.\nTEC. Dear Aias, I will fail in nought thou bidst me.\nAI. Bring me my boy, that I may see his face.\nTEC. Oh, in my terror I conveyed him hence!\nAI. Clear of this mischief, mean’st thou? or for what?\nTEC. Lest he might run to thee, poor child, and die.\nAI. That issue had been worthy of my fate!\nTEC. But I kept watch to fence his life from harm.\nAI. ’Twas wisely done. I praise thy foresight there.\nTEC. Well, since ’tis so, how can I help thee now?\nAI. Give me to speak to him and see him near.\nTEC. He stands close by with servants tending him.\nAI. Then why doth he not come, but still delay?\nTEC. Thy father calls thee, child. Come, lead him hither,\nWhichever of you holds him by the hand.\nAI. Moves he? or do thine accents idly fall?\nTEC. See, where thy people bring him to thine eye.\nAI. Lift him to me: lift him! He will not fear\nAt sight of this fresh havoc of the sword,\nIf rightly he be fathered of my blood.\nLike some young colt he must be trained and taught\nTo run fierce courses with his warrior sire.\nBe luckier than thy father, boy! but else\nBe like him, and thy life will not be low.\nOne thing even now I envy thee, that none\nOf all this misery pierces to thy mind.\nFor life is sweetest in the void of sense,\nEre thou know joy or sorrow. But when this\nHath found thee, make thy father’s enemies\nFeel the great parent in the valiant child.\nMeantime grow on in tender youthfulness,\nNursed by light breezes, gladdening this thy mother.\nNo Greek shall trample thee with brutal harm,\nThat I know well, though I shall not be near—\nSo stout a warder to protect thy life\nI leave in Teucer. He’ll not fail, though now\nHe follow far the chase upon his foes.\nMy trusty warriors, people of the sea,\n[page 59][566-596]Be this your charge, no less,—and bear to him\nMy clear commandment, that he take this boy\nHome to my fatherland, and make him known\nTo Telamon, and Eriboea too,\nMy mother. Let him tend them in their age.\nAnd, for mine armour, let not that be made\nThe award of Grecian umpires or of him\nWho ruined me. But thou, named of the shield,\nEurysakes, hold mine, the unpierceable\nSeven-hided buckler, and by the well stitched thong\nGrasp firm and wield it mightily.—The rest\nShall lie where I am buried.—Take him now,\nQuickly, and close the door. No tears! What! weep\nBefore the tent? How women crave for pity!\nMake fast, I say. No wise physician dreams\nWith droning charms to salve a desperate sore.\nCH. There sounds a vehement ardour in thy words\nThat likes me not. I fear thy sharpened tongue.\nTEC. Aias, my lord, what act is in thy mind?\nAI. Inquire not, question not; be wise, thou’rt best.\nTEC. How my heart sinks! Oh, by thy child, by Heaven,\nI pray thee on my knees, forsake us not!\nAI. Thou troublest me. What! know’st thou not that Heaven\nHath ceased to be my debtor from to-day?\nTEC. Hush! Speak not so.\nAI. Speak thou to those that hear.\nTEC. Will you not hear me?\nAI. Canst thou not be still?\nTEC. My fears, my fears!\nAI. (to the Attendants). Come, shut me in, I say.\nTEC.

Friends, my first news is Teucer’s presence here,\nFresh from the Mysian heights; who, as he came\nRight toward the generals’ quarter, was assailed\nWith outcry from the Argives in a throng:\nFor when they knew his motion from afar\nThey swarmed around him, and with shouts of blame\nFrom each side one and all assaulted him\nAs brother to the man who had gone mad\nAnd plotted ’gainst the host,—threatening aloud,\nSpite of his strength, he should be stoned, and die.\n—So far strife ran, that swords unscabbarded\nCrossed blades, till as it mounted to the height\nAge interposed with counsel, and it fell.\nBut where is Aias to receive my word?\nTidings are best told to the rightful ear.\nCH. Not in the hut, but just gone forth, preparing\nNew plans to suit his newly altered mind.\nMESS. Alas!\nToo tardy then was he who sped me hither;\nOr I have proved too slow a messenger.\nCH. What point is lacking for thine errand’s speed?\nMESS. Teucer was resolute the man should bide\nClose held within-doors till himself should come.\nCH. Why, sure his going took the happiest turn\nAnd wisest, to propitiate Heaven’s high wrath.\nMESS. The height of folly lives in such discourse,\nIf Calchas have the wisdom of a seer.\nCH. What knowest thou of our state? What saith he? Tell.\nMESS. I can tell only what I heard and saw.\nWhilst all the chieftains and the Atridae twain\nWere seated in a ring, Calchas alone\nRose up and left them, and in Teucer’s palm\nLaid his right hand full friendly; then out-spake\nWith strict injunction by all means i’ the world\nTo keep beneath yon covert this one day\nYour hero, and not suffer him to rove,\n[page 64][755-789]If he would see him any more alive.\nFor through this present light—and ne’er again—-\nHoly Athena, so he said, will drive him\nBefore her anger. Such calamitous woe\nStrikes down the unprofitable growth that mounts\nBeyond his measure and provokes the sky.\n‘Thus ever,’ said the prophet, ‘must he fall\nWho in man’s mould hath thoughts beyond a man.\nAnd Aias, ere he left his father’s door,\nMade foolish answer to his prudent sire.\n‘My son,’ said Telamon, ‘choose victory\nAlways, but victory with an aid from Heaven.’\nHow loftily, how madly, he replied!\n‘Father, with heavenly help men nothing worth\nMay win success. But I am confident\nWithout the Gods to pluck this glory down.’\nSo huge the boast he vaunted! And again\nWhen holy Pallas urged him with her voice\nTo hurl his deadly spear against the foe,\nHe turned on her with speech of awful sound:\n‘Goddess, by other Greeks take thou thy stand;\nWhere I keep rank, the battle ne’er shall break.’\nSuch words of pride beyond the mortal scope\nHave won him Pallas’ wrath, unlovely meed.\nBut yet, perchance, so be it he live to-day,\nWe, with Heaven’s succour, may restore his peace.’—\nThus far the prophet, when immediately\nTeucer dispatched me, ere the assembly rose,\nBearing to thee this missive to be kept\nWith all thy care. But if my speed be lost,\nAnd Calchas’ word have power, the man is dead.\nCH.

Thy case I know not; but of Aias this,\nThat if he roam abroad, ’tis dangerous.\nTEC. He is, indeed, abroad.

Didst thou then perceive\nDead Hector was at length to be thine end?—\nI pray you all, consider these two men.\nHector, whose gift from Aias was a girdle,\nTight-braced therewith to the car’s rim, was dragged\nAnd scarified till he breathed forth his life.\nAnd Aias with this present from his foe\nFinds through such means his death-fall and his doom.\nSay then what cruel workman forged the gifts,\nBut Fury this sharp sword, Hell that bright band?\nIn this, and all things human, I maintain,\nGods are the artificers. My thought is said.\nAnd if there be who cares not for my thought,\nLet him hold fast his faith and leave me mine.\nCH. Spare longer speech, and think how to secure\nThy brother’s burial, and what plea will serve;\nSince one comes here hath no good will to us\nAnd like a villain haply comes in scorn.\nTEU. What man of all the host hath caught thine eye?\nCH. The cause for whom we sailed, the Spartan King.\nTEU. Yes; I discern him, now he moves more near.\n[page 72][1047-1083]\nEnter MENELAUS.\nMENELAUS. Fellow, give o’er. Cease tending yon dead man!\nObey my voice, and leave him where he lies.\nTEU. Thy potent cause for spending so much breath?\nMEN. My will, and his whose word is sovereign here.\nTEU. May we not know the reasons of your will?\nMEN. Because he, whom we trusted to have brought\nTo lend us loyal help with heart and hand,\nProved in the trial a worse than Phrygian foe;\nWho lay in wait for all the host by night,\nAnd sallied forth in arms to shed our blood;\nThat, had not one in Heaven foiled this attempt,\nOur lot had been to lie as he doth here\nDead and undone for ever, while he lived\nAnd flourished. Heaven hath turned this turbulence\nTo fall instead upon the harmless flock.\nWherefore no strength of man shall once avail\nTo encase his body with a seemly tomb,\nBut outcast on the wide and watery sand,\nHe’ll feed the birds that batten on the shore.\nNor let thy towering spirit therefore rise\nIn threatening wrath. Wilt thou or not, our hand\nShall rule him dead, howe’er he braved us living,\nAnd that by force; for never would he yield,\nEven while he lived, to words from me. And yet\nIt shows base metal when the subject-wight\nDeigns not to hearken to the chief in power.\nSince without settled awe, neither in states\nCan laws have rightful sway, nor can a host\nBe governed with due wisdom, if no fear\nOr wholesome shame be there to shield its safety.\nAnd though a man wax great in thews and bulk,\nLet him be warned: a trifling harm may ruin him.\nWhoever knows respect and honour both\nStands free from risk of dark vicissitude.\nBut whereso pride and licence have their fling,\nBe sure that state will one day lose her course\nAnd founder in the abysm. Let fear have place\n[page 73][1084-1122]Still where it ought, say I, nor let men think\nTo do their pleasure and not bide the pain.\nThat wheel comes surely round. Once Aias flamed\nWith insolent fierceness. Now I mount in pride,\nAnd loudly bid thee bury him not, lest burying\nThy brother thou be burrowing thine own grave.\nCH. Menelaüs, make not thy philosophy\nA platform whence to insult the valiant dead.\nTEU. I nevermore will marvel, sirs, when one\nOf humblest parentage is prone to sin,\nSince those reputed men of noble strain\nStoop to such phrase of prating frowardness.\nCome, tell it o’er again,—said you ye brought\nMy brother bound to aid you with his power?\nSailed he not forth of his own sovereign will?\nWhere is thy voucher of command o’er him?\nWhere of thy right o’er those that followed him?\nSparta, not we, shall buckle to thy sway.\n’Twas written nowhere in the bond of rule\nThat thou shouldst check him rather than he thee.\nThou sailedst under orders, not in charge\nOf all, much less of Aias. Then pursue\nThy limited direction, and chastise,\nIn haughty phrase, the men who fear thy nod.\nBut I will bury Aias, whether thou\nOr the other general give consent or no.\n’Tis not for me to tremble at your word.\nNot to reclaim thy wife, like those poor souls\nThou flll’st with labour, issued this man forth,\nBut caring for his oath, and not for thee,\nOr any other nobody. Then come\nWith heralds all arow, and bring the man\nCalled king of men with thee! For thy sole noise\nI budge not, wert thou twenty times thy name.\nCH. The sufferer should not bear a bitter tongue.\nHard words, how just soe’er, will leave their sting.\nMEN. Our bowman carries no small pride, I see.\nTEU. No mere mechanic’s menial craft is mine.\nMEN. How wouldst thou vaunt it hadst thou but a shield!\n[page 74][1123-1158]TEU. Unarmed I fear not thee in panoply.\nMEN. Redoubted is the wrath lives on thy tongue.\nTEU. Whose cause is just hath licence to be proud.\nMEN. Just, that my murderer have a peaceful end?\nTEU. Thy murderer? Strange, to have been slain and live!\nMEN. Yea, through Heaven’s mercy. By his will, I am dead.\nTEU. If Heaven have saved thee, give the Gods their due.\nMEN. Am I the man to spurn at Heaven’s command?\nTEU. Thou dost, to come and frustrate burial.\nMEN. Honour forbids to yield my foe a tomb.\nTEU. And Aias was thy foeman? Where and when?\nMEN. Hate lived between us; that thou know’st full well.\nTEU. For thy proved knavery, coining votes i’ the court\nMEN. The judges voted. He ne’er lost through me.\nTEU. Guilt hiding guile wears often fairest front.\nMEN. I know whom pain shall harass for that word.\nTEU. Not without giving equal pain, ’tis clear.\nMEN. No more, but this. No burial for this man!\nTEU. Yea, this much more. He shall have instant burial.\nMEN. I have seen ere now a man of doughty tongue\nUrge sailors in foul weather to unmoor,\nWho, caught in the sea-misery by and by,\nLay voiceless, muffled in his cloak, and suffered\nWho would of the sailors over trample him\nEven so methinks thy truculent mouth ere long\nShall quench its outcry, when this little cloud\nBreaks forth on thee with the full tempest’s might.\nTEU. I too have seen a man whose windy pride\nPoured forth loud insults o’er a neighbour’s fall,\nTill one whose cause and temper showed like mine\nSpake to him in my hearing this plain word:\n‘Man, do the dead no wrong; but, if thou dost,\nBe sure thou shalt have sorrow.’ Thus he warned\nThe infatuate one: ay, one whom I behold,\n[page 75][1158-1185]For all may read my riddle—thou art he.\nMEN. I will be gone. ’Twere shame to me, if known,\nTo chide when I have power to crush by force.\nTEU.

Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nAntigone, daughter of Oedipus, the late king of Thebes, in defiance of Creon who rules in his stead, resolves to bury her brother Polyneices, slain in his attack on Thebes. She is caught in the act by Creon’s watchmen and brought before the king. She justifies her action, asserting that she was bound to obey the eternal laws of right and wrong in spite of any human ordinance. Creon, unrelenting, condemns her to be immured in a rock-hewn chamber. His son Haemon, to whom Antigone is betrothed, pleads in vain for her life and threatens to die with her. Warned by the seer Teiresias Creon repents him and hurries to release Antigone from her rocky prison. But he is too late: he finds lying side by side Antigone who had hanged herself and Haemon who also has perished by his own hand. Returning to the palace he sees within the dead body of his queen who on learning of her son’s death has stabbed herself to the heart.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE—daughters of Oedipus and sisters of Polyneices and Eteocles.\nCREON, King of Thebes.\nHAEMON, Son of Creon, betrothed to Antigone.\nEURYDICE, wife of Creon.\nTEIRESIAS, the prophet.\nCHORUS, of Theban elders.\nA WATCHMAN\nA MESSENGER\nA SECOND MESSENGER\nANTIGONE\nANTIGONE and ISMENE before the Palace gates.\nANTIGONE.\nIsmene, sister of my blood and heart,\nSee’st thou how Zeus would in our lives fulfill\nThe weird of Oedipus, a world of woes!\nFor what of pain, affliction, outrage, shame,\nIs lacking in our fortunes, thine and mine?\nAnd now this proclamation of today\nMade by our Captain-General to the State,\nWhat can its purport be? Didst hear and heed,\nOr art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?\nISMENE.\nTo me, Antigone, no word of friends\nHas come, or glad or grievous, since we twain\nWere reft of our two brethren in one day\nBy double fratricide; and since i’ the night\nOur Argive leaguers fled, no later news\nHas reached me, to inspirit or deject.\nANTIGONE.\nI know ’twas so, and therefore summoned thee\nBeyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.\nISMENE.\nWhat is it? Some dark secret stirs thy breast.\nANTIGONE.\nWhat but the thought of our two brothers dead,\nThe one by Creon graced with funeral rites,\nThe other disappointed?

I perforce obey\nThe powers that be. ’Tis foolishness, I ween,\nTo overstep in aught the golden mean.\nANTIGONE.\nI urge no more; nay, wert thou willing still,\nI would not welcome such a fellowship.\nGo thine own way; myself will bury him.\nHow sweet to die in such employ, to rest,—\nSister and brother linked in love’s embrace—\nA sinless sinner, banned awhile on earth,\nBut by the dead commended; and with them\nI shall abide for ever.

For myself, I call\nTo witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,\nIf I perceive some mischievous design\nTo sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;\nNor would I reckon as my private friend\nA public foe, well knowing that the State\nIs the good ship that holds our fortunes all:\nFarewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.\nSuch is the policy by which I seek\nTo serve the Commons and conformably\nI have proclaimed an edict as concerns\nThe sons of Oedipus; Eteocles\nWho in his country’s battle fought and fell,\nThe foremost champion—duly bury him\nWith all observances and ceremonies\nThat are the guerdon of the heroic dead.\nBut for the miscreant exile who returned\nMinded in flames and ashes to blot out\nHis father’s city and his father’s gods,\nAnd glut his vengeance with his kinsmen’s blood,\nOr drag them captive at his chariot wheels—\nFor Polyneices ’tis ordained that none\nShall give him burial or make mourn for him,\nBut leave his corpse unburied, to be meat\nFor dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.\nSo am I purposed; never by my will\nShall miscreants take precedence of true men,\nBut all good patriots, alive or dead,\nShall be by me preferred and honored.\nCHORUS.\nSon of Menoeceus, thus thou will’st to deal\nWith him who loathed and him who loved our State.\nThy word is law; thou canst dispose of us\nThe living, as thou will’st, as of the dead.\nCREON.\nSee then ye execute what I ordain.\nCHORUS.\nOn younger shoulders lay this grievous charge.\nCREON.\nFear not, I’ve posted guards to watch the corpse.\nCHORUS.\nWhat further duty would’st thou lay on us?\nCREON.\nNot to connive at disobedience.\nCHORUS.\nNo man is mad enough to court his death.\nCREON.\nThe penalty is death: yet hope of gain\nHath lured men to their ruin oftentimes.\n[Enter GUARD]\nGUARD.\nMy lord, I will not make pretense to pant\nAnd puff as some light-footed messenger.\nIn sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought\nMade many a halt and turned and turned again;\nFor conscience plied her spur and curb by turns.\n“Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?”\nShe whispered. Then again, “If Creon learn\nThis from another, thou wilt rue it worse.”\nThus leisurely I hastened on my road;\nMuch thought extends a furlong to a league.\nBut in the end the forward voice prevailed,\nTo face thee. I will speak though I say nothing.\nFor plucking courage from despair methought,\n‘Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.’\nCREON.\nWhat is thy news? Why this despondency?\nGUARD.\nLet me premise a word about myself?\nI neither did the deed nor saw it done,\nNor were it just that I should come to harm.\nCREON.\nThou art good at parry, and canst fence about\nSome matter of grave import, as is plain.\nGUARD.\nThe bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.\nCREON.\nThen, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.\nGUARD.\nWell, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone\nE’en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,\nPerformed the proper ritual—and was gone.\nCREON.\nWhat say’st thou? Who hath dared to do this thing?\nGUARD.\nI cannot tell, for there was ne’er a trace\nOf pick or mattock—hard unbroken ground,\nWithout a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,\nNo sign that human hands had been at work.\nWhen the first sentry of the morning watch\nGave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.\nThe corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,\nBut strewn with dust, as if by one who sought\nTo avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:\nOf hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.\nThereat arose an angry war of words;\nGuard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,\nFor none was there to part us, each in turn\nSuspected, but the guilt brought home to none,\nFrom lack of evidence. We challenged each\nThe ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,\nOr pass through fire, affirming on our oath\nOur innocence—we neither did the deed\nOurselves, nor know who did or compassed it.\nOur quest was at a standstill, when one spake\nAnd bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,\nFor there was no gainsaying him nor way\nTo escape perdition: Yeareboundtotell\nTheKing,yecannothideit; so he spake.\nAnd he convinced us all; so lots were cast,\nAnd I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.\nSo here I am unwilling and withal\nUnwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.\nCHORUS.\nI had misgivings from the first, my liege,\nOf something more than natural at work.\nCREON.\nO cease, you vex me with your babblement;\nI am like to think you dote in your old age.\nIs it not arrant folly to pretend\nThat gods would have a thought for this dead man?\nDid they forsooth award him special grace,\nAnd as some benefactor bury him,\nWho came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,\nTo sack their shrines, to desolate their land,\nAnd scout their ordinances? Or perchance\nThe gods bestow their favors on the bad.\nNo! no! I have long noted malcontents\nWho wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,\nMisliking these my orders, and my rule.\n’Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards\nBy bribes. Of evils current upon earth\nThe worst is money. Money ’tis that sacks\nCities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;\nWarps and seduces native innocence,\nAnd breeds a habit of dishonesty.\nBut they who sold themselves shall find their greed\nOut-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.\nYea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,\nBy Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring\nBefore my presence here the very man\nWho carried out this lawless burial,\nDeath for your punishment shall not suffice.\nHanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make\nConfession of this outrage. This will teach you\nWhat practices are like to serve your turn.\nThere are some villainies that bring no gain.\nFor by dishonesty the few may thrive,\nThe many come to ruin and disgrace.\nGUARD.\nMay I not speak, or must I turn and go\nWithout a word?—\nCREON.\nBegone! canst thou not see\nThat e’en this question irks me?\nGUARD.\nWhere, my lord?\nIs it thy ears that suffer, or thy heart?\nCREON.\nWhy seek to probe and find the seat of pain?\nGUARD.\nI gall thine ears—this miscreant thy mind.\nCREON.\nWhat an inveterate babbler! get thee gone!\nGUARD.\nBabbler perchance, but innocent of the crime.\nCREON.\nTwice guilty, having sold thy soul for gain.\nGUARD.\nAlas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.\nCREON.\nGo, quibble with thy reason. If thou fail’st\nTo find these malefactors, thou shalt own\nThe wages of ill-gotten gains is death.\n[Exit CREON]\nGUARD.\nI pray he may be found. But caught or not\n(And fortune must determine that) thou never\nShalt see me here returning; that is sure.\nFor past all hope or thought I have escaped,\nAnd for my safety owe the gods much thanks.\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nMany wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;\nOver the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,\nThrough the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;\nAnd the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay\nEver he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,\nWith breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.\n(Ant. 1)\nThe light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood\nHe traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.\nMaster of cunning he: the savage bull, and the hart\nWho roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;\nAnd the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.\n(Str. 2)\nSpeech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,\nHe hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly\nAnd the nipping airs that freeze, ’neath the open winter sky.\nHe hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;\nSafe whate’er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.\n(Ant. 2)\nPassing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,\nThat guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.\nIf he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State\nProudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate\nWhoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;\nNe’er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.\nWhat strange vision meets my eyes,\nFills me with a wild surprise?\nSure I know her, sure ’tis she,\nThe maid Antigone.\nHapless child of hapless sire,\nDidst thou recklessly conspire,\nMadly brave the King’s decree?\nTherefore are they haling thee?\n[Enter GUARD bringing ANTIGONE]\nGUARD.\nHere is the culprit taken in the act\nOf giving burial. But where’s the King?\nCHORUS.\nThere from the palace he returns in time.\n[Enter CREON]\nCREON.\nWhy is my presence timely? What has chanced?\nGUARD.\nNo man, my lord, should make a vow, for if\nHe ever swears he will not do a thing,\nHis afterthoughts belie his first resolve.\nWhen from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled\nI sware thou wouldst not see me here again;\nBut the wild rapture of a glad surprise\nIntoxicates, and so I’m here forsworn.\nAnd here’s my prisoner, caught in the very act,\nDecking the grave. No lottery this time;\nThis prize is mine by right of treasure-trove.\nSo take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.\nShe’s thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim\nHence to depart well quit of all these ills.\nCREON.\nSay, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?\nGUARD.\nBurying the man. There’s nothing more to tell.\nCREON.\nHast thou thy wits? Or know’st thou what thou say’st?\nGUARD.\nI saw this woman burying the corpse\nAgainst thy orders. Is that clear and plain?\nCREON.\nBut how was she surprised and caught in the act?\nGUARD.\nIt happened thus. No sooner had we come,\nDriven from thy presence by those awful threats,\nThan straight we swept away all trace of dust,\nAnd bared the clammy body. Then we sat\nHigh on the ridge to windward of the stench,\nWhile each man kept he fellow alert and rated\nRoundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.\nSo all night long we watched, until the sun\nStood high in heaven, and his blazing beams\nSmote us. A sudden whirlwind then upraised\nA cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,\nAnd swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,\nAnd shook the firmament. We closed our eyes\nAnd waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.\nAt last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.\nA piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,\nAs when the mother bird beholds her nest\nRobbed of its nestlings; even so the maid\nWailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,\nAnd cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.\nAnon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,\nThen, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,\nThrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.\nWe at the sight swooped down on her and seized\nOur quarry. Undismayed she stood, and when\nWe taxed her with the former crime and this,\nShe disowned nothing. I was glad—and grieved;\nFor ’tis most sweet to ’scape oneself scot-free,\nAnd yet to bring disaster to a friend\nIs grievous. Take it all in all, I deem\nA man’s first duty is to serve himself.\nCREON.\nSpeak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,\nDoes thou plead guilty or deny the deed?\nANTIGONE.\nGuilty. I did it, I deny it not.\nCREON (to GUARD)\nSirrah, begone whither thou wilt, and thank\nThy luck that thou hast ’scaped a heavy charge.\n(To ANTIGONE)\nNow answer this plain question, yes or no,\nWast thou acquainted with the interdict?\nANTIGONE.\nI knew, all knew; how should I fail to know?\nCREON.\nAnd yet wert bold enough to break the law?\nANTIGONE.\nYea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus,\nAnd she who sits enthroned with gods below,\nJustice, enacted not these human laws.\nNor did I deem that thou, a mortal man,\nCould’st by a breath annul and override\nThe immutable unwritten laws of Heaven.\nThey were not born today nor yesterday;\nThey die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang.\nI was not like, who feared no mortal’s frown,\nTo disobey these laws and so provoke\nThe wrath of Heaven. I knew that I must die,\nE’en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death\nIs thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.\nFor death is gain to him whose life, like mine,\nIs full of misery. Thus my lot appears\nNot sad, but blissful; for had I endured\nTo leave my mother’s son unburied there,\nI should have grieved with reason, but not now.\nAnd if in this thou judgest me a fool,\nMethinks the judge of folly’s not acquit.\nCHORUS.\nA stubborn daughter of a stubborn sire,\nThis ill-starred maiden kicks against the pricks.\nCREON.\nWell, let her know the stubbornest of wills\nAre soonest bended, as the hardest iron,\nO’er-heated in the fire to brittleness,\nFlies soonest into fragments, shivered through.\nA snaffle curbs the fieriest steed, and he\nWho in subjection lives must needs be meek.\nBut this proud girl, in insolence well-schooled,\nFirst overstepped the established law, and then—\nA second and worse act of insolence—\nShe boasts and glories in her wickedness.\nNow if she thus can flout authority\nUnpunished, I am woman, she the man.\nBut though she be my sister’s child or nearer\nOf kin than all who worship at my hearth,\nNor she nor yet her sister shall escape\nThe utmost penalty, for both I hold,\nAs arch-conspirators, of equal guilt.\nBring forth the older; even now I saw her\nWithin the palace, frenzied and distraught.\nThe workings of the mind discover oft\nDark deeds in darkness schemed, before the act.\nMore hateful still the miscreant who seeks\nWhen caught, to make a virtue of a crime.\nANTIGONE.\nWould’st thou do more than slay thy prisoner?\nCREON.\nNot I, thy life is mine, and that’s enough.\nANTIGONE.\nWhy dally then? To me no word of thine\nIs pleasant: God forbid it e’er should please;\nNor am I more acceptable to thee.\nAnd yet how otherwise had I achieved\nA name so glorious as by burying\nA brother? so my townsmen all would say,\nWhere they not gagged by terror, Manifold\nA king’s prerogatives, and not the least\nThat all his acts and all his words are law.\nCREON.\nOf all these Thebans none so deems but thou.\nANTIGONE.\nThese think as I, but bate their breath to thee.\nCREON.\nHast thou no shame to differ from all these?\nANTIGONE.\nTo reverence kith and kin can bring no shame.\nCREON.\nWas his dead foeman not thy kinsman too?\nANTIGONE.\nOne mother bare them and the self-same sire.\nCREON.\nWhy cast a slur on one by honoring one?\nANTIGONE.\nThe dead man will not bear thee out in this.\nCREON.\nSurely, if good and evil fare alive.\nANTIGONE.\nThe slain man was no villain but a brother.\nCREON.\nThe patriot perished by the outlaw’s brand.\nANTIGONE.\nNathless the realms below these rites require.\nCREON.\nNot that the base should fare as do the brave.\nANTIGONE.\nWho knows if this world’s crimes are virtues there?\nCREON.\nNot even death can make a foe a friend.\nANTIGONE.\nMy nature is for mutual love, not hate.\nCREON.\nDie then, and love the dead if thou must;\nNo woman shall be the master while I live.\n[Enter ISMENE]\nCHORUS.\nLo from out the palace gate,\nWeeping o’er her sister’s fate,\nComes Ismene; see her brow,\nOnce serene, beclouded now,\nSee her beauteous face o’erspread\nWith a flush of angry red.\nCREON.\nWoman, who like a viper unperceived\nDidst harbor in my house and drain my blood,\nTwo plagues I nurtured blindly, so it proved,\nTo sap my throne. Say, didst thou too abet\nThis crime, or dost abjure all privity?\nISMENE.\nI did the deed, if she will have it so,\nAnd with my sister claim to share the guilt.\nANTIGONE.\nThat were unjust. Thou would’st not act with me\nAt first, and I refused thy partnership.\nISMENE.\nBut now thy bark is stranded, I am bold\nTo claim my share as partner in the loss.\nANTIGONE.\nWho did the deed the under-world knows well:\nA friend in word is never friend of mine.\nISMENE.\nO sister, scorn me not, let me but share\nThy work of piety, and with thee die.\nANTIGONE.\nClaim not a work in which thou hadst no hand;\nOne death sufficeth.

Find’st thou pleasure in these gibes?\nANTIGONE.\n’Tis a sad mockery, if indeed I mock.\nISMENE.\nO say if I can help thee even now.\nANTIGONE.\nNo, save thyself; I grudge not thy escape.\nISMENE.\nIs e’en this boon denied, to share thy lot?\nANTIGONE.\nYea, for thou chosed’st life, and I to die.\nISMENE.\nThou canst not say that I did not protest.\nANTIGONE.\nWell, some approved thy wisdom, others mine.\nISMENE.\nBut now we stand convicted, both alike.\nANTIGONE.\nFear not; thou livest, I died long ago\nThen when I gave my life to save the dead.\nCREON.\nBoth maids, methinks, are crazed. One suddenly\nHas lost her wits, the other was born mad.\nISMENE.\nYea, so it falls, sire, when misfortune comes,\nThe wisest even lose their mother wit.\nCREON.\nI’ faith thy wit forsook thee when thou mad’st\nThy choice with evil-doers to do ill.\nISMENE.\nWhat life for me without my sister here?\nCREON.\nSay not thy sister here: thy sister’s dead.\nISMENE.\nWhat, wilt thou slay thy own son’s plighted bride?\nCREON.\nAye, let him raise him seed from other fields.\nISMENE.\nNo new espousal can be like the old.\nCREON.\nA plague on trulls who court and woo our sons.\nANTIGONE.\nO Haemon, how thy sire dishonors thee!\nCREON.\nA plague on thee and thy accursed bride!\nCHORUS.\nWhat, wilt thou rob thine own son of his bride?\nCREON.\n’Tis death that bars this marriage, not his sire.\nCHORUS.\nSo her death-warrant, it would seem, is sealed.\nCREON.\nBy you, as first by me; off with them, guards,\nAnd keep them close. Henceforward let them learn\nTo live as women use, not roam at large.\nFor e’en the bravest spirits run away\nWhen they perceive death pressing on life’s heels.\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nThrice blest are they who never tasted pain!\nIf once the curse of Heaven attaint a race,\nThe infection lingers on and speeds apace,\nAge after age, and each the cup must drain.\nSo when Etesian blasts from Thrace downpour\nSweep o’er the blackening main and whirl to land\nFrom Ocean’s cavernous depths his ooze and sand,\nBillow on billow thunders on the shore.\n(Ant. 1)\nOn the Labdacidae I see descending\nWoe upon woe; from days of old some god\nLaid on the race a malison, and his rod\nScourges each age with sorrows never ending.\nThe light that dawned upon its last born son\nIs vanished, and the bloody axe of Fate\nHas felled the goodly tree that blossomed late.\nO Oedipus, by reckless pride undone!\n(Str. 2)\nThy might, O Zeus, what mortal power can quell?\nNot sleep that lays all else beneath its spell,\nNor moons that never tire: untouched by Time,\nThroned in the dazzling light\nThat crowns Olympus’ height,\nThou reignest King, omnipotent, sublime.\nPast, present, and to be,\nAll bow to thy decree,\nAll that exceeds the mean by Fate\nIs punished, Love or Hate.\n(Ant. 2)\nHope flits about never-wearying wings;\nProfit to some, to some light loves she brings,\nBut no man knoweth how her gifts may turn,\nTill ’neath his feet the treacherous ashes burn.\nSure ’twas a sage inspired that spake this word;\nIf evil good appear\nTo any, Fate is near;\nAnd brief the respite from her flaming sword.\nHither comes in angry mood\nHaemon, latest of thy brood;\nIs it for his bride he’s grieved,\nOr her marriage-bed deceived,\nDoth he make his mourn for thee,\nMaid forlorn, Antigone?\n[Enter HAEMON]\nCREON.\nSoon shall we know, better than seer can tell.\nLearning may fixed decree anent thy bride,\nThou mean’st not, son, to rave against thy sire?\nKnow’st not whate’er we do is done in love?\nHAEMON.\nO father, I am thine, and I will take\nThy wisdom as the helm to steer withal.\nTherefore no wedlock shall by me be held\nMore precious than thy loving goverance.\nCREON.\nWell spoken: so right-minded sons should feel,\nIn all deferring to a father’s will.\nFor ’tis the hope of parents they may rear\nA brood of sons submissive, keen to avenge\nTheir father’s wrongs, and count his friends their own.\nBut who begets unprofitable sons,\nHe verily breeds trouble for himself,\nAnd for his foes much laughter.

But repeat your tale\nTo one not unacquaint with misery.\nMESSENGER.\nDear mistress, I was there and will relate\nThe perfect truth, omitting not one word.\nWhy should we gloze and flatter, to be proved\nLiars hereafter? Truth is ever best.\nWell, in attendance on my liege, your lord,\nI crossed the plain to its utmost margin, where\nThe corse of Polyneices, gnawn and mauled,\nWas lying yet. We offered first a prayer\nTo Pluto and the goddess of cross-ways,\nWith contrite hearts, to deprecate their ire.\nThen laved with lustral waves the mangled corse,\nLaid it on fresh-lopped branches, lit a pyre,\nAnd to his memory piled a mighty mound\nOf mother earth. Then to the caverned rock,\nThe bridal chamber of the maid and Death,\nWe sped, about to enter. But a guard\nHeard from that godless shrine a far shrill wail,\nAnd ran back to our lord to tell the news.\nBut as he nearer drew a hollow sound\nOf lamentation to the King was borne.\nHe groaned and uttered then this bitter plaint:\n“Am I a prophet? miserable me!\nIs this the saddest path I ever trod?\n’Tis my son’s voice that calls me. On press on,\nMy henchmen, haste with double speed to the tomb\nWhere rocks down-torn have made a gap, look in\nAnd tell me if in truth I recognize\nThe voice of Haemon or am heaven-deceived.”\nSo at the bidding of our distraught lord\nWe looked, and in the craven’s vaulted gloom\nI saw the maiden lying strangled there,\nA noose of linen twined about her neck;\nAnd hard beside her, clasping her cold form,\nHer lover lay bewailing his dead bride\nDeath-wedded, and his father’s cruelty.\nWhen the King saw him, with a terrible groan\nHe moved towards him, crying, “O my son\nWhat hast thou done? What ailed thee? What mischance\nHas reft thee of thy reason? O come forth,\nCome forth, my son; thy father supplicates.”\nBut the son glared at him with tiger eyes,\nSpat in his face, and then, without a word,\nDrew his two-hilted sword and smote, but missed\nHis father flying backwards. Then the boy,\nWroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent\nFell on his sword and drove it through his side\nHome, but yet breathing clasped in his lax arms\nThe maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined\nWith his expiring gasps. So there they lay\nTwo corpses, one in death. His marriage rites\nAre consummated in the halls of Death:\nA witness that of ills whate’er befall\nMortals’ unwisdom is the worst of all.\n[Exit EURYDICE]\nCHORUS.\nWhat makest thou of this? The Queen has gone\nWithout a word importing good or ill.\nMESSENGER.\nI marvel too, but entertain good hope.\n’Tis that she shrinks in public to lament\nHer son’s sad ending, and in privacy\nWould with her maidens mourn a private loss.\nTrust me, she is discreet and will not err.\nCHORUS.\nI know not, but strained silence, so I deem,\nIs no less ominous than excessive grief.\nMESSENGER.\nWell, let us to the house and solve our doubts,\nWhether the tumult of her heart conceals\nSome fell design. It may be thou art right:\nUnnatural silence signifies no good.\nCHORUS.\nLo! the King himself appears.\nEvidence he with him bears\n’Gainst himself (ah me! I quake\n’Gainst a king such charge to make)\nBut all must own,\nThe guilt is his and his alone.\nCREON.\n(Str. 1)\nWoe for sin of minds perverse,\nDeadly fraught with mortal curse.\nBehold us slain and slayers, all akin.\nWoe for my counsel dire, conceived in sin.\nAlas, my son,\nLife scarce begun,\nThou wast undone.\nThe fault was mine, mine only, O my son!\nCHORUS.\nToo late thou seemest to perceive the truth.\nCREON.\n(Str. 2)\nBy sorrow schooled.

Orestes, then a child, had been rescued by his sister Electra, and sent into Phocis with the one servant who remained faithful to his old master. The son of Agamemnon now returns, being of a full age, accompanied by this same attendant and his friend Pylades, with whom he has already concerted a plan for taking vengeance on his father’s murderers, in obedience to the command of Apollo.\nOrestes had been received in Phocis by Strophius, his father’s friend.

Now all in a confusèd throng\nSpared not the goad, each eager to outgo\nThe crowded axles and the snorting steeds;\nFor close about his nimbly circling wheels\nAnd stooping sides fell flakes of panted foam.\nOrestes, ever nearest at the turn,\nWith whirling axle seemed to graze the stone,\nAnd loosing with free rein the right-hand steed\nThat pulled the side-rope, held the near one in.\nSo for a time all chariots upright moved,\nBut soon the Oetaean’s hard-mouthed horses broke\nFrom all control, and wheeling as they passed\nFrom the sixth circuit to begin the seventh,\nSmote front to front against the Barcan car.\n[page 151][728-766]And when that one disaster had befallen,\nEach dashed against his neighbour and was thrown,\nTill the whole plain was strewn with chariot-wreck.\nThen the Athenian, skilled to ply the rein,\nDrew on one side, and heaving to, let pass\nThe rider-crested surge that rolled i’ the midst.\nMeanwhile Orestes, trusting to the end,\nWas driving hindmost with tight rein; but now,\nSeeing him left the sole competitor,\nHurling fierce clamour through his steeds, pursued:\nSo drave they yoke by yoke—now this, now that\nPulling ahead with car and team. Orestes,\nIll-fated one, each previous course had driven\nSafely without a check, but after this,\nIn letting loose again the left-hand rein,\nHe struck the edge of the stone before he knew,\nShattering the axle’s end, and tumbled prone,\nCaught in the reins, that dragged him with sharp thongs.\nThen as he fell to the earth the horses swerved,\nAnd roamed the field. The people when they saw\nHim fallen from out the car, lamented loud\nFor the fair youth, who had achieved before them\nSuch glorious feats, and now had found such woe,—\nDashed on the ground, then tossed with legs aloft\nAgainst the sky,—until the charioteers,\nHardly restraining the impetuous team,\nReleased him, covered so with blood that none,—\nNo friend who saw—had known his hapless form.\nWhich then we duly burned upon the pyre.\nAnd straightway men appointed to the task\nFrom all the Phocians bear his mighty frame—\nPoor ashes! narrowed in a brazen urn,—\nThat he may find in his own fatherland\nHis share of sepulture.—Such our report,\nPainful to hear, but unto us, who saw,\nThe mightiest horror that e’er met mine eye.\nCH. Alas! the stock of our old masters, then,\nIs utterly uprooted and destroyed.\nCLY. O heavens! what shall I say? That this is well?\n[page 152][767-799]Or terrible, but gainful?

O misery! ’Tis time to wail thy fate,\nOrestes, when, in thy calamity,\nThy mother thus insults thee. Is it well?\nCLY. ’Tis well that he is gone, not that you live.\nEL. Hear, ’venging spirits of the lately dead!\nCLY. The avenging spirits have heard and answered well.\nEL. Insult us now, for thou art fortunate!\nCLY. You and Orestes are to quench my pride.\nEL. Our pride is quenched. No hope of quenching thee!\nCLY. A world of good is in thy coming, stranger,\nSince thou hast silenced this all-clamorous tongue.\nOLD M. Then I may go my way, seeing all is well.\n[page 153][800-836]CLY. Nay, go not yet!

Art thou mad, unhappy one, to laugh\nOver thine own calamity and mine?\nCHR. No, by our father’s hearth, I say not this\nIn mockery. I tell you he is come.\nEL. Me miserable! Who hath given thine ear\nThe word that so hath wrought on thy belief?\nCHR. Myself am the eyewitness, no one else\nGained my belief, but proofs I clearly saw.\nEL. What sign hath so engrossed thine eye, poor girl?\nWhat sight hath fired thee with this quenchless glow?\nCHR. But list to me, I pray thee, that henceforth\nThou mayest account me clear eyed, or a fool!\nEL. By all means, if it pleasure thee, say on.\nCHR. Well, I will tell thee all I saw:—I came\nUnto the ancient tomb that holds our sire;\nAnd from the topmost mound I marked a stream\nOf milk fresh-flowing, and his resting place\nRinged round with garlands of all flowers that blow.\nI marvelled at the sight, and peered about,\nLest some one might be nearer than we knew.\nBut finding all was quiet in the spot,\nI ventured closer to the tomb, and there,\nHard by the limit, I beheld a curl\nOf hair new shorn, with all the gloss of youth\nAnd straight it struck my heart, as with a sense\nOf something seen, ah me! long, long ago,\nAnd told me that my sight encountered here\nThe token of Orestes, dearest soul\nThen, clasping it, I did not cry aloud,\nBut straight mine eyes were filled with tears of joy.\n[page 156][907-943]And now as much as then I feel assured\nHe and none else bestowed this ornament.\nTo whom beyond thyself and me belongs\nSuch consecration? And I know this well,\nI did it not,—nor thou. Impossible!\nThou canst not worship even the blessèd Gods\nForth of this roof, unpunished. And, most sure,\nOur mother is not minded so to act,\nNor, had she done it, could we fail to know.\nThis offering comes then of Orestes’ hand.\nTake courage, dear one. Not one fate pursues\nOne house perpetually, but changeth still.\nOurs was a sullen Genius, but perchance\nThis day begins the assurance of much good.\nEL. Oh how I pity thine infatuate mind!\nCHR. Why? Dost thou find no comfort in my news?\nEL. You know not where you roam. Far wide! far wide!\nCHR. Not know? when I have seen it with mine eyes?\nEL. Dear, he is dead. Look not to him, poor girl!\nSalvation comes to thee no more from him.\nCHR. Oh me, unfortunate! Who told thee this?\nEL. He who stood by and saw his life destroyed.\nCHR. Amazement seizes me. Where is that man?\nEL. Right welcome to the mother there within.\nCHR. Me miserable! Who then can have decked\nWith all those ceremonies our father’s tomb?\nEL. I cannot but suppose some hand hath brought\nThese gifts in memory of Orestes dead.\nCHR. O cruel fate! While I in ecstasy\nSped with such news, all ignorant, it seems,\nOf our dire fortune; and, arriving, find\nFresh sorrows added to the former woe.\nEL. It is so, sister; yet if thou wilt list\nTo me, thou mayest disperse this heaviness.\nCHR. What? Shall I raise the dead again to life?\nEL. I did not mean so. I am not so fond.\nCHR. What bid you then that I have power to do?\nEL. To endure courageously what I enjoin.\n[page 157][944-981]CHR. So it make profit, I will not refuse.\nEL. Remember, without toil no plan may thrive!\nCHR. I know it, and will aid thee to my power.\nEL. Then hearken my resolve. Thou seëst now,\nWe have no friendly succour in the world;\nBut death has taken all, and we are left\nTwo only. I, so long as I could hear\nMy brother lived and flourished, still had hope\nHe would arise to wreak his father’s blood.\nBut now that he is gone, to thee I turn,\nTo help thy sister boldly to destroy\nThe guilty author of our father’s death,\nAegisthus.—Wherefore hide it from thee now?\n—Yea, sister! Till what term wilt thou remain\nInactive? To what end? What hope is yet\nLeft standing? Surely thou hast cause to grieve,\nBobbed of thy father’s opulent heritage,\nAnd feeling bitterly the creeping years\nThat find thee still a virgin and unwed.\nNay, nor imagine thou shalt ever know\nThat blessing. Not so careless of his life\nIs King Aegisthus, as to risk the birth\nOf sons from us, to his most certain fall.\nBut if thou wilt but follow my resolve,\nFirst thou shalt win renown of piety\nFrom our dead father, and our brother too,\nWho rest beneath the ground, and shalt be free\nFor evermore in station as in birth,\nAnd nobly matched in marriage, for the good\nDraw gazers to them still. Then seest thou not\nWhat meed of honour, if thou dost my will,\nThou shalt apportion to thyself and me?\nFor who, beholding us, what citizen,\nWhat foreigner, will not extend the hand\nOf admiration, and exclaim, ‘See, friends,\nThese scions of one stock, these noble twain,\nThese that have saved their father’s house from woe,\nWho once when foes were mighty, set their life\nUpon a cast, and stood forth to avenge\nThe stain of blood! Who will not love the pair\n[page 158][981-1018]And do them reverence? Who will not give\nHonour at festivals, and in the throng\nOf popular resort, to these in chief,\nFor their high courage and their bold emprise?’\nSuch fame will follow us in all the world.\nLiving or dying, still to be renowned.\nAh, then, comply, dear sister; give thy sire\nThis toil—this labour to thy brother give;\nEnd these my sufferings, end thine own regret:\nThe well-born cannot bear to live in shame.\nCH. In such affairs, for those who speak and hear\nWise thoughtfulness is still the best ally.\nCHR. True, noble women, and before she spake\nSound thought should have prevented the rash talk\nThat now hath proved her reckless. What wild aim\nBeckons thee forth in arming this design\nWhereto thou wouldst demand my ministry?\nDost not perceive, thou art not man but woman,\nOf strength inferior to thine enemies,—\nTheir Genius daily prospering more and more,\nWhilst ours is dwindling into nothingness?\nWho then that plots against a life so strong\nShall quit him of the danger without harm?\nTake heed we do not add to our distress\nShould some one hear of this our colloquy.\nSmall help and poor advantage ’twere for us\nTo win brief praise and then inglorious die.\nNay, death is not so hateful as when one\nDesiring death is balked of that desire.\nAnd I beseech thee, ere in utter ruin\nWe perish and make desolate our race,\nRefrain thy rage. And I will guard for thee\nIn silence these thy words unrealized;\nIf thou wilt learn this wisdom from long time,\nHaving no strength, to bend before the strong.\nCH. Comply. Than prudence and a heedful mind,\nNo fairer treasure can be found for men.\nEL. Thy words have not surprised me. Well I knew\nThe good I offered would come back with scorn.\n[page 159][1019-1052]I, all alone and with a single hand,\nMust do this. For it shall not rest undone.\nCHR. Would thou hadst been thus minded when our sire\nLay dying! In one act thou hadst compassed all.\nEL. My spirit was the same: my mind was less.\nCHR. Be such the life-long temper of thy mind!\nEL. Thine admonition augurs little aid.\nCHR. Yea. For the attempt would bring me certain bane.\nEL. I envy thee thy prudence, hate thy fear.\nCHR. Even when thou speak’st me fair, I will endure it.\nEL. Take heart. That never will be thine from me.\nCHR. Long time remains to settle that account.\nEL. I find no profit in thee. Go thy way.\nCHR. Profit there is, hadst thou a mind to learn.\nEL. Go to thy mother and declare all this!\nCHR. I am not so in hatred of thy life.\nEL. Yet know the shame thou wouldst prepare for me.\nCHR. No, no! Not shame, but care for thine estate.\nEL. Must I still follow as thou thinkest good?\nCHR. When thou hast wisdom, thou shalt be the guide.\nEL. ’Tis hard when error wears the garb of sense.\nCHR. Right. That is the misfortune of your case.\nEL. Why? Feel you not the justice of my speech?\nCHR. Justice may chance to bring me injury.\nEL. I care not, I, to live by such a rule.\nCHR. Well, if you do it, you will find me wise.\nEL. Well, I will do it, nought dismayed by thee.\nCHR. Speak you plain sooth? and will you not be counselled?\nEL. No, for bad counsel is of all most hateful.\nCHR. You take the sense of nothing that I say.\nEL. Long since, not newly, my resolve is firm.\nCHR. Then I will go. Thy heart will ne’er be brought\nTo praise my words, nor I thine action here.\nEL. Then go within! I will not follow thee,\n[page 160][1053-1089]Though thou desire it vehemently. None\nWould be so fond to hunt on a cold trail.\nCHR.

Nor fear\nShe should behold me with a smiling face.\nMine ancient hate of her hath sunk too deep.\nAnd from the time I saw thee, tears of joy\nWill cease not. Wherefore should I stint their flow?\nI, who in this thy coming have beheld\nThee dead and living? Strangely hast thou wrought\nOn me;—that should my father come alive,\nI would not think the sight were miracle,\nBut sober truth. Since such thy presence, then,\nLead as thy spirit prompts. For I alone\nOf two things surely had achieved one,\nNoble deliverance or a noble death.\nOR. Be silent; for I hear within the house\nA footstep coming forth.\nEL. (loudly).

    "content":"OEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nOedipus, the blind and banished King of Thebes, has come in his wanderings to Colonus, a deme of Athens, led by his daughter Antigone. He sits to rest on a rock just within a sacred grove of the Furies and is bidden depart by a passing native. But Oedipus, instructed by an oracle that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to stir, and the stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the Chorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at first the blind beggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are horror-striken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will confer on the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus. From Theseus Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil; the benefits that will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs having promised to aid and befriend him. No sooner has he gone than Creon enters with an armed guard who seize Antigone and carry her off (Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured) and he is about to lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard the tumult, hurries up and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to detain him till he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the next scene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs Oedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon wishes to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father’s forgiveness and blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to the side that Oedipus espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and invokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of thunder is heard, and as peal follows peal, Oedipus is aware that his hour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus. Self-guided he leads the way to the spot where death should overtake him, attended by Theseus and his daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell, and what followed none but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports) for the gods took him.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nOEDIPUS, banished King of Thebes.\nANTIGONE, his daughter.\nISMENE, his daughter.\nTHESEUS, King of Athens.\nCREON, brother of Jocasta, now reigning at Thebes.\nPOLYNEICES, elder son of Oedipus.\nSTRANGER, a native of Colonus.\nMESSENGER, an attendant of Theseus.\nCHORUS, citizens of Colonus.\nScene: In front of the grove of the Eumenides.\nOEDIPUS AT COLONUS\nEnter the blind OEDIPUS led by his daughter, ANTIGONE.\nOEDIPUS.\nChild of an old blind sire, Antigone,\nWhat region, say, whose city have we reached?\nWho will provide today with scanted dole\nThis wanderer? ’Tis little that he craves,\nAnd less obtains—that less enough for me;\nFor I am taught by suffering to endure,\nAnd the long years that have grown old with me,\nAnd last not least, by true nobility.\nMy daughter, if thou seest a resting place\nOn common ground or by some sacred grove,\nStay me and set me down. Let us discover\nWhere we have come, for strangers must inquire\nOf denizens, and do as they are bid.\nANTIGONE.\nLong-suffering father, Oedipus, the towers\nThat fence the city still are faint and far;\nBut where we stand is surely holy ground;\nA wilderness of laurel, olive, vine;\nWithin a choir or songster nightingales\nAre warbling.

To tell him aught or urge his coming?\nOEDIPUS.\nSay a slight service may avail him much.\nSTRANGER.\nHow can he profit from a sightless man?\nOEDIPUS.\nThe blind man’s words will be instinct with sight.\nSTRANGER.\nHeed then; I fain would see thee out of harm;\nFor by the looks, marred though they be by fate,\nI judge thee noble; tarry where thou art,\nWhile I go seek the burghers—those at hand,\nNot in the city. They will soon decide\nWhether thou art to rest or go thy way.\n[Exit STRANGER]\nOEDIPUS.\nTell me, my daughter, has the stranger gone?\nANTIGONE.\nYes, he has gone; now we are all alone,\nAnd thou may’st speak, dear father, without fear.\nOEDIPUS.\nStern-visaged queens, since coming to this land\nFirst in your sanctuary I bent the knee,\nFrown not on me or Phoebus, who, when erst\nHe told me all my miseries to come,\nSpake of this respite after many years,\nSome haven in a far-off land, a rest\nVouchsafed at last by dread divinities.\n“There,” said he, “shalt thou round thy weary life,\nA blessing to the land wherein thou dwell’st,\nBut to the land that cast thee forth, a curse.”\nAnd of my weird he promised signs should come,\nEarthquake, or thunderclap, or lightning flash.\nAnd now I recognize as yours the sign\nThat led my wanderings to this your grove;\nElse had I never lighted on you first,\nA wineless man on your seat of native rock.\nO goddesses, fulfill Apollo’s word,\nGrant me some consummation of my life,\nIf haply I appear not all too vile,\nA thrall to sorrow worse than any slave.\nHear, gentle daughters of primeval Night,\nHear, namesake of great Pallas; Athens, first\nOf cities, pity this dishonored shade,\nThe ghost of him who once was Oedipus.\nANTIGONE.\nHush! for I see some grey-beards on their way,\nTheir errand to spy out our resting-place.\nOEDIPUS.\nI will be mute, and thou shalt guide my steps\nInto the covert from the public road,\nTill I have learned their drift. A prudent man\nWill ever shape his course by what he learns.\n[Enter CHORUS]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nHa! Where is he?

Yet am I then\nA villain born because in self-defense,\nStriken, I struck the striker back again?\nE’en had I known, no villainy ’twould prove:\nBut all unwitting whither I went, I went—\nTo ruin; my destroyers knew it well,\nWherefore, I pray you, sirs, in Heaven’s name,\nEven as ye bade me quit my seat, defend me.\nO pay not a lip service to the gods\nAnd wrong them of their dues. Bethink ye well,\nThe eye of Heaven beholds the just of men,\nAnd the unjust, nor ever in this world\nHas one sole godless sinner found escape.\nStand then on Heaven’s side and never blot\nAthens’ fair scutcheon by abetting wrong.\nI came to you a suppliant, and you pledged\nYour honor; O preserve me to the end,\nO let not this marred visage do me wrong!\nA holy and god-fearing man is here\nWhose coming purports comfort for your folk.\nAnd when your chief arrives, whoe’er he be,\nThen shall ye have my story and know all.\nMeanwhile I pray you do me no despite.\nCHORUS.\nThe plea thou urgest, needs must give us pause,\nSet forth in weighty argument, but we\nMust leave the issue with the ruling powers.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere is he, strangers, he who sways the realm?\nCHORUS.\nIn his ancestral seat; a messenger,\nThe same who sent us here, is gone for him.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd think you he will have such care or thought\nFor the blind stranger as to come himself?\nCHORUS.\nAye, that he will, when once he learns thy name.\nOEDIPUS.\nBut who will bear him word!\nCHORUS.\nThe way is long,\nAnd many travelers pass to speed the news.\nBe sure he’ll hear and hasten, never fear;\nSo wide and far thy name is noised abroad,\nThat, were he ne’er so spent and loth to move,\nHe would bestir him when he hears of thee.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell, may he come with blessing to his State\nAnd me! Who serves his neighbor serves himself. 5\nANTIGONE.\nZeus! What is this? What can I say or think?\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat now, Antigone?\nANTIGONE.\nI see a woman\nRiding upon a colt of Aetna’s breed;\nShe wears for headgear a Thessalian hat\nTo shade her from the sun.

The one\nSince first she grew from girlish feebleness\nTo womanhood has been the old man’s guide\nAnd shared my weary wandering, roaming oft\nHungry and footsore through wild forest ways,\nIn drenching rains and under scorching suns,\nCareless herself of home and ease, if so\nHer sire might have her tender ministry.\nAnd thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,\nEluding the Cadmeians’ vigilance,\nTo bring thy father all the oracles\nConcerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself\nMy faithful lieger, when they banished me.\nAnd now what mission summons thee from home,\nWhat news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?\nThis much I know, thou com’st not empty-handed,\nWithout a warning of some new alarm.\nISMENE.\nThe toil and trouble, father, that I bore\nTo find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,\nI spare thee; surely ’twere a double pain\nTo suffer, first in act and then in telling;\n’Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons\nI come to tell thee.

These two maids\nTheir sisters, girls, gave all their sex could give,\nFood and safe harborage and filial care;\nWhile their two brethren sacrificed their sire\nFor lust of power and sceptred sovereignty.\nNo! me they ne’er shall win for an ally,\nNor will this Theban kingship bring them gain;\nThat know I from this maiden’s oracles,\nAnd those old prophecies concerning me,\nWhich Phoebus now at length has brought to pass.\nCome Creon then, come all the mightiest\nIn Thebes to seek me; for if ye my friends,\nChampioned by those dread Powers indigenous,\nEspouse my cause; then for the State ye gain\nA great deliverer, for my foemen bane.\nCHORUS.\nOur pity, Oedipus, thou needs must move,\nThou and these maidens; and the stronger plea\nThou urgest, as the savior of our land,\nDisposes me to counsel for thy weal.\nOEDIPUS.\nAid me, kind sirs; I will do all you bid.\nCHORUS.\nFirst make atonement to the deities,\nWhose grove by trespass thou didst first profane.\nOEDIPUS.\nAfter what manner, stranger?

Having come\nUnto a State that champions right and asks\nFor every action warranty of law,\nThou hast set aside the custom of the land,\nAnd like some freebooter art carrying off\nWhat plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth\nThou thoughtest this a city without men,\nOr manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.\nYet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;\nThebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,\nNor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou\nWert robbing me—aye and the gods to boot,\nHaling by force their suppliants, poor maids.\nWere I on Theban soil, to prosecute\nThe justest claim imaginable, I\nWould never wrest by violence my own\nWithout sanction of your State or King;\nI should behave as fits an outlander\nLiving amongst a foreign folk, but thou\nShamest a city that deserves it not,\nEven thine own, and plentitude of years\nHave made of thee an old man and a fool.\nTherefore again I charge thee as before,\nSee that the maidens are restored at once,\nUnless thou would’st continue here by force\nAnd not by choice a sojourner; so much\nI tell thee home and what I say, I mean.\nCHORUS.\nThy case is perilous; though by birth and race\nThou should’st be just, thou plainly doest wrong.\nCREON.\nNot deeming this city void of men\nOr counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say’st\nI did what I have done; rather I thought\nYour people were not like to set such store\nby kin of mine and keep them ’gainst my will.\nNor would they harbor, so I stood assured,\nA godless parricide, a reprobate\nConvicted of incestuous marriage ties.\nFor on her native hill of Ares here\n(I knew your far-famed Areopagus)\nSits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk\nTo stay within your borders. In that faith\nI hunted down my quarry; and e’en then\nI had refrained but for the curses dire\nWherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:\nSuch wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.\nAnger has no old age but only death;\nThe dead alone can feel no touch of spite.\nSo thou must work thy will; my cause is just\nBut weak without allies; yet will I try,\nOld as I am, to answer deeds with deeds.\nOEDIPUS.\nO shameless railer, think’st thou this abuse\nDefames my grey hairs rather than thine own?\nMurder and incest, deeds of horror, all\nThou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,\nNo willing sinner; so it pleased the gods\nWrath haply with my sinful race of old,\nSince thou could’st find no sin in me myself\nFor which in retribution I was doomed\nTo trespass thus against myself and mine.\nAnswer me now, if by some oracle\nMy sire was destined to a bloody end\nBy a son’s hand, can this reflect on me,\nMe then unborn, begotten by no sire,\nConceived in no mother’s womb? And if\nWhen born to misery, as born I was,\nI met my sire, not knowing whom I met\nor what I did, and slew him, how canst thou\nWith justice blame the all-unconscious hand?\nAnd for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,\nSeeing she was thy sister, to extort\nFrom me the story of her marriage, such\nA marriage as I straightway will proclaim.\nFor I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech\nHas broken all the bonds of reticence.\nShe was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;\nI knew it not, nor she; and she my mother\nBare children to the son whom she had borne,\nA birth of shame. But this at least I know\nWittingly thou aspersest her and me;\nBut I unwitting wed, unwilling speak.\nNay neither in this marriage or this deed\nWhich thou art ever casting in my teeth—\nA murdered sire—shall I be held to blame.\nCome, answer me one question, if thou canst:\nIf one should presently attempt thy life,\nWould’st thou, O man of justice, first inquire\nIf the assassin was perchance thy sire,\nOr turn upon him? As thou lov’st thy life,\nOn thy aggressor thou would’st turn, no stay\nDebating, if the law would bear thee out.\nSuch was my case, and such the pass whereto\nThe gods reduced me; and methinks my sire,\nCould he come back to life, would not dissent.\nYet thou, for just thou art not, but a man\nWho sticks at nothing, if it serve his plea,\nReproachest me with this before these men.\nIt serves thy turn to laud great Theseus’ name,\nAnd Athens as a wisely governed State;\nYet in thy flatteries one thing is to seek:\nIf any land knows how to pay the gods\nTheir proper rites, ’tis Athens most of all.\nThis is the land whence thou wast fain to steal\nTheir aged suppliant and hast carried off\nMy daughters. Therefore to yon goddesses,\nI turn, adjure them and invoke their aid\nTo champion my cause, that thou mayest learn\nWhat is the breed of men who guard this State.\nCHORUS.\nAn honest man, my liege, one sore bestead\nBy fortune, and so worthy our support.\nTHESEUS.\nEnough of words; the captors speed amain,\nWhile we the victims stand debating here.\nCREON.\nWhat would’st thou?

By a god-sent, painless doom, poor soul?\nMESSENGER.\nThy question hits the marvel of the tale.\nHow he moved hence, you saw him and must know;\nWithout a friend to lead the way, himself\nGuiding us all. So having reached the abrupt\nEarth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,\nHe paused at one of the converging paths,\nHard by the rocky basin which records\nThe pact of Theseus and Peirithous.\nBetwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,\nThe hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,\nMidway he sat and loosed his beggar’s weeds;\nThen calling to his daughters bade them fetch\nOf running water, both to wash withal\nAnd make libation; so they clomb the steep;\nAnd in brief space brought what their father bade,\nThen laved and dressed him with observance due.\nBut when he had his will in everything,\nAnd no desire was left unsatisfied,\nIt thundered from the netherworld; the maids\nShivered, and crouching at their father’s knees\nWept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.\nHe, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,\nFolded his arms about them both and said,\n“My children, ye will lose your sire today,\nFor all of me has perished, and no more\nHave ye to bear your long, long ministry;\nA heavy load, I know, and yet one word\nWipes out all score of tribulations—love.\nAnd love from me ye had—from no man more;\nBut now must live without me all your days.”\nSo clinging to each other sobbed and wept\nFather and daughters both, but when at last\nTheir mourning had an end and no wail rose,\nA moment there was silence; suddenly\nA voice that summoned him; with sudden dread\nThe hair of all stood up and all were ’mazed;\nFor the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.\n“Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?\nToo long, too long thy passing is delayed.”\nBut when he heard the summons of the god,\nHe prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when\nThe Prince came nearer: “O my friend,” he cried,\n“Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand—\nAnd, daughters, give him yours—and promise me\nThou never wilt forsake them, but do all\nThat time and friendship prompt in their behoof.”\nAnd he of his nobility repressed\nHis tears and swore to be their constant friend.\nThis promise given, Oedipus put forth\nBlind hands and laid them on his children, saying,\n“O children, prove your true nobility\nAnd hence depart nor seek to witness sights\nUnlawful or to hear unlawful words.\nNay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,\nOur ruler, to behold what next shall hap.”\nSo we all heard him speak, and weeping sore\nWe companied the maidens on their way.\nAfter brief space we looked again, and lo\nThe man was gone, evanished from our eyes;\nOnly the king we saw with upraised hand\nShading his eyes as from some awful sight,\nThat no man might endure to look upon.\nA moment later, and we saw him bend\nIn prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.\nBut by what doom the stranger met his end\nNo man save Theseus knoweth. For there fell\nNo fiery bold that reft him in that hour,\nNor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.\nIt was a messenger from heaven, or else\nSome gentle, painless cleaving of earth’s base;\nFor without wailing or disease or pain\nHe passed away—and end most marvelous.\nAnd if to some my tale seems foolishness\nI am content that such could count me fool.\nCHORUS.\nWhere are the maids and their attendant friends?\nMESSENGER.\nThey cannot be far off; the approaching sound\nOf lamentation tells they come this way.\n[Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE]\nANTIGONE.\n(Str. 1)\nWoe, woe! on this sad day\nWe sisters of one blasted stock\nmust bow beneath the shock,\nMust weep and weep the curse that lay\nOn him our sire, for whom\nIn life, a life-long world of care\n’Twas ours to bear,\nIn death must face the gloom\nThat wraps his tomb.\nWhat tongue can tell\nThat sight ineffable?\nCHORUS.\nWhat mean ye, maidens?\nANTIGONE.\nAll is but surmise.\nCHORUS.\nIs he then gone?\nANTIGONE.\nGone as ye most might wish.\nNot in battle or sea storm,\nBut reft from sight,\nBy hands invisible borne\nTo viewless fields of night.\nAh me! on us too night has come,\nThe night of mourning.

    "content":"OEDIPUS THE KING\nTranslation by F. Storr, BA\nFormerly Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge\nFrom the Loeb Library Edition\nOriginally published by\nHarvard University Press, Cambridge, MA\nand\nWilliam Heinemann Ltd, London\nFirst published in 1912\nARGUMENT\nTo Laius, King of Thebes, an oracle foretold that the child born to him by his queen Jocasta would slay his father and wed his mother. So when in time a son was born the infant’s feet were riveted together and he was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy, who grew up believing that he was indeed the King’s son. Afterwards doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he deemed his father’s house and in his flight he encountered and unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king. So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen. Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man. The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nOedipus.\nThe Priest of Zeus.\nCreon.\nChorus of Theban Elders.\nTeiresias.\nJocasta.\nMessenger.\nHerd of Laius.\nSecond Messenger.\nScene: Thebes. Before the Palace of Oedipus.\nOEDIPUS THE KING\nSuppliants of all ages are seated round the altar at the palace doors,\nat their head a PRIEST OF ZEUS. To them enter OEDIPUS.\nOEDIPUS.\nMy children, latest born to Cadmus old,\nWhy sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands\nBranches of olive filleted with wool?\nWhat means this reek of incense everywhere,\nAnd everywhere laments and litanies?\nChildren, it were not meet that I should learn\nFrom others, and am hither come, myself,\nI Oedipus, your world-renowned king.\nHo! aged sire, whose venerable locks\nProclaim thee spokesman of this company,\nExplain your mood and purport. Is it dread\nOf ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?\nMy zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;\nRuthless indeed were I and obdurate\nIf such petitioners as you I spurned.\nPRIEST.\nYea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,\nThou seest how both extremes of age besiege\nThy palace altars—fledglings hardly winged,\nand greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I\nof Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.\nMeanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs\nCrowd our two market-places, or before\nBoth shrines of Pallas congregate, or where\nIsmenus gives his oracles by fire.\nFor, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,\nSore buffeted, can no more lift her head,\nFoundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.\nA blight is on our harvest in the ear,\nA blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,\nA blight on wives in travail; and withal\nArmed with his blazing torch the God of Plague\nHath swooped upon our city emptying\nThe house of Cadmus, and the murky realm\nOf Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.\nTherefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,\nI and these children; not as deeming thee\nA new divinity, but the first of men;\nFirst in the common accidents of life,\nAnd first in visitations of the Gods.\nArt thou not he who coming to the town\nof Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid\nTo the fell songstress? Nor hadst thou received\nPrompting from us or been by others schooled;\nNo, by a god inspired (so all men deem,\nAnd testify) didst thou renew our life.\nAnd now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,\nAll we thy votaries beseech thee, find\nSome succor, whether by a voice from heaven\nWhispered, or haply known by human wit.\nTried counselors, methinks, are aptest found1\nTo furnish for the future pregnant rede.\nUpraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!\nLook to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore\nOur country’s savior thou art justly hailed:\nO never may we thus record thy reign:—\n“He raised us up only to cast us down.”\nUplift us, build our city on a rock.\nThy happy star ascendant brought us luck,\nO let it not decline! If thou wouldst rule\nThis land, as now thou reignest, better sure\nTo rule a peopled than a desert realm.\nNor battlements nor galleys aught avail,\nIf men to man and guards to guard them tail.\nOEDIPUS.\nAh! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,\nThe quest that brings you hither and your need.\nYe sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,\nHow great soever yours, outtops it all.\nYour sorrow touches each man severally,\nHim and none other, but I grieve at once\nBoth for the general and myself and you.\nTherefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.\nMany, my children, are the tears I’ve wept,\nAnd threaded many a maze of weary thought.\nThus pondering one clue of hope I caught,\nAnd tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus’ son,\nCreon, my consort’s brother, to inquire\nOf Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,\nHow I might save the State by act or word.\nAnd now I reckon up the tale of days\nSince he set forth, and marvel how he fares.\n’Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.\nBut when he comes, then I were base indeed,\nIf I perform not all the god declares.\nPRIEST.\nThy words are well timed; even as thou speakest\nThat shouting tells me Creon is at hand.\nOEDIPUS.\nO King Apollo! may his joyous looks\nBe presage of the joyous news he brings!\nPRIEST.\nAs I surmise, ’tis welcome; else his head\nHad scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.\nOEDIPUS.\nWe soon shall know; he’s now in earshot range.\n[Enter CREON]\nMy royal cousin, say, Menoeceus’ child,\nWhat message hast thou brought us from the god?\nCREON.\nGood news, for e’en intolerable ills,\nFinding right issue, tend to naught but good.\nOEDIPUS.\nHow runs the oracle? thus far thy words\nGive me no ground for confidence or fear.\nCREON.\nIf thou wouldst hear my message publicly,\nI’ll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.\nOEDIPUS.\nSpeak before all; the burden that I bear\nIs more for these my subjects than myself.\nCREON.\nLet me report then all the god declared.\nKing Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate\nA fell pollution that infests the land,\nAnd no more harbor an inveterate sore.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat expiation means he? What’s amiss?\nCREON.\nBanishment, or the shedding blood for blood.\nThis stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?\nCREON.\nBefore thou didst assume the helm of State,\nThe sovereign of this land was Laius.\nOEDIPUS.\nI heard as much, but never saw the man.\nCREON.\nHe fell; and now the god’s command is plain:\nPunish his takers-off, whoe’er they be.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere are they? Where in the wide world to find\nThe far, faint traces of a bygone crime?\nCREON.\nIn this land, said the god; “who seeks shall find;\nWho sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind.”\nOEDIPUS.\nWas he within his palace, or afield,\nOr traveling, when Laius met his fate?\nCREON.\nAbroad; he started, so he told us, bound\nFor Delphi, but he never thence returned.\nOEDIPUS.\nCame there no news, no fellow-traveler\nTo give some clue that might be followed up?\nCREON.\nBut one escape, who flying for dear life,\nCould tell of all he saw but one thing sure.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd what was that? One clue might lead us far,\nWith but a spark of hope to guide our quest.\nCREON.\nRobbers, he told us, not one bandit but\nA troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.\nOEDIPUS.\nDid any bandit dare so bold a stroke,\nUnless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?\nCREON.\nSo ’twas surmised, but none was found to avenge\nHis murder mid the trouble that ensued.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat trouble can have hindered a full quest,\nWhen royalty had fallen thus miserably?\nCREON.\nThe riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide\nThe dim past and attend to instant needs.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell, I will start afresh and once again\nMake dark things clear. Right worthy the concern\nOf Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;\nI also, as is meet, will lend my aid\nTo avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.\nNot for some far-off kinsman, but myself,\nShall I expel this poison in the blood;\nFor whoso slew that king might have a mind\nTo strike me too with his assassin hand.\nTherefore in righting him I serve myself.\nUp, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,\nTake hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither\nThe Theban commons. With the god’s good help\nSuccess is sure; ’tis ruin if we fail.\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and CREON]\nPRIEST.\nCome, children, let us hence; these gracious words\nForestall the very purpose of our suit.\nAnd may the god who sent this oracle\nSave us withal and rid us of this pest.\n[Exeunt PRIEST and SUPPLIANTS]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nSweet-voiced daughter of Zeus from thy gold-paved Pythian shrine\nWafted to Thebes divine,\nWhat dost thou bring me? My soul is racked and shivers with fear.\n(Healer of Delos, hear!)\nHast thou some pain unknown before,\nOr with the circling years renewest a penance of yore?\nOffspring of golden Hope, thou voice immortal, O tell me.\n(Ant. 1)\nFirst on Athene I call; O Zeus-born goddess, defend!\nGoddess and sister, befriend,\nArtemis, Lady of Thebes, high-throned in the midst of our mart!\nLord of the death-winged dart!\nYour threefold aid I crave\nFrom death and ruin our city to save.\nIf in the days of old when we nigh had perished, ye drave\nFrom our land the fiery plague, be near us now and defend us!\n(Str. 2)\nAh me, what countless woes are mine!\nAll our host is in decline;\nWeaponless my spirit lies.\nEarth her gracious fruits denies;\nWomen wail in barren throes;\nLife on life downstriken goes,\nSwifter than the wind bird’s flight,\nSwifter than the Fire-God’s might,\nTo the westering shores of Night.\n(Ant. 2)\nWasted thus by death on death\nAll our city perisheth.\nCorpses spread infection round;\nNone to tend or mourn is found.\nWailing on the altar stair\nWives and grandams rend the air—\nLong-drawn moans and piercing cries\nBlent with prayers and litanies.\nGolden child of Zeus, O hear\nLet thine angel face appear!\n(Str. 3)\nAnd grant that Ares whose hot breath I feel,\nThough without targe or steel\nHe stalks, whose voice is as the battle shout,\nMay turn in sudden rout,\nTo the unharbored Thracian waters sped,\nOr Amphitrite’s bed.\nFor what night leaves undone,\nSmit by the morrow’s sun\nPerisheth. Father Zeus, whose hand\nDoth wield the lightning brand,\nSlay him beneath thy levin bold, we pray,\nSlay him, O slay!\n(Ant. 3)\nO that thine arrows too, Lycean King,\nFrom that taut bow’s gold string,\nMight fly abroad, the champions of our rights;\nYea, and the flashing lights\nOf Artemis, wherewith the huntress sweeps\nAcross the Lycian steeps.\nThee too I call with golden-snooded hair,\nWhose name our land doth bear,\nBacchus to whom thy Maenads Evoe shout;\nCome with thy bright torch, rout,\nBlithe god whom we adore,\nThe god whom gods abhor.\n[Enter OEDIPUS.]\nOEDIPUS.\nYe pray; ’tis well, but would ye hear my words\nAnd heed them and apply the remedy,\nYe might perchance find comfort and relief.\nMind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger\nTo this report, no less than to the crime;\nFor how unaided could I track it far\nWithout a clue? Which lacking (for too late\nWas I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)\nThis proclamation I address to all:—\nThebans, if any knows the man by whom\nLaius, son of Labdacus, was slain,\nI summon him to make clean shrift to me.\nAnd if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus\nConfessing he shall ’scape the capital charge;\nFor the worst penalty that shall befall him\nIs banishment—unscathed he shall depart.\nBut if an alien from a foreign land\nBe known to any as the murderer,\nLet him who knows speak out, and he shall have\nDue recompense from me and thanks to boot.\nBut if ye still keep silence, if through fear\nFor self or friends ye disregard my hest,\nHear what I then resolve; I lay my ban\nOn the assassin whosoe’er he be.\nLet no man in this land, whereof I hold\nThe sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;\nGive him no part in prayer or sacrifice\nOr lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.\nFor this is our defilement, so the god\nHath lately shown to me by oracles.\nThus as their champion I maintain the cause\nBoth of the god and of the murdered King.\nAnd on the murderer this curse I lay\n(On him and all the partners in his guilt):—\nWretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!\nAnd for myself, if with my privity\nHe gain admittance to my hearth, I pray\nThe curse I laid on others fall on me.\nSee that ye give effect to all my hest,\nFor my sake and the god’s and for our land,\nA desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.\nFor, let alone the god’s express command,\nIt were a scandal ye should leave unpurged\nThe murder of a great man and your king,\nNor track it home. And now that I am lord,\nSuccessor to his throne, his bed, his wife,\n(And had he not been frustrate in the hope\nOf issue, common children of one womb\nHad forced a closer bond twixt him and me,\nBut Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I\nHis blood-avenger will maintain his cause\nAs though he were my sire, and leave no stone\nUnturned to track the assassin or avenge\nThe son of Labdacus, of Polydore,\nOf Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.\nAnd for the disobedient thus I pray:\nMay the gods send them neither timely fruits\nOf earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,\nBut may they waste and pine, as now they waste,\nAye and worse stricken; but to all of you,\nMy loyal subjects who approve my acts,\nMay Justice, our ally, and all the gods\nBe gracious and attend you evermore.\nCHORUS.\nThe oath thou profferest, sire, I take and swear.\nI slew him not myself, nor can I name\nThe slayer. For the quest, ’twere well, methinks\nThat Phoebus, who proposed the riddle, himself\nShould give the answer—who the murderer was.\nOEDIPUS.\nWell argued; but no living man can hope\nTo force the gods to speak against their will.\nCHORUS.\nMay I then say what seems next best to me?\nOEDIPUS.\nAye, if there be a third best, tell it too.\nCHORUS.\nMy liege, if any man sees eye to eye\nWith our lord Phoebus, ’tis our prophet, lord\nTeiresias; he of all men best might guide\nA searcher of this matter to the light.\nOEDIPUS.\nHere too my zeal has nothing lagged, for twice\nAt Creon’s instance have I sent to fetch him,\nAnd long I marvel why he is not here.\nCHORUS.\nI mind me too of rumors long ago—\nMere gossip.\nOEDIPUS.\nTell them, I would fain know all.\nCHORUS.\n’Twas said he fell by travelers.\nOEDIPUS.\nSo I heard,\nBut none has seen the man who saw him fall.\nCHORUS.\nWell, if he knows what fear is, he will quail\nAnd flee before the terror of thy curse.\nOEDIPUS.\nWords scare not him who blenches not at deeds.\nCHORUS.\nBut here is one to arraign him. Lo, at length\nThey bring the god-inspired seer in whom\nAbove all other men is truth inborn.\n[Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy.]\nOEDIPUS.\nTeiresias, seer who comprehendest all,\nLore of the wise and hidden mysteries,\nHigh things of heaven and low things of the earth,\nThou knowest, though thy blinded eyes see naught,\nWhat plague infects our city; and we turn\nTo thee, O seer, our one defense and shield.\nThe purport of the answer that the God\nReturned to us who sought his oracle,\nThe messengers have doubtless told thee—how\nOne course alone could rid us of the pest,\nTo find the murderers of Laius,\nAnd slay them or expel them from the land.\nTherefore begrudging neither augury\nNor other divination that is thine,\nO save thyself, thy country, and thy king,\nSave all from this defilement of blood shed.\nOn thee we rest. This is man’s highest end,\nTo others’ service all his powers to lend.\nTEIRESIAS.\nAlas, alas, what misery to be wise\nWhen wisdom profits nothing! This old lore\nI had forgotten; else I were not here.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat ails thee? Why this melancholy mood?\nTEIRESIAS.\nLet me go home; prevent me not; ’twere best\nThat thou shouldst bear thy burden and I mine.\nOEDIPUS.\nFor shame! no true-born Theban patriot\nWould thus withhold the word of prophecy.\nTEIRESIAS.\nThy words, O king, are wide of the mark, and I\nFor fear lest I too trip like thee...\nOEDIPUS.\nOh speak,\nWithhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know’st,\nThy knowledge. We are all thy suppliants.\nTEIRESIAS.\nAye, for ye all are witless, but my voice\nWill ne’er reveal my miseries—or thine.2\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat then, thou knowest, and yet willst not speak!\nWouldst thou betray us and destroy the State?\nTEIRESIAS.\nI will not vex myself nor thee. Why ask\nThus idly what from me thou shalt not learn?\nOEDIPUS.\nMonster! thy silence would incense a flint.\nWill nothing loose thy tongue? Can nothing melt thee,\nOr shake thy dogged taciturnity?\nTEIRESIAS.\nThou blam’st my mood and seest not thine own\nWherewith thou art mated; no, thou taxest me.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd who could stay his choler when he heard\nHow insolently thou dost flout the State?\nTEIRESIAS.\nWell, it will come what will, though I be mute.\nOEDIPUS.\nSince come it must, thy duty is to tell me.\nTEIRESIAS.\nI have no more to say; storm as thou willst,\nAnd give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.\nOEDIPUS.\nYea, I am wroth, and will not stint my words,\nBut speak my whole mind. Thou methinks thou art he,\nWho planned the crime, aye, and performed it too,\nAll save the assassination; and if thou\nHadst not been blind, I had been sworn to boot\nThat thou alone didst do the bloody deed.\nTEIRESIAS.\nIs it so? Then I charge thee to abide\nBy thine own proclamation; from this day\nSpeak not to these or me.

When the riddling Sphinx was here\nWhy hadst thou no deliverance for this folk?\nAnd yet the riddle was not to be solved\nBy guess-work but required the prophet’s art;\nWherein thou wast found lacking; neither birds\nNor sign from heaven helped thee, but I came,\nThe simple Oedipus; I stopped her mouth\nBy mother wit, untaught of auguries.\nThis is the man whom thou wouldst undermine,\nIn hope to reign with Creon in my stead.\nMethinks that thou and thine abettor soon\nWill rue your plot to drive the scapegoat out.\nThank thy grey hairs that thou hast still to learn\nWhat chastisement such arrogance deserves.\nCHORUS.\nTo us it seems that both the seer and thou,\nO Oedipus, have spoken angry words.\nThis is no time to wrangle but consult\nHow best we may fulfill the oracle.\nTEIRESIAS.\nKing as thou art, free speech at least is mine\nTo make reply; in this I am thy peer.\nI own no lord but Loxias; him I serve\nAnd ne’er can stand enrolled as Creon’s man.\nThus then I answer: since thou hast not spared\nTo twit me with my blindness—thou hast eyes,\nYet see’st not in what misery thou art fallen,\nNor where thou dwellest nor with whom for mate.\nDost know thy lineage? Nay, thou know’st it not,\nAnd all unwitting art a double foe\nTo thine own kin, the living and the dead;\nAye and the dogging curse of mother and sire\nOne day shall drive thee, like a two-edged sword,\nBeyond our borders, and the eyes that now\nSee clear shall henceforward endless night.\nAh whither shall thy bitter cry not reach,\nWhat crag in all Cithaeron but shall then\nReverberate thy wail, when thou hast found\nWith what a hymeneal thou wast borne\nHome, but to no fair haven, on the gale!\nAye, and a flood of ills thou guessest not\nShall set thyself and children in one line.\nFlout then both Creon and my words, for none\nOf mortals shall be striken worse than thou.\nOEDIPUS.\nMust I endure this fellow’s insolence?\nA murrain on thee!

First, I bid thee think,\nWould any mortal choose a troubled reign\nOf terrors rather than secure repose,\nIf the same power were given him? As for me,\nI have no natural craving for the name\nOf king, preferring to do kingly deeds,\nAnd so thinks every sober-minded man.\nNow all my needs are satisfied through thee,\nAnd I have naught to fear; but were I king,\nMy acts would oft run counter to my will.\nHow could a title then have charms for me\nAbove the sweets of boundless influence?\nI am not so infatuate as to grasp\nThe shadow when I hold the substance fast.\nNow all men cry me Godspeed! wish me well,\nAnd every suitor seeks to gain my ear,\nIf he would hope to win a grace from thee.\nWhy should I leave the better, choose the worse?\nThat were sheer madness, and I am not mad.\nNo such ambition ever tempted me,\nNor would I have a share in such intrigue.\nAnd if thou doubt me, first to Delphi go,\nThere ascertain if my report was true\nOf the god’s answer; next investigate\nIf with the seer I plotted or conspired,\nAnd if it prove so, sentence me to death,\nNot by thy voice alone, but mine and thine.\nBut O condemn me not, without appeal,\nOn bare suspicion. ’Tis not right to adjudge\nBad men at random good, or good men bad.\nI would as lief a man should cast away\nThe thing he counts most precious, his own life,\nAs spurn a true friend.

To banish me the land?\nOEDIPUS.\nI would not have thee banished, no, but dead,\nThat men may mark the wages envy reaps.\nCREON.\nI see thou wilt not yield, nor credit me.\nOEDIPUS.\n[None but a fool would credit such as thou.]3\nCREON.\nThou art not wise.\nOEDIPUS.\nWise for myself at least.\nCREON.\nWhy not for me too?\nOEDIPUS.\nWhy for such a knave?\nCREON.\nSuppose thou lackest sense.\nOEDIPUS.\nYet kings must rule.\nCREON.\nNot if they rule ill.\nOEDIPUS.\nOh my Thebans, hear him!\nCREON.\nThy Thebans? am not I a Theban too?\nCHORUS.\nCease, princes; lo there comes, and none too soon,\nJocasta from the palace.

An oracle\nOnce came to Laius (I will not say\n’Twas from the Delphic god himself, but from\nHis ministers) declaring he was doomed\nTo perish by the hand of his own son,\nA child that should be born to him by me.\nNow Laius—so at least report affirmed—\nWas murdered on a day by highwaymen,\nNo natives, at a spot where three roads meet.\nAs for the child, it was but three days old,\nWhen Laius, its ankles pierced and pinned\nTogether, gave it to be cast away\nBy others on the trackless mountain side.\nSo then Apollo brought it not to pass\nThe child should be his father’s murderer,\nOr the dread terror find accomplishment,\nAnd Laius be slain by his own son.\nSuch was the prophet’s horoscope. O king,\nRegard it not. Whate’er the god deems fit\nTo search, himself unaided will reveal.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhat memories, what wild tumult of the soul\nCame o’er me, lady, as I heard thee speak!\nJOCASTA.\nWhat mean’st thou? What has shocked and startled thee?\nOEDIPUS.\nMethought I heard thee say that Laius\nWas murdered at the meeting of three roads.\nJOCASTA.\nSo ran the story that is current still.\nOEDIPUS.\nWhere did this happen? Dost thou know the place?\nJOCASTA.\nPhocis the land is called; the spot is where\nBranch roads from Delphi and from Daulis meet.\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd how long is it since these things befell?\nJOCASTA.\n’Twas but a brief while were thou wast proclaimed\nOur country’s ruler that the news was brought.\nOEDIPUS.\nO Zeus, what hast thou willed to do with me!\nJOCASTA.\nWhat is it, Oedipus, that moves thee so?\nOEDIPUS.\nAsk me not yet; tell me the build and height\nOf Laius? Was he still in manhood’s prime?\nJOCASTA.\nTall was he, and his hair was lightly strewn\nWith silver; and not unlike thee in form.\nOEDIPUS.\nO woe is me! Mehtinks unwittingly\nI laid but now a dread curse on myself.\nJOCASTA.\nWhat say’st thou? When I look upon thee, my king,\nI tremble.\nOEDIPUS.\n’Tis a dread presentiment\nThat in the end the seer will prove not blind.\nOne further question to resolve my doubt.\nJOCASTA.\nI quail; but ask, and I will answer all.\nOEDIPUS.\nHad he but few attendants or a train\nOf armed retainers with him, like a prince?\nJOCASTA.\nThey were but five in all, and one of them\nA herald; Laius in a mule-car rode.\nOEDIPUS.\nAlas! ’tis clear as noonday now. But say,\nLady, who carried this report to Thebes?\nJOCASTA.\nA serf, the sole survivor who returned.\nOEDIPUS.\nHaply he is at hand or in the house?\nJOCASTA.\nNo, for as soon as he returned and found\nThee reigning in the stead of Laius slain,\nHe clasped my hand and supplicated me\nTo send him to the alps and pastures, where\nHe might be farthest from the sight of Thebes.\nAnd so I sent him. ’Twas an honest slave\nAnd well deserved some better recompense.\nOEDIPUS.\nFetch him at once. I fain would see the man.\nJOCASTA.\nHe shall be brought; but wherefore summon him?\nOEDIPUS.\nLady, I fear my tongue has overrun\nDiscretion; therefore I would question him.\nJOCASTA.\nWell, he shall come, but may not I too claim\nTo share the burden of thy heart, my king?\nOEDIPUS.\nAnd thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish.\nNow my imaginings have gone so far.\nWho has a higher claim that thou to hear\nMy tale of dire adventures? Listen then.\nMy sire was Polybus of Corinth, and\nMy mother Merope, a Dorian;\nAnd I was held the foremost citizen,\nTill a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,\nYet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.\nA roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,\nShouted “Thou art not true son of thy sire.”\nIt irked me, but I stomached for the nonce\nThe insult; on the morrow I sought out\nMy mother and my sire and questioned them.\nThey were indignant at the random slur\nCast on my parentage and did their best\nTo comfort me, but still the venomed barb\nRankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.\nSo privily without their leave I went\nTo Delphi, and Apollo sent me back\nBaulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.\nBut other grievous things he prophesied,\nWoes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;\nTo wit I should defile my mother’s bed\nAnd raise up seed too loathsome to behold,\nAnd slay the father from whose loins I sprang.\nThen, lady,—thou shalt hear the very truth—\nAs I drew near the triple-branching roads,\nA herald met me and a man who sat\nIn a car drawn by colts—as in thy tale—\nThe man in front and the old man himself\nThreatened to thrust me rudely from the path,\nThen jostled by the charioteer in wrath\nI struck him, and the old man, seeing this,\nWatched till I passed and from his car brought down\nFull on my head the double-pointed goad.\nYet was I quits with him and more; one stroke\nOf my good staff sufficed to fling him clean\nOut of the chariot seat and laid him prone.\nAnd so I slew them every one. But if\nBetwixt this stranger there was aught in common\nWith Laius, who more miserable than I,\nWhat mortal could you find more god-abhorred?\nWretch whom no sojourner, no citizen\nMay harbor or address, whom all are bound\nTo harry from their homes. And this same curse\nWas laid on me, and laid by none but me.\nYea with these hands all gory I pollute\nThe bed of him I slew. Say, am I vile?\nAm I not utterly unclean, a wretch\nDoomed to be banished, and in banishment\nForgo the sight of all my dearest ones,\nAnd never tread again my native earth;\nOr else to wed my mother and slay my sire,\nPolybus, who begat me and upreared?\nIf one should say, this is the handiwork\nOf some inhuman power, who could blame\nHis judgment? But, ye pure and awful gods,\nForbid, forbid that I should see that day!\nMay I be blotted out from living men\nEre such a plague spot set on me its brand!\nCHORUS.\nWe too, O king, are troubled; but till thou\nHast questioned the survivor, still hope on.\nOEDIPUS.\nMy hope is faint, but still enough survives\nTo bid me bide the coming of this herd.\nJOCASTA.\nSuppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?\nOEDIPUS.\nI’ll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees\nWith thine, I shall have ’scaped calamity.\nJOCASTA.\nAnd what of special import did I say?\nOEDIPUS.\nIn thy report of what the herdsman said\nLaius was slain by robbers; now if he\nStill speaks of robbers, not a robber, I\nSlew him not; “one” with “many” cannot square.\nBut if he says one lonely wayfarer,\nThe last link wanting to my guilt is forged.\nJOCASTA.\nWell, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,\nNor can he now retract what then he said;\nNot I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.\nE’en should he vary somewhat in his story,\nHe cannot make the death of Laius\nIn any wise jump with the oracle.\nFor Loxias said expressly he was doomed\nTo die by my child’s hand, but he, poor babe,\nHe shed no blood, but perished first himself.\nSo much for divination. Henceforth I\nWill look for signs neither to right nor left.\nOEDIPUS.\nThou reasonest well. Still I would have thee send\nAnd fetch the bondsman hither. See to it.\nJOCASTA.\nThat will I straightway. Come, let us within.\nI would do nothing that my lord mislikes.\n[Exeunt OEDIPUS and JOCASTA]\nCHORUS.\n(Str. 1)\nMy lot be still to lead\nThe life of innocence and fly\nIrreverence in word or deed,\nTo follow still those laws ordained on high\nWhose birthplace is the bright ethereal sky\nNo mortal birth they own,\nOlympus their progenitor alone:\nNe’er shall they slumber in oblivion cold,\nThe god in them is strong and grows not old.\n(Ant. 1)\nOf insolence is bred\nThe tyrant; insolence full blown,\nWith empty riches surfeited,\nScales the precipitous height and grasps the throne.\nThen topples o’er and lies in ruin prone;\nNo foothold on that dizzy steep.\nBut O may Heaven the true patriot keep\nWho burns with emulous zeal to serve the State.\nGod is my help and hope, on him I wait.\n(Str. 2)\nBut the proud sinner, or in word or deed,\nThat will not Justice heed,\nNor reverence the shrine\nOf images divine,\nPerdition seize his vain imaginings,\nIf, urged by greed profane,\nHe grasps at ill-got gain,\nAnd lays an impious hand on holiest things.\nWho when such deeds are done\nCan hope heaven’s bolts to shun?\nIf sin like this to honor can aspire,\nWhy dance I still and lead the sacred choir?\n(Ant. 2)\nNo more I’ll seek earth’s central oracle,\nOr Abae’s hallowed cell,\nNor to Olympia bring\nMy votive offering.\nIf before all God’s truth be not bade plain.\nO Zeus, reveal thy might,\nKing, if thou’rt named aright\nOmnipotent, all-seeing, as of old;\nFor Laius is forgot;\nHis weird, men heed it not;\nApollo is forsook and faith grows cold.\n[Enter JOCASTA.]\nJOCASTA.\nMy lords, ye look amazed to see your queen\nWith wreaths and gifts of incense in her hands.\nI had a mind to visit the high shrines,\nFor Oedipus is overwrought, alarmed\nWith terrors manifold.

    "content":"PHILOCTETES\nTHE PERSONS\nODYSSEUS.\nNEOPTOLEMUS.\nCHORUS of Mariners.\nPHILOCTETES.\nMessenger, disguised as a Merchantman.\nHERACLES, appearing from the sky.\nSCENE. A desert shore of the Island of Lemnos.\n[page 216]It was fated that Troy should be taken by Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, assisted by the bow of Heracles in the hands of Philoctetes.\nNow Philoctetes had been rejected by the army because of a trouble in his foot, which made his presence with them insufferable; and had been cast away by Odysseus on the island of Lemnos.\nBut when the decree of fate was revealed by prophecy, Odysseus undertook to bring Philoctetes back, and took with him Neoptolemus, whose ambition could only be gratified through the return of Philoctetes with the bow.\nPhiloctetes was resolutely set against returning, and at the opening of the drama Neoptolemus is persuaded by Odysseus to take him with guile.\nBut when Philoctetes appears, the youth’s ingenuous nature is so wrought upon through pity and remorse, that his sympathy and native truthfulness at length overcome his ambition.\nWhen the inward sacrifice is complete, Heracles appears from heaven, and by a few words changes the mind of Philoctetes, so that all ends well.\n[page 217]\nPHILOCTETES\nODYSSEUS. NEOPTOLEMUS.\nODYSSEUS. This coast of sea-girt Lemnos, where we stand,\nIs uninhabited, untrodden of men.\nAnd here, O noble son of noblest sire,\nAchilles-born Neoptolemus, I erewhile,—\nOrdered by those who had command,—cast forth\nTrachinian Philoctetes, Poeas’ son,\nHis foot dark-dripping with a rankling wound;\nWhen with wild cries, that frighted holy rest,\nFilling the camp, he troubled every rite,\nThat none might handle sacrifice, or pour\nWine-offering, but his noise disturbed our peace.\nBut why these words? No moment this for talk,\nLest he discern my coming, and I lose\nThe scheme, wherewith I think to catch him soon.\nNow most behoves thy service, to explore\nThis headland for a cave with double mouth,\nWhose twofold aperture, on wintry days,\nGives choice of sunshine, and in summer noons\nThe breeze wafts slumber through the airy cell.\nThen, something lower down, upon the left,\nUnless ’tis dried, thine eye may note a spring.\nGo near now silently, and make me know\nIf still he persevere, and hold this spot,\nOr have roamed elsewhere, that informed of this\nI may proceed with what remains to say,\nAnd we may act in concert.\nNEOPTOLEMUS. Lord Odysseus,\nThy foremost errand will not task me far.\nMethinks I see the cave whereof thou speakest.\nOD. Where? let me see it. Above there, or below?\n[page 218][29-64]\nNEO. Yonder, above. And yet I hear no tread.\n[NEOPTOLEMUS climbs up to the cave\nOD. Look if he be not lodged in slumber there.\nNEO. I find no inmate, but an empty room.\nOD. What? no provision for a dwelling-place?\nNEO. A bed of leaves for some one harbouring here.\nOD. Nought else beneath the roof? Is all forlorn?\nNEO. A cup of wood, some untaught craftsman’s skill,\nAnd, close at hand, these embers of a fire.\nOD. That store is his. I read the token clear.\nNEO. Oh! and these festering rags give evidence,\nSteeped as with dressing some malignant sore.\nOD. The man inhabits here: I know it now.\nAnd sure he’s not far off. How can he range,\nWhose limb drags heavy with an ancient harm?\nBut he’s gone, either to bring forage home,\nOr where he hath found some plant of healing power.\nSend therefore thine attendant to look forth,\nLest unawares he find me. All our host\nWere not so fair a prize for him as I.\nNEO. My man is going, and shall watch the path.\nWhat more dost thou require of me? Speak on.\nOD. Son of Achilles, know that thou art come\nTo serve us nobly, not with strength alone,\nBut, faithful to thy mission, if so be,\nTo do things strange, unwonted to thine ear.\nNEO. What dost thou bid me?\nOD. ’Tis thy duty now\nTo entrap the mind of Poeas’ son with words.\nWhen he shall ask thee, who and whence thou art,\nDeclare thy name and father. ’Tis not that\nI charge thee to conceal. But for thy voyage,\n’Tis homeward, leaving the Achaean host,\nWith perfect hatred hating them, because\nThey who had drawn thee with strong prayers from home,\nTheir hope for taking Troy, allowed thee not\nThy just demand to have thy father’s arms,\nBut, e’er thy coming, wrongly gave them o’er\n[page 219][64-101]Unto Odysseus: and thereon launch forth\nWith boundless execration against me.\nThat will not pain me, but if thou reject\nThis counsel, thou wilt trouble all our host,\nSince, if his bow shall not be ta’en, thy life\nWill ne’er be crowned through Troy’s discomfiture.\nNow let me show, why thine approach to him\nIs safe and trustful as mine cannot be\nThou didst sail forth, not to redeem thine oath,\nNor by constraint, nor with the foremost band.\nAll which reproaches I must bear: and he,\nBut seeing me, while master of his bow,\nWill slay me, and my ruin will be thine.\nThis point then craves our cunning, to acquire\nBy subtle means the irresistible bow—\nThy nature was not framed, I know it well,\nFor speaking falsehood, or contriving harm.\nYet, since the prize of victory is so dear,\nEndure it—We’ll be just another day\nBut now, for one brief hour, devote thyself\nTo serve me without shame, and then for aye\nHereafter be the pearl of righteousness.\nNEO. The thing that, being named, revolts mine ear,\nSon of Laërtes, I abhor to do\n’Tis not my nature, no, nor, as they tell,\nMy father’s, to work aught by craft and guile.\nI’ll undertake to bring him in by force,\nNot by deceit. For, sure, with his one foot,\nHe cannot be a match for all our crew\nBeing sent, my lord, to serve thee, I am loth\nTo seem rebellious. But I rather choose\nTo offend with honour, than to win by wrong.\nOD. Son of a valiant sire, I, too, in youth,\nHad once a slow tongue and an active hand.\nBut since I have proved the world, I clearly see\nWords and not deeds give mastery over men.\nNEO. What then is thy command? To lie? No more?\nOD. To entangle Philoctetes with deceit.\n[page 210][102-134]NEO. Why through deceit? May not persuasion fetch him?\nOD. Never. And force as certainly will fail.\nNEO. What lends him such assurance of defence?\nOD. Arrows, the unerring harbingers of Death.\nNEO. Then to go near him is a perilous thing.\nOD. Unless with subtlety, as I have said.\nNEO. And is not lying shameful to thy soul?\nOD. Not if by lying I can save my soul.\nNEO. How must one look in speaking such a word?\nOD. Where gain invites, this shrinking is not good.\nNEO. What gain I through his coming back to Troy?\nOD. His arms alone have power to take Troy-town.\nNEO. Then am not I the spoiler, as ye said?\nOD. Thou without them, they without thee, are powerless.\nNEO. If it be so, they must be sought and won.\nOD. Yea, for in this two prizes will be thine.\nNEO. What? When I learn them, I will not refuse.\nOD. Wisdom and valour joined in one good name.\nNEO. Shame, to the winds! Come, I will do this thing.\nOD. Say, dost thou bear my bidding full in mind?\nNEO. Doubt not, since once for all I have embraced it.\nOD. Thou, then, await him here. I will retire,\nFor fear my hated presence should be known,\nAnd take back our attendant to the ship.\nAnd then once more, should ye appear to waste\nThe time unduly, I will send again\nThis same man hither in disguise, transformed\nTo the strange semblance of a merchantman;\nFrom dark suggestion of whose crafty tongue,\nThou, O my son, shalt gather timely counsel.\nNow to my ship. This charge I leave to thee.\nMay secret Hermes guide us to our end,\nAnd civic Pallas, named of victory,\nThe sure protectress of my devious way.\n[page 221][135-162]\nCHORUS (entering).\nStrange in the stranger land,I 1\nWhat shall I speak? What hide\nFrom a heart suspicious of ill?\nTell me, O master mine!\nWise above all is the man,\nPeerless in searching thought,\nWho with the Zeus-given wand\nWieldeth a Heaven-sent power.\nThis unto thee, dear son,\nFraught with ancestral might,\nThis to thy life hath come.\nWherefore I bid thee declare,\nWhat must I do for thy need?\nNEO. Even now methinks thou longest to espy\nNear ocean’s marge the place where he doth lie.\nGaze without fear. But when the traveller stern,\nWho from this roof is parted, shall return,\nAdvancing still as I the signal give,\nTo serve each moment’s mission thou shalt strive.\nCH. That, O my son, from of oldI 2\nHath been my care, to take note\nWhat by thy beck’ning is told;\nStill thy success to promote.\nBut for our errand to-day\nBehoves thee, master, to say\nWhere is the hearth of his home;\nOr where even now doth he roam?\nO tell me, lest all unaware\nHe spring like a wolf from his lair\nAnd I by surprise should be ta’en,\nWhere doth he move or remain,\nHere lodging, or wandering away?\nNEO. Thou seëst yon double doorway of his cell,\nPoor habitation of the rock.\nCH. 2. But tell\nWhere is the pain-worn wight himself abroad?\nNEO. To me ’tis clear, that, in his quest for food,\n[page 222][163-204]Here, not far off, he trails yon furrowed path.\nFor, so ’tis told, this mode the sufferer hath\nOf sustenance, oh hardness! bringing low\nWild creatures with wing’d arrows from his bow;\nNor findeth healer for his troublous woe.\nCH. I feel his misery.II 1\nWith no companion eye,\nFar from all human care,\nHe pines with fell disease;\nEach want he hourly sees\nAwakening new despair.\nHow can he bear it still?\nO cruel Heavens! O pain\nOf that afflicted mortal train\nWhose life sharp sorrows fill!\nBorn in a princely hall,II 2\nHighest, perchance, of all,\nNow lies he comfortless\nAlone in deep distress,\n’Mongst rough and dappled brutes,\nWith pangs and hunger worn;\nWhile from far distance shoots,\nOn airy pinion borne,\nThe unbridled Echo, still replying\nTo his most bitter crying.\nNEO. At nought of this I marvel—for if I\nJudge rightly, there assailed him from on high\nThat former plague through Chrysa’s cruel sting:\nAnd if to-day he suffer anything\nWith none to soothe, it must be from the will\nOf some great God, so caring to fulfil\nThe word of prophecy, lest he should bend\nOn Troy the shaft no mortal may forfend,\nBefore the arrival of Troy’s destined hour,\nWhen she must fall, o’er-mastered by their power.\nCH. 1. Hush, my son!III 1\nNEO. Why so?\nCH. 1. A sound\nGendered of some mortal woe,\n[page 223][205-237]Started from the neighbouring ground.\nHere, or there? Ah! now I know.\nHark! ’tis the voice of one in pain,\nTravelling hardly, the deep strain\nOf human anguish, all too clear,\nThat smites my heart, that wounds mine ear.\nCH. 2. From far it peals. But thou, my son!III 2\nNEO. What?\nCH. 2. Think again. He moveth nigh:\nHe holds the region: not with tone\nOf piping shepherd’s rural minstrelsy,\nBut belloweth his far cry,\nStumbling perchance with mortal pain,\nOr else in wild amaze,\nAs he our ship surveys\nUnwonted on the inhospitable main.\nEnter PHILOCTETES.\nPHILOCTETES. Ho!\nWhat men are ye that to this desert shore,\nHarbourless, uninhabited, are come\nOn shipboard? Of what country or what race\nShall I pronounce ye? For your outward garb\nIs Grecian, ever dearest to this heart\nThat hungers now to hear your voices’ tune.\nAh! do not fear me, do not shrink away\nFrom my wild looks: but, pitying one so poor,\nForlorn and desolate in nameless woe,\nSpeak, if with friendly purpose ye are come.\nOh answer! ’Tis not meet that I should lose\nThis kindness from your lips, or ye from mine.\nNEO. Then know this first, O stranger, as thou wouldest,\nThat we are Greeks.\nPHI. O dear, dear name! Ah me!\nIn all these years, once, only once, I hear it!\nMy son, what fairest gale hath wafted thee?\nWhat need hath brought thee to the shore? What mission?\n[page 224][238-273]Declare all this, that I may know thee well.\nNEO. The sea-girt Scyros is my native home.\nThitherward I make voyage:—Achilles’ son,\nNamed Neoptolemus.—I have told thee all.\nPHI. Dear is that shore to me, dear is thy father\nO ancient Lycomedes’ foster-child,\nWhence cam’st thou hither? How didst thou set forth?\nNEO. From Troy we made our course in sailing hither.\nPHI. How? Sure thou wast not with us, when at first\nWe launched our vessels on the Troyward way?\nNEO. Hadst thou a share in that adventurous toil?\nPHI. And know’st thou not whom thou behold’st in me,\nYoung boy?\nNEO. How should I know him whom I ne’er\nSet eye on?\nPHI. Hast not even heard my name,\nNor echoing rumour of my ruinous woe?\nNEO. Nay, I know nought of all thy questioning.\nPHI. How full of griefs am I, how Heaven-abhorred,\nWhen of my piteous state no faintest sound\nHath reached my home, or any Grecian land!\nBut they, who pitilessly cast me forth,\nKeep silence and are glad, while this my plague\nBlooms ever, and is strengthened more and more.\nBoy, great Achilles’ offspring, in this form\nThou seest the man, of whom, methinks, erewhile\nThou hast been told, to whom the Hercúlean bow\nDescended, Philoctetes, Poeas’ son;\nWhom the two generals and the Ithacan king\nCast out thus shamefully forlorn, afflicted\nWith the fierce malady and desperate wound\nMade by the cruel basilisk’s murderous tooth.\nWith this for company they left me, child!\nExposed upon this shore, deserted, lone.\nFrom seaward Chrysa came they with their fleet\nAnd touched at Lemnos. I had fallen to rest\nFrom the long tossing, in a shadowy cave\nOn yonder cliff by the shore. Gladly they saw,\nAnd left me, having set forth for my need,\n[page 225][273-314]Poor man, some scanty rags, and a thin store\nOf provender. Such food be theirs, I pray!\nImagine, O my son, when they were gone,\nWhat wakening, what arising, then was mine;\nWhat weeping, what lamenting of my woe!\nWhen I beheld the ships, wherewith I sailed,\nGone, one and all! and no man in the place,\nNone to bestead me, none to comfort me\nIn my sore sickness. And where’er I looked,\nNought but distress was present with me still.\nNo lack of that, for one thing!—Ah! my son,\nTime passed, and there I found myself alone\nWithin my narrow lodging, forced to serve\nEach pressing need. For body’s sustenance\nThis bow supplied me with sufficient store,\nWounding the feathered doves, and when the shaft,\nFrom the tight string, had struck, myself, ay me!\nDragging this foot, would crawl to my swift prey.\nThen water must be fetched, and in sharp frost\nWood must be found and broken,—all by me.\nNor would fire come unbidden, but with flint\nFrom flints striking dim sparks, I hammered forth\nThe struggling flame that keeps the life in me.\nFor houseroom with the single help of fire\nGives all I need, save healing for my sore.\nNow learn, my son, the nature of this isle.\nNo mariner puts in here willingly.\nFor it hath neither moorage, nor sea-port,\nFor traffic or kind shelter or good cheer.\nNot hitherward do prudent men make voyage.\nPerchance one may have touched against his will.\nMany strange things may happen in long time.\nThese, when they come, in words have pitied me,\nAnd given me food, or raiment, in compassion.\nBut none is willing, when I speak thereof,\nTo take me safely home. Wherefore I pine\nNow this tenth year, in famine and distress,\nFeeding the hunger of my ravenous plague.\nSuch deeds, my son, the Atridae, and the might\nOf sage Odysseus, have performed on me.\n[page 226][315-349]Wherefore may all the Olympian gods, one day,\nPlague them with stern requital for my wrong!\nCH. Methinks my feeling for thee, Poeas’ child,\nIs like that of thy former visitants.\nNEO. I, too, a witness to confirm his words,\nKnow them for verities, since I have found\nThe Atridae and Odysseus evil men.\nPHI. Art thou, too, wroth with the all-pestilent sons\nOf Atreus? Have they given thee cause to grieve?\nNEO. Would that my hand might ease the wrath I feel!\nThen Sparta and Mycenae should be ware\nThat Scyros too breeds valiant sons for war.\nPHI. Brave youth! I love thee. Tell me the great cause\nWhy thou inveighest against them with such heat?\nNEO. O son of Poeas, hardly shall I tell\nWhat outrage I endured when I had come;\nYet I will speak it. When the fate of death\nO’ertook Achilles—\nPHI. Out, alas! no more!\nHold, till thou first hast made me clearly know,\nIs Peleus’ offspring dead?\nNEO. Alas! he is,\nSlain by no mortal, felled by Phoebus’ shaft:\nSo men reported—\nPHI. Well, right princely was he!\nAnd princely is he who slew him. Shall I mourn\nHim first, or wait till I have heard thy tale?\nNEO. Methinks thou hast thyself enough to mourn,\nWithout the burden of another’s woe.\nPHI. Well spoken. Then renew thine own complaint,\nAnd tell once more wherein they insulted thee.\nNEO. There came to fetch me, in a gallant ship,\nOdysseus and the fosterer of my sire,\nSaying, whether soothly, or in idle show,\nThat, since my father perished, it was known\nNone else but I should take Troy’s citadel.\nSuch words from them, my friend, thou may’st believe,\nHeld me not long from making voyage with speed,\n[page 227][350-385]Chiefly through longing for my father’s corse,\nTo see him yet unburied,—for I ne’er\nHad seen him. Then, besides, ’twas a fair cause,\nIf, by my going, I should vanquish Troy.\nOne day I had sailed, and on the second came\nTo sad Sigeum with wind-favoured speed,\nWhen straightway all the host, surrounding me\nAs I set foot on shore, saluted me,\nAnd swore the dead Achilles was in life,\nTheir eyes being witness, when they looked on me.\nHe lay there in his shroud: but I, unhappy,\nSoon ending lamentation for the dead,\nWent near to those Atridae, as to friends,\nTo obtain my father’s armour and all else\nThat had been his. And then,—alas the while,\nThat men should be so hard!—they spake this word:\n‘Seed of Achilles, thou may’st freely take\nAll else thy father owned, but for those arms,\nAnother wields them now, Laërtes’ son.’\nTears rushed into mine eyes, and in hot wrath\nI straightway rose, and bitterly outspake:\n‘O miscreant! What? And have ye dared to give\nMine arms to some man else, unknown to me?’\nThen said Odysseus, for he chanced to be near,\n‘Yea, child, and justly have they given me these.\nI saved them and their master in the field.’\nThen in fierce anger all at once I launched\nAll terms of execration at his head,\nBating no word, being maddened by the thought\nThat I should lose this heirloom,—and to him!\nHe, at this pass, though not of wrathful mood,\nStung by such utterance, made rejoinder thus:\n‘Thou wast not with us here, but wrongfully\nDidst bide afar. And, since thou mak’st so bold,\nI tell thee, never shalt thou, as thou sayest,\nSail with these arms to Scyros.’—Thus reviled,\nWith such an evil echo in mine ear,\nI voyage homeward, robbed of mine own right\nBy that vile offset of an evil tree.\nYet less I blame him than the men in power.\n[page 228][386-423]For every multitude, be it army or state,\nTakes tone from those who rule it, and all taint\nOf disobedience from bad counsel springs.\nI have spoken. May the Atridae’s enemy\nBe dear to Heaven, as he is loved by me!\nCH. Mother of mightiest Zeus,1\nFeeder of all that live,\nWho from thy mountainous breast\nRivers of gold dost give!\nTo thee, O Earth, I cried that shameful day,\nWhen insolence from Atreus’ sons went forth\nFull on our lord: when they bestowed away\nHis father’s arms to crown Odysseus’ worth;\nThou, whom bull-slaughtering lions yoked bear,\nO mighty mother, hear!\nPHI. Your coming is commended by a grief\nThat makes you kindly welcome. For I feel\nA chord that vibrates to your voice, and tells,\nThus have Odysseus and the Atridae wrought.\nFull well I know, Odysseus’ poisoned tongue\nShrinks from no mischief nor no guileful word\nThat leads to bad achievement in the end.\nThis moves not my main marvel, but if one\nSaw this and bore it,—Aias of the shield.\nNEO. Ah, friend, he was no more. Had he but lived,\nThis robbery had ne’er been wrought on me.\nPHI. What? Is he too departed?\nNEO. He is dead.\nThe light no more beholds him.\nPHI. Oh! alas!\nBut Tydeus’ offspring, and the rascal birth\nLaërtes bought of Sisyphus, they live:\nI know it. For their death were to be wished.\nNEO. Yea, be assured, they live and flourish high\nExalted in the host of Argive men.\nPHI. And Nestor, my old friend, good aged man,\nIs he yet living? Oft he would prevent\nTheir evils, by the wisdom of his thought.\n[page 229][424-461]NEO. He too is now in trouble, having lost\nAntilochus, the comfort of his age.\nPHI. There, there! In one brief word thou hast revealed\nThe mournful case of twain, whom I would last\nHave chosen to hear of as undone. Ah me!\nWhere must one look? when these are dead, and he,\nOdysseus, lives,—and in a time like this,\nThat craves their presence, and his death for theirs.\nNEO. He wrestles cleverly; but, O my friend,\nEven ablest wits are ofttimes snared at last.\nPHI. Tell me, I pray, what was become of him,\nPatroclus, whom thy father loved so well?\nNEO. He, too, was gone. I’ll teach thee in a word\nOne truth for all. War doth not willingly\nSnatch off the wicked, but still takes the good.\nPHI. True! and to prove thy saying, I will inquire\nThe fate of a poor dastard, of mean worth,\nBut ever shrewd and nimble with his tongue.\nNEO. Whom but Odysseus canst thou mean by this?\nPHI. I meant not him. But there was one Thersites,\nWho ne’er made conscience to stint speech, where all\nCried ‘Silence!’ Is he living, dost thou know?\nNEO. I saw him not, but knew he was alive.\nPHI. He must be: for no evil yet was crushed.\nThe Heavens will ever shield it. ’Tis their sport\nTo turn back all things rancorous and malign\nFrom going down to the grave, and send instead\nThe good and true. Oh, how shall we commend\nSuch dealings, how defend them? When I praise\nThings god-like, I find evil in the Gods.\nNEO. I, O thou child of a Trachinian sire,\nHenceforth will take good care, from far away\nTo look on Troy and Atreus’ children twain.\nYea, where the trickster lords it o’er the just,\nAnd goodness languishes and rascals rule,\n—Such courses I will nevermore endure.\nBut rock-bound Scyros henceforth shall suffice\nTo yield me full contentment in my home.\nNow, to my vessel! And thou, Poeas’ child,\n[page 230][462-499]Farewell, right heartily farewell! May Heaven\nGrant thy desire, and rid thee of thy plague!\nLet us be going, that when God shall give\nFair voyage, that moment we may launch away.\nPHI. My son, are ye now setting forth?\nNEO. Our time\nBids us go near and look to sail erelong.\nPHI. Now, by thy father, by thy mother,—nay,\nBy all thy love e’er cherished in thy home,\nSuppliant I beg thee, leave me not thus lone,\nForlorn in all my misery which thou seest,\nIn all thou hast heard of here surrounding me!\nStow me with other freightage. Full of care,\nI know, and burdensome the charge may prove.\nYet venture! Surely to the noble mind\nAll shame is hateful and all kindness blest.\nAnd shame would be thy meed, didst thou fail here\nBut, doing this, thou shalt have glorious fame,\nWhen I return alive to Oeta’s vale.\nCome, ’tis the labour not of one whole day.\nSo thou durst take me, fling me where thou wilt\nO’ the ship, in hold, prow, stern, or wheresoe’er\nI least may trouble those on board with me.\nAh! by great Zeus, the suppliant’s friend, comply,\nMy son, be softened! See, where I am fall’n\nThus on my knees before thee, though so weak,\nCrippled and powerless. Ah! forsake me not\nThus far from human footstep. Take me, take me!\nIf only to thy home, or to the town\nOf old Chalcodon in Euboea.—From thence\nI have not far to Oeta, and the ridge\nOf Trachis, and Spercheius’ lordly flood.\nSo thou shalt bless my father with my sight.\nAnd yet long since I fear he may be gone.\nFor oft I sent him suppliant prayers by men\nWho touched this isle, entreating him to fetch\nAnd bear me safely home with his own crew.\nBut either he is dead, or else, methinks,\nIt well may be, my messengers made light\nOf my concerns, and hastened onward home.\n[page 231][500-536]But now in thee I find both messenger\nAnd convoy, thou wilt pity me and save.\nFor, well thou knowest, danger never sleeps,\nAnd fear of dark reverse is always nigh.\nMortals, when free, should look where mischief lurks,\nAnd in their happiest hour consider well\nTheir life, lest ruin unsuspected come.\nCH. Pity him, O my king!2\nMany a crushing woe\nHe telleth, such as I pray\nNone of my friends may know.\nAnd if, dear master, thou mislikest sore\nYon cruel-hearted lordly pair, I would,\nTurning their plan of evil to his good,\nOn swift ship bear him to his native shore,\nMeeting his heart’s desire; and free thy path\nFrom fear of heavenly wrath.\nNEO. Thou mak’st small scruple here; but be advised:\nLest, when this plague on board shall weary thee,\nThy voice should alter from this liberal tone.\nCH. No, truly! Fear not thou shalt ever have\nJust cause to utter such reproach on me.\nNEO. Then sure ’twere shame, should I more backward prove\nThan thou, to labour for the stranger’s need.\nCome, if thou wilt, let us make voyage, and he,\nLet him set forth with speed. Our ship shall take him.\nHe shall not be refused. Only may Heaven\nLead safely hence and to our destined port!\nPHI. O morning full of brightness! Kindest friend,\nSweet mariners, how can I make you feel,\nIn act, how dearly from my heart I love you!\nYe have won my soul. Let us be gone, my son,—\nFirst having said farewell to this poor cave,\nMy homeless dwelling-place, that thou may’st know,\nHow barely I have lived, how firm my heart!\nMethinks another could not have endured\n[page 232][537-572]The very sight of what I bore. But I\nThrough strong necessity have conquered pain.\nCH. Stay: let us understand. There come two men\nA stranger, with a shipmate of thy crew.\nWhen ye have heard them, ye may then go in.\nEnter Messenger, disguised as a merchantman.\nMERCHANTMAN. Son of Achilles, my companion here,\nWho with two more remained to guard thy ship,\nAgreed to help me find thee where thou wert,\nSince unexpectedly, through fortune’s will,\nI meet thee, mooring by the self-same shore.\nFor like a merchantman, with no great sail,\nMaking my course from Ilion to my home,\nGrape-clustered Peparethos, when I heard\nThe mariners declare that one and all\nWere of thy crew, I would not launch again,\nWithout a word, till we had told our news.—\nMethinks thou knowest nought of thine own case,\nWhat new devices of the Argive chiefs\nSurround thee; nor devices only now,\nBut active deeds, no longer unperformed.\nNEO. Well, stranger, for the kindness thou hast shown,—\nElse were I base,—my heart must thank thee still.\nBut tell me what thou meanest, that I may learn\nWhat new-laid plot thou bring’st me from the camp.\nMER. Old Phoenix, Acamas and Demophon\nAre gone in thy pursuit with ships and men.\nNEO. To bring me back with reasons or perforce?\nMER. I know not. What I heard, I am here to tell.\nNEO. How? And is this in act? Are they set forth\nTo please the Atridae, Phoenix and the rest?\nMER. The thing is not to do, but doing now.\nNEO. What kept Odysseus back, if this be so,\nFrom going himself? Had he some cause for fear?\nMER. He and the son of Tydeus, when our ship\nHoist sail, were gone to fetch another man.\nNEO. For whom could he himself be sailing forth?\n[page 233][573-607]MER. For some one,—but first tell me, whispering low\nWhate’er thou speakest,—who is this I see?\nNEO. (speaking aloud).\nThis, sir, is Philoctetes the renowned.\nMER. (aside to NEOPTOLEMUS).\nWithout more question, snatch thyself away\nAnd sail forth from this land.\nPHI. What saith he, boy?\nThrough what dark traffic is the mariner\nBetraying me with whispering in thine ear?\nNEO. I have not caught it, but whate’er he speaks\nHe must speak openly to us and thee.\nMER. Seed of Achilles, let me not offend\nThe army by my words! Full many a boon,\nBeing poor, I reap from them for service done.\nNEO. The Atridae are my foes; the man you see\nIs my fast friend, because he hates them sore.\nThen, if you come in kindness, you must hide\nNothing from him or me of all thou hast heard.\nMER. Look what thou doest, my son!\nNEO. I mark it well.\nMER. Thou shalt be answerable.\nNEO. Content: but speak.\nMER. Then hear me. These two men whom I have named,\nDiomedes and Odysseus, are set forth\nEngaged on oath to bring this man by force\nIf reasons fail. The Achaeans every one\nHave heard this plainly from Odysseus’ mouth.\nHe was the louder and more confident.\nNEO. Say, for what cause, after so long a time,\nCan Atreus’ sons have turned their thoughts on him,\nWhom long they had cast forth? What passing touch\nOf conscience moved them, or what stroke from Heaven,\nWhose wrath requites all wicked deeds of men?\nMER. Methinks thou hast not heard what I will now\nUnfold to thee. There was a princely seer,\nA son of Priam, Helenus by name,\nWhom he for whom no word is bad enough,\n[page 234][608-645]Crafty Odysseus, sallying forth alone\nOne night, had taken, and in bonds displayed\n‘Fore all the Achaeans, a right noble prey.\nHe, ’mid his other prophecies, foretold\nNo Grecian force should sack Troy’s citadel,\nTill with fair reasons they had brought this man\nFrom Lemnos isle, his lonely dwelling-place.\nWhen thus the prophet spake, Laërtes’ son\nStraight undertook to fetch this man, and show him\nTo all the camp:—he hoped, with fair consent:\nBut else, perforce.—And, if he failed in this,\nWhoever would might smite him on the head.\nMy tale is told, dear youth. I counsel speed\nTo thee and to the friend for whom thou carest.\nPHI. Ah me, unhappy! has that rascal knave\nSworn to fetch me with reasons to their camp?\nAs likely might his reasons bring me back,\nLike his begetter, from the house of death.\nMER. You talk of what I know not. I will go\nShipward. May God be with you for all good.[Exit\nPHI. Is not this terrible, Laërtes’ son\nShould ever think to bring me with soft words\nAnd show me from his deck to all their host?\nNo! Sooner will I listen to the tongue\nOf the curs’d basilisk that thus hath maim’d me.\nAy, but he’ll venture anything in word\nOr deed. And now I know he will be here.\nCome, O my son, let us be gone, while seas\nAnd winds divide us from Odysseus’ ship.\nLet us depart. Sure timely haste brings rest\nAnd quiet slumber when the toil is done.\nNEO. Shall we not sail when this south-western wind\nHath fallen, that now is adverse to our course?\nPHI. All winds are fair to him who flies from woe.\nNEO. Nay, but this head-wind hinders them no less.\nPHI. No head-wind hinders pirates on their way,\nWhen violence and rapine lead them on.\nNEO. Well, then, let us be going, if you will;\n[page 235][646-675]When you have taken from within the cave\nWhat most you need and value.\nPHI. Though my all\nBe little, there is that I may not lose.\nNEO. What can there be that we have not on board?\nPHI. A leaf I have found, wherewith I still the rage\nOf my sore plague, and lull it quite to rest.\nNEO. Well, bring it forth.—What? Is there something more?\nPHI. If any of these arrows here are fallen,\nI would not leave them for a casual prey.\nNEO. How? Do I see thee with the marvellous bow?\nPHI. Here in my hand. The world hath only one.\nNEO. And may one touch and handle it, and gaze\nWith reverence, as on a thing from Heaven?\nPHI. Thou mayest, my son. This and whate’er of mine\nMay stead thee, ’tis thy privilege to enjoy.\nNEO. In very truth I long for it, but so,\nThat longing waits on leave. Am I permitted?\nPHI. Thou art, my son,—and well thou speakest,—thou art.\nThou, that hast given me light and life, the joy\nOf seeing Mount Oeta and my father’s home,\nWith all I love there, and his aged head,—\nThou that hast raised me far above my foes\nWho triumphed! Thou may’st take it in thine hand,\nAnd,—when thou hast given it back to me,—may’st vaunt\nAlone of mortals for thine excellence\nTo have held this in thy touch. I, too, at first,\nReceived it as a boon for kindness done.\nNEO. Well, go within.\nPHI. Nay, I must take thee too.\nMy sickness craves thee for its comforter.\n[PHILOCTETES and NEOPTOLEMUS go into the cave\n[page 236][676-711]\nCHORUS.\nIn fable I have heard,I 1\nThough sight hath ne’er confirmed the word,\nHow he who attempted once the couch supreme,\nTo a whirling wheel by Zeus the all-ruler bound,\nTied head and heel, careering ever round,\nAtones his impious unsubstantial dream.\nOf no man else, through eye or ear,\nHave I discerned a fate more full of fear\nThan yonder sufferer’s of the cureless wound:\nWho did no violence, defrauded none:—\nA just man, had he dwelt among the just\nUnworthily behold him thrust\nAlone to hear the billows roar\nThat break around a rugged shore!\nHow could he live, whose life was thus consumed with moan?\nWhere neighbour there was none:I 2\nNo arm to stay him wandering lone,\nUnevenly, with stumbling steps and sore;\nNo friend in need, no kind inhabitant,\nTo minister to his importunate want,\nNo heart whereto his pangs he might deplore.\nNone who, whene’er the gory flow\nWas rushing hot, might healing herbs bestow,\nOr cull from teeming Earth some genial plant\nTo allay the anguish of malignant pain\nAnd soothe the sharpness of his poignant woe.\nLike infant whom the nurse lets go,\nWith tottering movement here and there,\nHe crawled for comfort, whensoe’er\nHis soul-devouring plague relaxed its cruel strain.\nNot fed with foison of all-teeming EarthII 1\nWhence we sustain us, ever-toiling men,\nBut only now and then\nWith wingèd things, by his wing’d shafts brought low,\nHe stayed his hunger from his bow.\n[page 237][712-749]Poor soul, that never through ten years of dearth\nHad pleasure from the fruitage of the vine,\nBut seeking to some standing pool,\nNor clear nor cool,\nFoul water heaved to head for lack of heartening wine.\nBut now, consorted with the hero’s child,II 2\nHe winneth greatness and a joyful change;\nOver the water wild\nBorne by a friendly bark beneath the range\nOf Oeta, where Spercheius fills\nWide channels winding among lovely hills\nHaunted of Melian nymphs, till he espies\nThe roof-tree of his father’s hall,\nAnd high o’er all\nShines the bronze shield of him, whose home is in the skies.\n[NEOPTOLEMUS comes out of the cave, followed by PHILOCTETES in pain\nNEO. Prithee, come on! Why dost thou stand aghast,\nVoiceless, and thus astonied in thine air?\nPHI. Oh! oh!\nNEO. What?\nPHI. Nothing. Come my son, fear nought.\nNEO. Is pain upon thee? Hath thy trouble come?\nPHI. No pain, no pain! ’Tis past; I am easy now.\nYe heavenly powers!\nNEO. Why dost thou groan aloud,\nAnd cry to Heaven?\nPHI. To come and save. Kind Heaven!\nOh, oh!\nNEO. What is ’t? Why silent? Wilt not speak?\nI see thy misery.\nPHI. Oh! I am lost, my son!\nI cannot hide it from you. Oh! it shoots,\nIt pierces. Oh unhappy! Oh! my woe!\nI am lost, my son, I am devoured. Oh me!\nOh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Pain! pain! Oh pain! oh pain!\nChild, if a sword be to thine hand, smite hard,\nShear off my foot! heed not my life! Quick, come!\n[page 238][751-786]NEO. What hath so suddenly arisen, that thus\nThou mak’st ado and groanest o’er thyself?\nPHI. Thou knowest.\nNEO. What know I?\nPHI. O! thou knowest, my son!\nNEO. I know not.\nPHI. How? Not know? Ah me! Pain, pain!\nNEO. Thy plague is a sore burden, heavy and sore.\nPHI. Sore? ’Tis unutterable. Have pity on me!\nNEO. What shall I do?\nPHI. Do not in fear forsake me.\nThis wandering evil comes in force again,\nHungry as ere it fed.\nNEO. O hapless one!\nThrice hapless in thy manifold distress!\nWhat wilt thou? Shall I raise thee on mine arm?\nPHI. Nay, but receiving from my hand the bow,\nAs late thou didst desire me, keep it safe\nAnd guard it, till the fury of my pain\nPass over me and cease. For when ’tis spent,\nSlumber will seize me, else it ne’er would end.\nI must sleep undisturbed. But if meanwhile\nThey come,—by Heaven I charge thee, in no wise,\nWillingly nor perforce, let them have this!\nElse thou wilt be the slayer of us both;\nOf me thy suppliant, and of thyself.\nNEO. Fear not my care. No hand shall hold these arms\nBut thine and mine. Give, and Heaven bless the deed!\nPHI. I give them; there, my son! But look to Heaven\nAnd pray no envy smite thee, nor such bane\nIn having them, as fell on me and him\nWho bore them formerly.\nNEO. O grant it, Gods!\nAnd grant us fair and happy voyage, where’er\nOur course is shaped and righteous Heaven shall guide.\nPHI. Ah! but I fear, my son, thy prayer is vain:\nFor welling yet again from depths within,\nThis gory ooze is dripping. It will come!\nI know it will. O, foot, torn helpless thing,\n[page 239][786-816]What wilt thou do to me? Ah! ah! It comes,\nIt is at hand. ’Tis here! Woe’s me, undone!\nI have shown you all. Stay near me. Go not far:\nAh! ah!\nO island king, I would this agony\nMight cleave thy bosom through and through! Woe, woe!\nWoe! Ah! ye two commanders of the host,\nAgamemnon, Menelaüs, O that ye,\nAnother ten years’ durance in my room\nMight nurse this malady! O Death, Death, Death!\nI call thee daily—wilt thou never come?\nWill it not be?—My son, thou noble boy,\nIf thou art noble, take and burn me there\nAloft in yon all-worshipped Lemnian fire!\nYea, when the bow thou keep’st was my reward,\nI did like service for the child of Heaven.\nHow now, my son?\nWhat say’st? Art silent? Where—where art thou, boy?\nNEO. My heart is full, and groaning o’er thy woes.\nPHI. Nay, yet have comfort. This affliction oft\nGoes no less swiftly than it came. I pray thee,\nStand fast and leave me not alone!\nNEO. Fear nought.\nWe will not stir.\nPHI. Wilt thou remain?\nNEO. Be sure of it.\nPHI. I’ll not degrade thee with an oath, my son.\nNEO. Rest satisfied. I may not go without thee.\nPHI. Thy hand, to pledge me that!\nNEO. There, I will stay.\nPHI. Now, now, aloft!\nNEO. Where mean’st thou?\nPHI. Yonder aloft!\nNEO. Whither? Thou rav’st. Why starest thou at the sky?\nPHI. Now, let me go.\nNEO. Where?\nPHI. Let me go, I say!\n[page 240][817-847]NEO. I will not.\nPHI. You will kill me. Let me go!\nNEO. Well, thou know’st best I hold thee not.\nPHI. O Earth,\nI die. receive me to thy breast! This pain\nSubdues me utterly, I cannot stand.\nNEO. Methinks he will be fast in slumber soon\nThat head sinks backward, and a clammy sweat\nBathes all his limbs, while from his foot hath burst\nA vein, dark bleeding. Let us leave him, friends,\nIn quietness, till he hath fallen to sleep.\nCHORUS\nLord of the happiest life,I\nSleep, thou that know’st not strife,\nThat know’st not grief,\nStill wafting sure relief,\nCome, saviour now!\nThy healing balm is spread\nOver this pain worn head,\nQuench not the beam that gives calm to his brow.\nLook, O my lord, to thy path,\nEither to go or to stay\nHow is my thought to proceed?\nWhat is our cause for delay?\nLook! Opportunity’s power,\nFitting the task to the hour,\nGiveth the race to the swift.\nNEO. He hears not. But I see that to have ta’en\nHis bow without him were a bootless gain\nHe must sail with us. So the god hath said\nHeaven hath decreed this garland for his head:\nAnd to have failed with falsehood were a meed\nOf shameful soilure for a shameless deed.\nCH. God shall determine the end—II\nBut for thine answer, friend,\nWaft soft words low!\nAll sick men’s sleep, we know,\n[page 241][848-879]Hath open eye;\nTheir quickly ruffling mind\nQuivers in lightest wind,\nSleepless in slumber new danger to spy.\nThink, O my lord, of thy path,\nSecretly look forth afar,\nWhat wilt thou do for thy need?\nHow with the wise wilt thou care?\nIf toward the nameless thy heart\nChooseth this merciful part,\nHuge are the dangers that drift.\nThe wind is fair, my son, the wind is fair,\nThe man is dark and helpless, stretched in night.\n(O kind, warm sleep that calmest human care!)\nPowerless of hand and foot and ear and sight,\nBlind, as one lying in the house of death.\n(Think well if here thou utterest timely breath.)\nThis, O my son, is all my thought can find,\nBest are the toils that without frightening bind.\nNEO. Hush! One word more were madness. He revives.\nHis eye hath motion. He uplifts his head.\nPHI. Fair daylight following sleep, and ye, dear friends,\nFaithful beyond all hope in tending me!\nI never could have dreamed that thou, dear youth,\nCouldst thus have borne my sufferings and stood near\nSo full of pity to relieve my pain.\nNot so the worthy generals of the host;—\nThis princely patience was not theirs to show.\nOnly thy noble nature, nobly sprung,\nMade light of all the trouble, though oppressed\nWith fetid odours and unceasing cries.\nAnd now, since this my plague would seem to yield\nSome pause and brief forgetfulness of pain,\nWith thine own hand, my son, upraise me here,\nAnd set me on my feet, that, when my strength\n[page 242][880-913]After exhaustion shall return again,\nWe may move shoreward and launch forth with speed.\nNEO. I feel unhoped-for gladness when I see\nThy painless gaze, and hear thy living breath,\nFor thine appearance and surroundings both\nWere deathlike. But arise! Or, if thou wilt,\nThese men shall raise thee. For they will not shrink\nFrom toil which thou and I at once enjoin.\nPHI. Right, right, my son! But lift me thine own self,\nAs I am sure thou meanest. Let these be,\nLest they be burdened with the noisome smell\nBefore the time. Enough for them to bear\nThe trouble on board.\nNEO. I will; stand up, endure!\nPHI. Fear not. Old habit will enable me.\nNEO. O me!\nWhat shall I do? Now ’tis my turn to exclaim!\nPHI. What canst thou mean? What change is here, my son?\nNEO. I know not how to shift the troublous word.\n’Tis hopeless.\nPHI. What is hopeless? Speak not so,\nDear child!\nNEO. But so my wretched lot hath fallen.\nPHI. Ah! Can it be, the offence of my disease\nHath moved thee not to take me now on board?\nNEO. All is offence to one who hath forced himself\nFrom the true bent to an unbecoming deed.\nPHI. Nought misbecoming to thyself or sire\nDoest thou or speak’st, befriending a good man.\nNEO. My baseness will appear. That wrings my soul.\nPHI. Not in thy deeds. But for thy words, I fear me!\nNEO. O Heaven! Must double vileness then be mine\nBoth shameful silence and most shameful speech?\nPHI. Or my discernment is at fault, or thou\nMean’st to betray me and make voyage without me.\nNEO. Nay, not without thee, there is my distress!\nLest I convey thee to thy bitter grief.\n[page 243][914-946]PHI. How? How, dear youth? I do not understand.\nNEO. Here I unveil it. Thou art to sail to Troy,\nTo join the chieftains and the Achaean host.\nPHI. What do I hear? Ah!\nNEO. Grieve not till you learn.\nPHI. Learn what? What wilt thou make of me? What mean’st thou?\nNEO. First to release thee from this plague, and then\nWith thee to go and take the realm of Troy.\nPHI. And is this thine intent?\nNEO. ’Tis so ordained\nUnchangeably. Be not dismayed! ’Tis so.\nPHI. Me miserable! I am betrayed, undone!\nWhat guile is here? My bow! give back my bow!\nNEO. I may not. Interest, and duty too,\nForce me to obey commandment.\nPHI. O thou fire,\nThou terror of the world! Dark instrument\nOf ever-hateful guile!—What hast thou done?\nHow thou hast cheated me! Art not ashamed\nTo look on him that sued to thee for shelter?\nO heart of stone, thou hast stolen my life away\nWith yonder bow!—Ah, yet I beg of thee,\nGive it me back, my son, I entreat thee, give!\nBy all thy father worshipped, rob me not\nOf life!—Ah me! Now he will speak no more,\nBut turns away, obdúrate to retain it.\nO ye, my comrades in this wilderness,\nRude creatures of the rocks, O promontories,\nCreeks, precipices of the hills, to you\nAnd your familiar presence I complain\nOf this foul trespass of Achilles’ son.\nSworn to convey me home, to Troy he bears me.\nAnd under pledge of his right hand hath ta’en\nAnd holds from me perforce my wondrous bow,\nThe sacred gift of Zeus-born Heracles,\nThinking to wave it midst the Achaean host\nTriumphantly for his. In conquering me\nHe vaunts as of some valorous feat, and knows not\nHe is spoiling a mere corse, an empty dream,\n[page 244][947-980]The shadow of a vapour. In my strength\nHe ne’er had vanquished me. Even as I am,\nHe could not, but by guile. Now, all forlorn,\nI am abused, deceived. What must I do?\nNay, give it me. Nay, yet be thy true self!\nThou art silent. I am lost. O misery!\nRude face of rock, back I return to thee\nAnd thy twin gateway, robbed of arms and food,\nTo wither in thy cave companionless:—\nNo more with these mine arrows to destroy\nOr flying bird or mountain-roving beast.\nBut, all unhappy! I myself must be\nThe feast of those on whom I fed, the chase\nOf that I hunted, and shall dearly pay\nIn bloody quittance for their death, through one\nWho seemed all ignorant of sinful guile.\nPerish,—not till I am certain if thy heart\nWill change once more,—if not, my curse on thee!\nCH. What shall we do, my lord? We wait thy word\nOr to sail now, or yield to his desire.\nNEO. My heart is pressed with a strange pity for him,\nNot now beginning, but long since begun.\nPHI. Ay, pity me, my son! by all above,\nMake not thy name a scorn by wronging me!\nNEO. O! I am troubled sore. What must I do?\nWould I had never left mine island home!\nPHI. Thou art not base, but seemest to have learnt\nSome baseness from base men. Now, as ’tis meet,\nBe better guided—leave me mine arms, and go.\nNEO. (to Chorus).\nWhat shall we do?\nEnter ODYSSEUS.\nODYSSEUS. What art thou doing, knave?\nGive me that bow, and haste thee back again.\nPHI. Alas! What do I hear? Odysseus’ voice?\nOD. Be sure of that, Odysseus, whom thou seest.\nPHI. Oh, I am bought and sold, undone! ’Twas he\nThat kidnapped me, and robbed me of my bow.\nOD. Yea. I deny it not. Be sure, ’twas I.\n[page 245][981-1015]PHI. Give back, my son, the bow; release it!\nOD. That,\nThough he desire it, he shall never do.\nThou too shalt march along, or these shall force thee.\nPHI. They force me! O thou boldest of bad men!\nThey force me?\nOD. If thou com’st not willingly.\nPHI. O Lemnian earth and thou almighty flame,\nHephaestos’ workmanship, shall this be borne,\nThat he by force must drag me from your care?\nOD. ’Tis Zeus, I tell thee, monarch of this isle,\nWho thus hath willed. I am his minister.\nPHI. Wretch, what vile words thy wit hath power to say!\nThe gods are liars when invoked by thee.\nOD. Nay, ’tis their truth compels thee to this voyage.\nPHI. I will not have it so.\nOD. I will. Thou shalt.\nPHI. Woe for my wretchedness! My father, then,\nBegat no freeman, but a slave in me.\nOD. Nay, but the peer of noblest men, with whom\nThou art to take and ravage Troy with might.\nPHI. Never,—though I must suffer direst woe,—\nWhile this steep Lemnian ground is mine to tread!\nOD. What now is thine intent?\nPHI. Down from the crag\nThis head shall plunge and stain the crag beneath.\nOD. (to the Attendants.)\nAy, seize and bind him. Baffle him in this.\nPHI. Poor hands, for lack of your beloved string,\nCaught by this craven! O corrupted soul!\nHow thou hast undermined me, having taken\nTo screen thy quest this youth to me unknown,\nFar worthier of my friendship than of thine,\nWho knew no better than to obey command.\nEven now ’tis manifest he burns within\nWith pain for his own error and my wrong.\nBut, though unwilling and mapt for ill,\nThy crafty, mean, and cranny spying soul\nToo well hath lessoned him in sinful lore.\n[page 246][1016-1052]Now thou hast bound me, O thou wretch, and thinkest\nTo take me from this coast, where thou didst cast me\nOutlawed and desolate, a corpse ’mongst men.\nOh!\nI curse thee now, as ofttimes in the past:\nBut since Heaven yields me nought but bitterness,\nThou livest and art blithe, while ’tis my pain\nTo live on in my misery, laughed to scorn\nBy thee and Atreus’ sons, those generals twain\nWhom thou art serving in this chase. But thou\nWith strong compulsion and deceit was driven\nTroyward, whilst I, poor victim, of free will\nTook my seven ships and sailed there, yet was thrown\nFar from all honour,—as thou sayest, by them,\nBut, as they turn the tale, by thee.—And now\nWhy fetch me hence and take me? To what end?\nI am nothing, dead to you this many a year.\nHow, O thou Heaven-abhorred! am I not now\nLame and of evil smell? how shall ye vaunt\nBefore the gods drink-offering or the fat\nOf victims, if I sail among your crew?\nFor this, as ye professed, was the chief cause\nWhy ye disowned me. Perish!—So ye shall,\nFor the wrong done me, if the Heavens be just.\nAnd that they are, I know. Else had ye ne’er\nSailed on this errand for an outcast wretch,\nHad they not pricked your heart with thoughts of me.\nOh, if ye pity me, chastising powers,\nAnd thou, the Genius of my land, revenge,\nRevenge this crime on all their heads at once!\nMy life is pitiable; but if I saw\nTheir ruin, I would think me well and strong.\nCH. How full of bitterness is his resolve,\nWrathfully spoken with unbending will!\nOD. I might speak long in answer, did the time\nGive scope, but now one thing is mine to say.\nI am known to vary with the varying need;\nAnd when ’tis tried, who can be just and good,\nMy peer will not be found for piety.\nBut though on all occasions covetous\n[page 247][1053-1092]Of victory, this once I yield to thee,\nAnd willingly. Unhand him there. Let go!\nLeave him to stay. What further use of thee,\nWhen we have ta’en these arms? Have we not Teucer,\nSkilled in this mystery? Yea, I may boast\nMyself thine equal both in strength and aim\nTo wield them. Fare thee well, then! Thou art free\nTo roam thy barren isle. We need thee not.\nLet us be going! And perchance thy gift\nMay bring thy destined glory to my brow.\nPHI. What shall I do? Alas, shalt thou be seen\nGraced with mine arms amongst Achaean men?\nOD. No more! I am going.\nPHI. O Achilles’ child!\nWilt thou, too, vanish? Must I lose thy voice?\nOD. Come on, and look not, noble though thou be,\nLest thou undo our fortune.\nPHI. Mariners,\nMust ye, too, leave me thus disconsolate?\nWill ye not pity me?\nCH. Our captain’s here.\nWhate’er he saith to thee, that we too speak.\nNEO. My chief will call me weakling, soft of heart;\nBut go not yet, since our friend bids you stay.\nTill we have prayed, and all be ready on board.\nMeanwhile, perchance, he may conceive some thought\nThat favours our design. We two will start;\nAnd ye, be swift to speed forth at our call.[Exit\nMONODY.\nPHI. O cavern of the hollow rock,I 1\nFrosty and stifling in the seasons’ change!\nHow I seem fated never more to range\nFrom thy sad covert, that hath felt the shock\nOf pain on pain, steeped with my wretchedness.\nNow thou wilt be my comforter in death!\nGrief haunted harbour, choked with my distress!\nTell me, what hope is mine of daily food,\nWho will be careful for my good?\n[page 248][1093-1132]I fail. Ye cowering creatures of the sky,\nOh, as ye fly,\nSnatch me, borne upward on the blast’s sharp breath!\nCH. 1. Thou child of misery!\nNo mightier power hath this decreed,\nBut thine own will and deed\nHath bound thee thus in grief,\nSince, when kind Heaven had sent relief\nAnd shown the path of wisdom firm and sure,\nThou still hast chosen this evil to endure.\nPHI. O hapless life, sore bruised with pain!I 2\nNo more with living mortal may I dwell,\nBut ever pining in this desert cell\nWith lonely grief, all famished must remain\nAnd perish; for what food is mine to share,\nWhen this strong arm no longer wields my bow,\nWhose fleet shafts flew to smite the birds of air\nI was o’erthrown by words, words dark and blind,\nLow-creeping from a traitorous mind!\nO might I see him, whose unrighteous thought\nThis ruin wrought,\nPlagued for no less a period with like woe!\nCH. 2. Not by our craft thou art caught,\nBut Destiny divine hath wrought\nThe net that holds thee bound.\nAim not at us the sound\nOf thy dread curse with dire disaster fraught.\nOn others let that light! ’Tis our true care\nThou should’st not scorn our love in thy despair.\nPHI. Now, seated by the shoreII 1\nOf heaving ocean hoar,\nHe mocks me, waving high\nThe sole support of my precarious being,\nThe bow which none e’er held but I.\nO treasure of my heart, torn from this hand,\nThat loved thy touch,—if thou canst understand,\nHow sad must be thy look in seeing\nThy master destined now no more,\nLike Heracles of yore,\n[page 249][1133-1168]To wield thee with an archer’s might!\nBut in the grasp of an all-scheming wight,\nO bitter change! thou art plied;\nAnd swaying ever by his side,\nShalt view his life of dark malignity,\nTeeming with guileful shames, like those he wrought on me.\nCH. 3. Nobly to speak for the right\nIs manly and strong;\nBut not with an envious blight\nTo envenom the tongue;\nHe to serve all his friends of the fleet,\nOne obeying a many-voiced word,\nThrough the minist’ring craft of our lord\nHath but done what was meet.\nPHI. Come, legions of the wild,II 2\nOf aspect fierce or mild,\nFowl from the fields of air,\nAnd beasts that roam with bright untroubled gaze,\nNo longer bounding from my lair\nFly mine approach! Now freely without fear\nYe may surround my covert and come near,\nTreading the savage rock-strewn ways.\nThe might I had is no more mine,\nStolen with those arms divine.\nThis fort hath no man to defend.\nCome satisfy your vengeful jaws, and rend\nThese quivering tainted limbs!\nAlready hovering death bedims\nMy fainting sense. Who thus can live on air,\nTasting no gift of earth that breathing mortals share?\nCH. 4. Ah! do not shrink from thy friend,\nIf love thou reverest,\nBut know ’tis for thee to forfend\nThe fate which thou fearest.\nThe lot thou hast here to deplore,\nIs sad evermore to maintain,\n[page 250][1169-1202]And hardship in sickness is sore,\nBut sorest in pain.\nPHI. Kindest of all that e’er beforeIII\nHave trod this shore,\nAgain thou mind’st me of mine ancient woe!\nWhy wilt thou ruin me? What wouldst thou do?\nCH. 5. How mean’st thou?\nPHI. If to Troy, of me abhorred\nThou e’er hast hoped to lead me with thy lord.\nCH. 6. So I judge best.\nPHI. Begone at once, begone!\nCH. 7. Sweet is that word, and swiftly shall be done!\nLet us be gone, each to his place on board.\n[The Chorus make as if they were going\nPHI. Nay, by dear Zeus, to whom all suppliants moan\nLeave me not yet!\nCH. 8. Keep measure in thy word.\nPHI. Stay, by Heaven, stay!\nCH. 9. What wilt thou say?\nPHI. O misery! O cruel power\nThat rul’st this hour!\nI am destroyed. Ah me!\nO poor torn limb, what shall I do with thee\nThrough all my days to be?\nAh, strangers, come, return, return!\nCH. 10. What new command are we to learn\nCrossing thy former mind?\nPHI. Ah! yet be kind.\nReprove not him, whose tongue, with grief distraught,\nObeys not, in dark storms, the helm of thought!\nCH. 11. Come, poor friend, the way we call.\nPHI. Never, learn it once for all!\nNot though he, whom Heaven obeys,\nBlast me with fierce lightning’s blaze!\nPerish Troy, and all your host,\nThat have chosen, to their cost,\nTo despise and cast me forth,\nSince my wound obscured my worth!\nAh, but, strangers, if your sense\n[page 251][1203-1233]Hath o’er-mastered this offence,\nYield but one thing to my prayer!\nCH. 12. What wouldst thou have?\nPHI. Some weapon bare,\nAxe or sword or sharpened dart,\nBring it to content my heart.\nCH. 13. What is thy new intent?\nPHI. To sever point by point\nThis body, joint from joint.\nOn bloody death my mind is bent.\nCH. 14. Wherefore?\nPHI. To see my father’s face.\nCH. 15. Where upon earth?\nPHI. He hath no place\nWhere sun doth shine, but in the halls of night.\nO native country, land of my delight,\nWould I were blest one moment with thy sight!\nWhy did I leave thy sacred dew\nAnd loose my vessels from thy shore,\nTo join the hateful Danaän crew\nAnd lend them succour? Oh, I am no more!\nLEADER OF CH.\nLong since thou hadst seen me nearing yonder ship,\nHad I not spied Odysseus and the son\nOf great Achilles hastening to our side.\nOD. Wilt thou not tell me why thou art hurrying\nThis backward journey with reverted speed?\nNEO. To undo what I have wrongly done to-day.\nOD. Thy words appal me. What is wrongly done?\nNEO. When in obeying thee and all the host—\nOD. Thou didst what deed that misbecame thy life?\nNEO. I conquered with base stratagem and fraud—\nOD. Whom? What new plan is rising in thy mind?\nNEO. Not new. But to the child of Poeas here—\nOD. What wilt thou do? I quake with strange alarm.\nNEO. From whom I took these weapons, back again——\nOD. O Heaven! thou wilt not give them! Mean’st thou this?\n[page 252][1234-1262]NEO. Yea, for I have them through base sinful means.\nOD. I pray thee, speak’st thou thus to anger me?\nNEO. If the truth anger thee, the truth is said.\nOD. Achilles’ son! What word is fallen from thee?\nNEO. Must the same syllables be thrice thrown forth?\nOD. Once was too much. Would they had ne’er been said!\nNEO. Enough. Thou hast heard my purpose clearly told.\nOD. I know what power shall thwart thee in the deed.\nNEO. Whose will shall hinder me?\nOD. The Achaean host\nAnd I among them.\nNEO. Thou’rt sharp-witted, sure!\nBut little wit or wisdom show’st thou here.\nOD. Neither thy words nor thy design is wise.\nNEO. But if ’tis righteous, that is better far.\nOD. How righteous, to release what thou hast ta’en\nBy my device?\nNEO. I sinned a shameful sin,\nAnd I will do mine utmost to retrieve it.\nOD. How? Fear’st thou not the Achaeans in this act?\nNEO. In doing right I fear not them nor thee.\nOD. I call thy power in question.\nNEO. Then I’ll fight,\nNot with Troy’s legions, but with thee.\nOD. Come on!\nLet fortune arbitrate.\nNEO. Thou seest my hand\nFeeling the hilt.\nOD. And me thou soon shalt see\nDoing the like and dallying not!—And yet\nI will not touch thee, but will go and tell\nThe army, that shall wreak this on thy head.[Exit\nNEO. Thou show’st discretion: which if thou preserve,\nThou may’st maintain a path exempt from pain.\nHo! son of Poeas, Philoctetes, come\nAnd leave thy habitation in the rock.\n[page 253][1263-1294]PHI. What noise again is troubling my poor cave?\nWhy do ye summon me? What crave ye, sirs?\nHa! ’tis some knavery. Are ye come to add\nSome monster evil to my mountainous woe?\nNEO. Fear not, but hearken to what now I speak.\nPHI. I needs must fear thee, whose fair words erewhile\nBrought me to bitter fortune.\nNEO. May not men\nRepent and change?\nPHI. Such wast thou in thy talk,\nWhen thou didst rob me of my bow,—so bright\nWithout, so black within.\nNEO. Ah, but not now,\nAssure thee! Only let me hear thy will,\nIs ’t constant to remain here and endure,\nOr to make voyage with us?\nPHI. Stop, speak no more!\nIdle and vain will all thine utterance be.\nNEO. Thou art so resolved?\nPHI. More firmly than I say.\nNEO. I would I might have brought thee to my mind,\nBut since my words are out of tune, I have done.\nPHI. Thou wert best. No word of thine can touch my soul\nOr win me to thy love, who by deceit\nHast reft my life away. And then thou com’st\nTo school me,—of noblest father, basest son!\nPerish, the Atridae first of all, and then\nLaërtes’ child, and thou!\nNEO. Curse me no more,\nBut take this hallowed weapon from my hand.\nPHI. What words are these? Am I again deceived?\nNEO. No, by the holiest name of Zeus on high!\nPHI. O voice of gladness, if thy speech be true!\nNEO. The deed shall prove it. Only reach thy hand,\nAnd be again sole master of thy bow.[ODYSSEUS appears\nOD. But I make protest, in the sight of Heaven,\nFor Atreus’ sons, and all the Achaean host.\n[page 254][1295-1330]PHI. Dear son, whose voice disturbs us? Do I hear\nOdysseus?\nOD. Ay, and thou behold’st him nigh,\nAnd he shall force thee to the Trojan plain,\nHowe’er Achilles’ offspring make or mar.\nPHI. This shaft shall bear thee sorrow for that boast.\nNEO. Let it not fly, by Heaven!\nPHI. Dear child, let go\nMine arm!\nNEO. I will not.[Exit ODYSSEUS\nPHI. Ah! Why hast thou robbed\nMy bow of bringing down mine enemy?\nNEO. This were ignoble both for thee and me.\nPHI. One thing is manifest, the first o’ the host\nLying forerunners of the Achaean band,\nAre brave with words, but cowards with the steel.\nNEO. Well, now the bow is thine. Thou hast no cause\nFor blame or anger any more ’gainst me.\nPHI. None. Thou hast proved thy birthright, dearest boy.\nNot from the loins of Sisyphus thou earnest,\nBut from Achilles, who in life was held\nNoblest of men alive, and now o’ the dead.\nNEO. It gladdens me that thou shouldst speak in praise\nBoth of my sire and me. But hear me tell\nThe boon for which I sue thee.—Mortal men\nMust bear such evils as high Heaven ordains;\nBut those afflicted by self-chosen ills,\nLike thine to-day, receive not from just men\nOr kind indulgence or compassionate thought.\nAnd thou art restive grown, and wilt not hearken,\nBut though one counsel thee with kind’st intent,\nWilt take him for a dark malignant foe.\nYet, calling Zeus to witness for my soul,\nOnce more I will speak. Know this, and mark it well:\nThou bear’st this sickness by a heavenly doom,\nThrough coming near to Chrysa’s sentinel,\nThe lurking snake, that guards the sky-roofed fold.\nAnd from this plague thou ne’er shall find reprieve\n[page 255][1330-1368]While the same Sun god rears him from the east\nAnd droops to west again, till thou be come\nOf thine own willing mind to Troia’s plain,\nWhere our physicians, sons of Phoebus’ child,\nShall soothe thee from thy sore, and thou with me\nAnd with this bow shalt take Troy’s citadel.\nHow do I know this? I will tell thee straight\nWe have a Trojan captive, Helenus,\nBoth prince and prophet, who hath clearly told\nThis must be so, yea, and ere harvest time\nThis year, great Troy must fall, else if his words\nBe falsified, who will may slay the seer.\nNow, since thou know’st of this, yield thy consent;\nFor glorious is the gain, being singled forth\nFrom all the Greeks as noblest, first to come\nTo healing hands, and then to win renown\nUnrivalled, vanquishing all tearful Troy.\nPHI. Oh how I hate my life! Why must it keep\nThis breathing form from sinking to the shades?\nHow can I prove a rebel to his mind\nWho thus exhorts me with affectionate heart?\nAnd yet, oh misery! must I give way?\nThen how could I endure the light of heaven?\nWith whom could I exchange a word? Ay me!\nEyes that have seen each act of my sad life,\nHow could ye bear it, to behold the sons\nOf Atreus, my destroyers, comrades now\nAnd friends! Laërtes’ wicked son, my friend!\nAnd less I feel the grief of former wrong\nThan shudder with expectance of fresh harm\nThey yet may work on me. For when the mind\nHath once been mother of an evil brood,\nIt nurses nought but evils. Yea, at thee\nI marvel. Thou should’st ne’er return to Troy,\nNor suffer me to go, when thou remember’st\nWhat insult they have done thee, ravishing\nThy father’s rights from thee. And wilt thou then\nSail to befriend them, pressing me in aid?\nNay, do not, son; but, even as thou hast sworn,\nConvey me home, and thou, in Scyros dwelling,\n[page 256][1369-1402]Leave to their evil doom those evil men.\nSo thou shalt win a twofold gratitude\nFrom me and from my father, and not seem,\nHelping vile men, to be as vile as they.\nNEO. ’Tis fairly spoken. Yet I would that thou\nRelying on my word and on Heaven’s aid,\nWould’st voyage forth from Lemnos with thy friend.\nPHI. Mean’st thou to Troy, and to the hateful sons\nOf Atreus, me, with this distressful limb?\nNEO. Nay, but to those that will relieve the pain\nOf thy torn foot and heal thee of thy plague.\nPHI. Thy words are horrible. What mean’st thou, boy?\nNEO. The act I deem the noblest for us both.\nPHI. Wilt thou speak so? Where is thy fear of Heaven?\nNEO. Why should I fear, when I see certain gain?\nPHI. Gain for the sons of Atreus, or for me?\nNEO. Methinks a friend should give thee friendly counsel.\nPHI. Friendly, to hand me over to my foes?\nNEO. Ah, be not hardened in thy misery!\nPHI. I know thou wilt ruin me by what thou speakest.\nNEO. Not I. The case is dark to thee, I see.\nPHI. I know the Atreidae cast me on this rock.\nNEO. But how, if they should save thee afterward?\nPHI. They ne’er shall make me see Troy with my will.\nNEO. Hard is my fortune, then, if by no sleight\nOf reasoning I can draw thee to my mind.\nFor me, ’twere easiest to end speech, that thou\nMight’st live on as thou livest in hopeless pain.\nPHI. Then leave me to my fate!—But thou hast touched\nMy right hand with thine own, and given consent\nTo bear me to my home. Do this, dear son!\nAnd do not linger to take thought of Troy.\nEnough that name hath echoed in my groans.\nNEO. If thou wilt, let us be going.\nPHI. Nobly hast thou said the word.\n[page 257][1402-1436]NEO. Lean thy steps on mine.\nPHI. As firmly as my foot will strength afford.\nNEO. Ah! but how shall I escape Achaean anger?\nPHI. Do not care!\nNEO. Ah! but should they spoil my country!\nPHI. I to shield thee will be there.\nNEO. How to shield me, how to aid me?\nPHI. With the shafts of Heracles\nI will scare them.\nNEO. Give thy blessing to this isle, and come in peace.\nHERACLES appears from above.\nHERACLES. First, son of Poeas, wait till thou hast heard\nThe voice of Heracles, and weighed his word.\nHim thou beholdest from the Heavenly seat\nCome down, for thee leaving the blest retreat,\nTo tell thee all high Zeus intends, and stay\nThy purpose in the journey of to-day.\nThen hear me, first how after my long toils\nBy strange adventure I have found and won\nImmortal glory, which thine eyes perceive;\nAnd the like lot, I tell thee, shall be thine,\nAfter these pains to rise to glorious fame.\nSailing with this thy comrade to Troy-town,\nFirst thou shalt heal thee from thy grievous sore,\nAnd then, being singled forth from all the host\nAs noblest, thou shalt conquer with that bow\nParis, prime author of these years of harm,\nAnd capture Troy, and bear back to thy hall\nThe choicest guerdon, for thy valour’s meed,\nTo Oeta’s vale and thine own father’s home.\nBut every prize thou tak’st be sure thou bear\nUnto my pyre, in memory of my bow.\nThis word, Achilles’ offspring, is for thee\nNo less. For, as thou could’st not without him,\nSo, without thee, he cannot conquer Troy.\nThen, like twin lions hunting the same hill,\n[page 258][1437-1471]Guard thou him, and he thee! and I will send\nAsclepius Troyward to relieve thy pain.\nFor Ilion now a second time must fall\nBefore the Herculean bow. But, take good heed,\nMidst all your spoil to hold the gods in awe.\nFor our great Father counteth piety\nFar above all. This follows men in death,\nAnd fails them not when they resign their breath.\nPHI. Thou whom I have longed to see,\nThy dear voice is law to me.\nNEO. I obey with gladdened heart.\nHER. Lose no time: at once depart!\nBright occasion and fair wind\nUrge your vessel from behind.\nPHI. Come, let me bless the region ere I go.\nPoor house, sad comrade of my watch, farewell!\nYe nymphs of meadows where soft waters flow\nThou ocean headland, pealing thy deep knell,\nWhere oft within my cavern as I lay\nMy hair was moist with dashing south-wind’s spray,\nAnd ofttimes came from Hermes’ foreland high\nSad replication of my storm-vext cry;\nYe fountains and thou Lycian water sweet,—\nI never thought to leave you, yet my feet\nAre turning from your paths,—we part for aye.\nFarewell! and waft me kindly on my way,\nO Lemnian earth enclosed by circling seas,\nTo sail, where mighty Fate my course decrees,\nAnd friendly voices point me, and the will\nOf that heroic power, who doth this act fulfil.\nCH. Come now all in one strong band;\nThen, ere loosing from the land,\nPray we to the nymphs of sea\nKind protectresses to be,\nTill we touch the Trojan strand.",

    "content":"WOMEN OF TRACHIS\nTHE PERSONS\nDÊANIRA, wife of Heracles.\nAn Attendant.\nHYLLUS, son of Heracles and Dêanira.\nCHORUS of Trachinian Maidens.\nA Messenger.\nLICHAS, the Herald.\nA Nurse.\nAn Old Man.\nHERACLES.\nIOLE, who does not speak.\nSCENE. Before the temporary abode of Heracles in Trachis.\n[page 176]This tragedy is named from the Chorus. From the subject it might have been called ‘Deanira or the Death of Heracles’.\nThe Centaur Nessus, in dying by the arrow of Heracles, which had been dipped in the venom of the Hydra, persuaded the bride Deanira, whose beauty was the cause of his death, to keep some of the blood from the wound as a love-charm for her husband. Many years afterwards, when Heracles was returning from his last exploit of sacking Oechalia, in Euboea, he sent before him, by his herald Lichas, Iole, the king’s daughter, whom he had espoused. Deanira, when she had discovered this, commissioned Lichas when he returned to present his master with a robe, which she had anointed with the charm,—hoping by this means to regain her lord’s affection. But the poison of the Hydra did its work, and Heracles died in agony, Deanira having already killed herself on ascertaining what she had done. The action takes place in Trachis, near the Mahae Gulf, where Heracles and Deanira, by permission of Ceyx, the king of the country, have been living in exile. At the close of the drama, Heracles, while yet alive, is carried towards his pyre on Mount Oeta.\n[page 177]\nTHE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS\nDÊANIRA. Men say,—’twas old experience gave the word,\n—‘No lot of mortal, ere he die, can once\nBe known for good or evil.’ But I know,\nBefore I come to the dark dwelling-place,\nMine is a lot, adverse and hard and sore.\nWho yet at Pleuron, in my father’s home,\nOf all Aetolian women had most cause\nTo fear my bridal. For a river-god,\nSwift Achelôüs, was my suitor there\nAnd sought me from my father in three forms;\nNow in his own bull-likeness, now a serpent\nOf coiling sheen, and now with manlike build\nBut bovine front, while from the shadowy beard\nSprang fountain-waters in perpetual spray.\nLooking for such a husband, I, poor girl!\nStill prayed that Death might find me, ere I knew\nThat nuptial.—Later, to my glad relief,\nZeus’ and Alcmena’s glorious offspring came,\nAnd closed with him in conflict, and released\nMy heart from torment. How the fight was won\nI could not tell. If any were who saw\nUnshaken of dread foreboding, such may speak.\nBut I sate quailing with an anguished fear,\nLest beauty might procure me nought but pain,\nTill He that rules the issue of all strife,\nGave fortunate end—if fortunate! For since,\nAssigned by that day’s conquest, I have known\nThe couch of Heracles, my life is spent\nIn one continual terror for his fate.\nNight brings him, and, ere morning, some fresh toil\nDrives him afar. And I have borne him seed;\nWhich he, like some strange husbandman that farms\n[page 178]A distant field, finds but at sowing time\nAnd once in harvest. Such a weary life\nStill tossed him to and fro,—no sooner home\nBut forth again, serving I know not whom.\nAnd when his glorious head had risen beyond\nThese labours, came the strongest of my fear.\nFor since he quelled the might of Iphitus,\nWe here in Trachis dwell, far from our home,\nDependent on a stranger, but where he\nIs gone, none knoweth. Only this I know,\nHis going pierced my heart with pangs for him,\nAnd now I am all but sure he bears some woe.\nThese fifteen months he hath sent me not one word.\nAnd I have cause for fear. Ere he set forth\nHe left a scroll with me, whose dark intent\nI oft pray Heaven may bring no sorrow down.\nATTENDANT. Queen Dêanira, many a time ere now\nHave I beheld thee with all tearful moan\nBewailing the departure of thy lord.\nBut, if it be permitted that a slave\nShould tender counsel to the free, my voice\nMay venture this:—Of thy strong band of sons\nWhy is not one commissioned to explore\nFor Heracles? and why not Hyllus first,\nWhom most it would beseem to show regard\nFor tidings of his father’s happiness?\nAh! here I see him bounding home, with feet\nApt for employment! If you count me wise,\nHe and my words attend upon your will.\nEnter HYLLUS.\nDÊ. Dear child, dear boy! even from the lowliest head\nWise counsel may come forth. This woman here,\nThough a bond-maiden, hath a free-born tongue.\nHYL. What word is spoken, mother? May I know?\nDÊ. That, with thy father lost to us so long,\n’Tis shame thou dost not learn his dwelling-place.\nHYL. Yea, I have learnt, if one may trust report.\nDÊ. Where art thou told his seat is fixed, my son?\n[page 179]HYL. ’Tis said that through the length of this past year\nHe wrought as bondman to a Lydian girl.\nDÊ. Hath he borne that? Then nothing can be strange!\nHYL. Well, that is over, I am told. He is free.\nDÊ. Where is he rumoured, then, alive or dead?\nHYL. In rich Euboea, besieging, as they tell,\nThe town of Eurytus, or offering siege.\nDÊ. Child, hast thou heard what holy oracles\nHe left with me, touching that very land?\nHYL. What were they, mother, for I never knew?\nDÊ. That either he must end his being there,\nOr, this one feat performed, his following time\nShould grace his life with fair prosperity.\nWilt thou not then, my child, when he is held\nIn such a crisis of uncertain peril,\nRun to his aid?—since we must perish with him,\nOr owe our lasting safety to his life.\nHYL. I will go, mother. Had I heard this voice\nOf prophecy, long since I had been there.\nFear is unwonted for our father’s lot.\nBut now I know, my strength shall all be spent\nTo learn the course of these affairs in full.\nDÊ. Go then, my son. Though late, to learn and do\nWhat wisdom bids, hath certainty of gain.\n[Exit HYLLUS. DÊANIRA withdraws\nCHORUS (entering and turning towards the East).\nBorn of the starry night in her undoing,I 1\nLulled in her bosom at thy parting glow,\nO Sun! I bid thee show,\nWhat journey is Alcmena’s child pursuing?\nWhat region holds him now,\n’Mong winding channels of the deep,\nOr Asian plains, or rugged Western steep?\nDeclare it, thou\nPeerless in vision of thy flashing ray\nThat lightens on the world with each new day.\n[page 180]Sad Dêanira, bride of battle-wooing,I 2 [104-143]\nNe’er lets her tearful eyelids close in rest,\nBut in love-longing breast,\nLike some lorn bird its desolation rueing,\nOf her great husband’s way\nStill mindful, worn with harrowing fear\nLest some new danger for him should be near,\nBy night and day\nPines on her widowed couch of ceaseless thought,\nWith dread of evil destiny distraught:[Enter DÊANIRA.\nFor many as are billows of the SouthII 1\nBlowing unweariedly, or Northern gale,\nOne going and another coming on\nIncessantly, baffling the gazer’s eye,\nSuch Cretan ocean of unending toil\nCradles our Cadmus-born, and swells his fame.\nBut still some power doth his foot recall\nFrom stumbling down to Hades’ darkling hall.\nWherefore, in censure of thy mood, I bringII 2\nGlad, though opposing, counsel. Let not hope\nGrow weary. Never hath a painless life\nBeen cast on mortals by the power supreme\nOf the All-disposer, Cronos’ son. But joy\nAnd sorrow visit in perpetual round\nAll mortals, even as circleth still on high\nThe constellation of the Northern sky.\nWhat lasteth in the world? Not starry night,III\nNor wealth, nor tribulation; but is gone\nAll suddenly, while to another soul\nThe joy or the privation passeth on.\nThese hopes I bid thee also, O my Queen!\nHold fast continually, for who hath seen\nZeus so forgetful of his own?\nHow can his providence forsake his son?\nDÊ. I see you have been told of my distress,\nAnd that hath brought you. But my inward woe,\nBe it evermore unknown to you, as now!\n[page 181][144-179]Such the fair garden of untrammeled ease\nWhere the young life grows safely. No fierce heat,\nNo rain, no wind disturbs it, but unharmed\nIt rises amid airs of peace and joy,\nTill maiden turn to matron, and the night\nInherit her dark share of anxious thought,\nHaunted with fears for husband or for child.\nThen, imaged through her own calamity,\nSome one may guess the burden of my life.\nFull many have been the sorrows I have wept,\nBut one above the rest I tell to-day.\nWhen my great husband parted last from home,\nHe left within the house an ancient scroll\nInscribed with characters of mystic note,\nWhich Heracles had never heretofore,\nIn former labours, cared to let me see,—\nAs bound for bright achievement, not for death.\nBut now, as though his life had end, he told\nWhat marriage-portion I must keep, what shares\nHe left his sons out of their father’s ground:\nAnd set a time, when fifteen moons were spent,\nCounted from his departure, that even then\nOr he must die, or if that date were out\nAnd he had run beyond it, he should live\nThenceforth a painless and untroubled life.\nSuch by Heaven’s fiat was the promised end\nOf Heracles’ long labours, as he said;\nSo once the ancient oak-tree had proclaimed\nIn high Dodona through the sacred Doves.\nOf which prediction on this present hour\nIn destined order of accomplishment\nThe veritable issue doth depend.\nAnd I, dear friends, while taking rest, will oft\nStart from sweet slumbers with a sudden fear,\nScared by the thought, my life may be bereft\nOf the best husband in the world of men.\nCH. Hush! For I see approaching one in haste,\nGarlanded, as if laden with good news.\n[page 182][180-212]\nEnter Messenger.\nMESSENGER. Queen Dêanira, mine shall be the tongue\nTo free thee first from fear. Alcmena’s child\nIs living, be assured, and triumphing,\nAnd bringing to our Gods the fruits of war.\nDÊ. What mean’st thou, aged sir, by what thou sayest?\nMESS. That soon thy husband, envied all around,\nWill come, distinguished with victorious might.\nDÊ. What citizen or stranger told thee this?\nMESS. Your herald Lichas, where the oxen graze\nThe summer meadow, cries this to a crowd.\nI, hearing, flew off hither, that being first\nTo bring thee word thereof, I might be sure\nTo win reward and gratitude from thee.\nDÊ. And how is he not here, if all be well?\nMESS. Crossed by no light impediment, my Queen.\nFor all the Maliac people, gathering round,\nThrong him with question, that he cannot move.\nBut he must still the travail of each soul,\nAnd none will be dismissed unsatisfied.\nSuch willing audience he unwillingly\nHarangues, but soon himself will come in sight.\nDÊ. O Zeus! who rulest Oeta’s virgin wold,\nAt last, though late, thou hast vouchsafed us joy.\nLift up your voices, O my women! ye\nWithin the halls, and ye beyond the gate!\nFor now we reap the gladness of a ray,\nThat dawns unhoped for in this rumour’s sound.\nCHORUS\nWith a shout by the hearth let the palace roof ring\nFrom those that are dreaming of bridal, and ye,\nYoung men, let your voices in harmony sing\nTo the God of the quiver, the Lord of the free!\nAnd the Paean withal from the maiden band\nTo Artemis, huntress of many a land,\nLet it rise o’er the glad roof tree,\n[page 183][213-243]To Phoebus’ own sister, with fire in each hand,\nAnd the Nymphs that her co-mates be!\nMy spirit soars. O sovereign of my soul!\nI will accept the thrilling flute’s control.[They dance\nThe ivy-crownèd thyrsus, see!\nWith Bacchic fire is kindling me,\nAnd turns my emulous tread\nWhere’er the mazy dance may lead.\nEuoî! Euoî!\nO Paean! send us joy.\nSee, dearest Queen, behold!\nBefore thy gaze the event will now unfold.\nDÊ. Think not mine eye hath kept such careless guard,\nDear maids, that I could miss this moving train.\nHerald, I bid thee hail, although so late\nAppearing, if thou bringest health with thee!\nEnter LICHAS, with Captive Women.\nLICHAS. A happy welcome on a happy way,\nAs prosperous our achievement. Meet it is\nGood words should greet bright actions, mistress mine!\nDÊ. Kind friend, first tell me what I first would know—\nShall I receive my Heracles alive?\nLICH. I left him certainly alive and strong:\nBlooming in health, not with disease oppressed.\nDÊ. In Greece, or in some barbarous country? Tell!\nLICH. Euboea’s island hath a promontory,\nWhere to Cenaean Zeus he consecrates\nRich altars and the tribute of the ground.\nDÊ. Moved by an oracle, or from some vow?\nLICH. So vowed he when he conquered with the spear\nThe country of these women whom you see.\nDÊ. And who, by Heaven, are they? Who was their sire?\nTheir case is piteous, or eludes my thought.\n[page 184][244-280]LICH. He took them for the service of the Gods\nAnd his own house, when high Oechalia fell.\nDÊ. Was’t then before that city he was kept\nThose endless ages of uncounted time?\nLICH. Not so. The greater while he was detained\nAmong the Lydians, sold, as he declares,\nTo bondage. Nor be jealous of the word,\nSince Heaven, my Queen, was author of the deed.\nEnthrallèd so to Asian Omphalè,\nHe, as himself avers, fulfilled his year.\nThe felt reproach whereof so chafed his soul,\nHe bound fierce curses on himself and sware\nThat,—children, wife and all,—he yet would bring\nIn captive chains the mover of this harm.\nNor did this perish like an idle word,\nBut, when the stain was off him, straight he drew\nAllied battalions to assault the town\nOf Eurytus, whom, sole of earthly powers,\nHe had noted as the source of his annoy,\nBecause, having received him in his hall\nA guest of ancient days, he burst on him\nWith outrage of loud voice and villanous mind,\nSaying, ‘with his hand upon the unerring bow,\nOechalia’s princes could o’ershoot his skill;\nAnd born to bondage, he must quail beneath\nHis overlord’; lastly, to crown this cry,\nWhen at a banquet he was filled with wine,\nHe flung him out of door. Whereat being wroth,\nWhen Iphitus to the Tirynthian height\nFollowed the track where his brood-mares had strayed,\nHe, while the thought and eye of the man by chance\nWere sundered, threw him from the tower-crowned cliff.\nIn anger for which deed the Olympian King,\nFather of Gods and men, delivered him\nTo be a bond-slave, nor could brook the offence,\nThat of all lives he vanquished, this alone\nShould have been ta’en by guile. For had he wrought\nIn open quittance of outrageous wrong,\nEven Zeus had granted that his cause was just.\nThe braggart hath no favour even in Heaven.\n[page 185][281-316]Whence they, o’erweening with their evil tongue,\nAre now all dwellers in the house of death,\nTheir ancient city a captive;—but these women\nWhom thou beholdest, from their blest estate\nBrought suddenly to taste of piteous woe,\nCome to thy care. This task thy wedded lord\nOrdained, and I, his faithful minister,\nSeek to perform.

How if a princess, offspring of their King?\n[page 186][317-348]LICH. I cannot tell. I did not question far.\nDÊ. Have none of her companions breathed her name?\nLICH. I brought them silently. I did not hear.\nDÊ. Yet speak it to us of thyself, poor maid!\n’Tis sorrow not to know thee who thou art.\nLICH. She’ll ne’er untie her tongue, if she maintain\nAn even tenor, since nor more nor less\nWould she disclose; but, poor unfortunate!\nWith agonizing sobs and tears she mourns\nThis crushing sorrow, from the day she left\nHer wind-swept home. Her case is cruel, sure,—\nAnd claims a privilege from all who feel.\nDÊ. Well, let her go, and pass beneath the roof\nIn peace, as she desires; nor let fresh pain\nFrom me be added to her previous woe.\nShe hath enough already.

What? Tell me thy full meaning clearly forth.\nThat thou hast uttered is all mystery.\nMESS. I heard this herald say, while many thronged\nTo hearken, that this maiden was the cause,\nWhy lofty-towered Oechalia and her lord\nFell before Heracles, whom Love alone\nOf heavenly powers had warmed to this emprise,\nAnd not the Lydian thraldom or the tasks\nOf rigorous Omphalè, nor that wild fate\nOf rock-thrown Iphitus. Now he thrusts aside\nThe Love-god, contradicting his first tale.\nWhen he that was her sire could not be brought\nTo yield the maid for Heracles to hold\nIn love unrecognized, he framed erelong\nA feud about some trifle, and set forth\nIn arms against this damsel’s fatherland\n(Where Eurytus, the herald said, was king)\nAnd slew the chief her father; yea, and sacked\nTheir city. Now returning, as you see,\nHe sends her hither to his halls, no slave,\nNor unregarded, lady,—dream not so!\nSince all his heart is kindled with desire.\nI, O my Queen! thought meet to show thee all\nThe tale I chanced to gather from his mouth,\nWhich many heard as well as I, i’ the midst\nOf Trachis’ market-place, and can confirm\nMy witness. I am pained if my plain speech\nSound harshly, but the honest truth I tell.\nDÊ. Ah me! Where am I? Whither am I fallen?\nWhat hidden woe have I unwarily\nTaken beneath my roof? O misery!\nWas she unknown, as he that brought her sware?\nMESS. Nay, most distinguished both in birth and mien;\nCalled in her day of freedom Iolè,\nEurytus’ daughter,—of whose parentage,\nForsooth as ignorant, he ne’er would speak.\nCH. I curse not all the wicked, but the man\nWhose secret practices deform his life.\n[page 188][385-413]DÊ. Say, maidens, how must I proceed? The words\nNow spoken have bewildered all my mind.\nCH. Go in and question Lichas, who perchance\nWill tell the truth if you but tax him home.\nDÊ. I will; you counsel reasonably.\nMESS. And I,\nShall I bide here till thou com’st forth? Or how?\nDÊ.

So slow in coming, and so quickly flown,\nEre one have time to talk with thee anew!\nLICH. What wouldst thou ask me? I am bent to hear.\nDÊ. And art thou bent on truth in the reply?\nLICH. By Heaven! in all that I have knowledge of.\nDÊ. Then tell me, who is she thou brought’st with thee?\nLICH. An islander. I cannot trace her stock.\nMESS. Look hither, man. Who is’t to whom thou speakest?\nLICH. Why such a question? What is thine intent?\nMESS. Nay, start not, but make answer if thou knowest.\nLICH. To Dêanira, Oeneus’ queenly child,\nHeracles’ wife,—if these mine eyes be true,—\nMy mistress.\nMESS. Ay, that is the very word\nI longed to hear thee speak. Thy mistress, sayest?\nLICH. To whom I am bound.\nMESS. Hold there! What punishment\nWilt thou accept, if thou art found to be\nFaithless to her?\nLICH. I faithless! What dark speech\nHast thou contrived?\nMESS. Not I at all. ’Tis thou\nDost wrap thy thoughts i’ the dark.\n[page 189][414-448]LICH. Well, I will go.\n’Tis folly to have heard thee for so long.\nMESS. You go not till you answer one word more.\nLICH. One, or a thousand! You’ll not stint, I see.\nMESS. Thou knowest the captive maid thou leddest home?\nLICH. I do. But wherefore ask?\nMESS. Did you not say\nThat she, on whom you look with ignorant eye,\nWas Iolè, the daughter of the King,\nCommitted to your charge?\nLICH. Where? Among whom?\nWhat witness of such words will bear thee out?\nMESS. Many and sound. A goodly company\nIn Trachis’ market-place heard thee speak this.\nLICH. Ay.\nI said ’twas rumoured. But I could not give\nMy vague impression for advised report.\nMESS. Impression, quotha! Did you not on oath\nProclaim your captive for your master’s bride?\nLICH. My master’s bride! Dear lady, by the Gods,\nWho is the stranger? for I know him not.\nMESS. One who was present where he heard thee tell,\nHow that whole city was subdued and taken,\nNot for the bondage to the Lydian girl,\nBut through the longing passion for this maid.\nLICH. Dear lady, let the fellow be removed.\nTo prate with madmen is mere foolishness.\nDÊ. Nay, I entreat thee by His name, whose fire\nLightens down Oeta’s topmost glen, be not\nA niggard of the truth. Thou tell’st thy tale\nTo no weak woman, but to one who knows\nMankind are never constant to one joy.\nWhoso would buffet Love, aspires in vain.\nFor Love leads even Immortals at his will,\nAnd me. Then how not others, like to me?\n’Twere madness, sure, in me to blame my lord\nWhen this hath caught him, or the woman there,\nHis innocent accomplice in a thing,\nNo shame to either, and no harm to me.\n[page 190][449-490]It is not so. But if from him thou learnest\nThe lore of falsehood, it were best unlearnt;\nOr if the instruction comes of thine own thought,\nSuch would-be kindness doth not prove thee kind.\nThen tell me all the truth. To one free-born\nThe name of liar is a hateful lot.\nAnd thou canst not be hid. Thy news was heard\nBy many, who will tell me. If thou fearest,\nThou hast no cause—for doubtfulness is pain,\nBut to know all, what harm? His loves ere now\nWere they not manifold? And none hath borne\nReproach or evil word from me. She shall not,\nThough his new passion were as strong as death;\nSince most mine eye hath pitied her, because\nHer beauty was the ruin of her life,\nAnd all unweeting, she her own bright land,\nPoor hapless one! hath ravaged and enslaved.—\nLet that be as it must. But for thy part,\nThough false to others, be still true to me.\nCH. ’Tis fairly said. Comply. Thou ne’er wilt blame\nHer faithfulness, and thou wilt earn our loves.\nLICH. Yea, dear my Queen, now I have seen thee hold\nThy mortal wishes within mortal bound\nSo meekly, I will freely tell thee all.\nIt is as he avers. This maiden’s love,\nPiercing through Heracles, was the sole cause,\nWhy her Oechalia, land of plenteous woe,\nWas made the conquest of his spear. And he—\nFor I dare so far clear him—never bade\nConcealment or denial. But myself,\nFearing the word might wound thy queenly heart,\nSinned, if thou count such tenderness a sin.\nBut now that all is known, for both your sakes,\nHis, and thine own no less, look favouringly\nUpon the woman, and confirm the word\nThou here hast spoken in regard to her:—\nFor he, whose might is in all else supreme,\nIs wholly overmastered by her love.\nDÊ. Yea, so my mind is bent. I will do so.\n[page 191][491-519]I will not, in a bootless strife ’gainst Heaven,\nAugment my misery with self-sought ill.\nCome, go we in, that thou may’st bear from me\nSuch message as is meet, and also carry\nGifts, such as are befitting to return\nFor gifts new-given. Thou ought’st not to depart\nUnladen, having brought so much with thee.[Exeunt\nCHORUS.\nVictorious in her might,I 1\nThe Queen of soft delight\nStill ranges onward with triumphant sway.\nWhat she from Kronos’ son\nAnd strong Poseidon won,\nAnd Pluto, King of Night, I durst not say.\nBut who, to earn this bride,\nCame forth in sinewy pride\nTo strive, or e’er the nuptial might be known\nWith fearless heart I tell\nWhat heroes wrestled well,\nWith showering blows, and dust in clouds upthrown.\nOne was a river bold,I 2\nHorn-crowned, with tramp fourfold,\nBull Achelôüs, Acarnania’s Fear;\nAnd one from Bacchus’ town,\nOwn son of Zeus, came down,\nWith brandished mace, bent bow, and barbèd spear.\nWho then in battle brunt,\nTogether, front to front,\nHurled, eager both to win the beauteous prize;\nAnd Cypris ’mid the fray\nAlone, that dreadful day,\nSate umpire, holding promise in her eyes.\nThen clashed the fist, then clanged the bow;II\nThen horns gave crashing blow for blow,\nWhilst, as they clung,\n[page 192][520-555]The twining hip throw both essay\nAnd hurtling foreheads’ fearful play,\nAnd groans from each were wrung.\nBut the tender fair one far away\nSate watching with an eye of piteous cheer\n(A mother’s heart will heed the thing I say,)\nTill won by him who freed her from her fear.\nSudden she leaves her mother’s gentle side,\nBorne through the waste, our hero’s tender bride.\nEnter DÊANIRA.\nDÊ. Dear friends, while yonder herald in the house\nHolds converse with the captives ere he go,\nI have stol’n forth to you, partly to tell\nThe craft my hand hath compassed, and in part,\nTo crave your pity for my wretchedness.\nFor I have taken to my hearth a maid,—\nAnd yet, methinks, no maiden any more,\nLike some fond shipmaster, taking on board\nA cargo fraught with treason to my heart.\nAnd now we two are closed in one embrace\nBeneath one coverlet. Such generous meed\nFor faith in guarding home this dreary while\nHath the kind Heracles our trusty spouse,\nSent in return! Yet, oft as he hath caught\nThis same distemperature, I know not how\nTo harbour indignation against him.\nBut who that is a woman could endure\nTo dwell with her, both married to one man?\nOne bloom is still advancing, one doth fade.\nThe budding flower is cropped, the full-blown head\nIs left to wither, while love passeth by\nUnheeding. Wherefore I am sore afraid\nHe will be called my husband, but her mate,\nFor she is younger. Yet no prudent wife\nWould take this angerly, as I have said.\nBut, dear ones, I will tell you of a way,\nWhereof I have bethought me, to prevent\nThis heart-break. I had hidden of long time\n[page 193][555-591]In a bronze urn the ancient Centaur’s gift,\nWhich I, when a mere girl, culled from the wound\nOf hairy-breasted Nessus in his death.\nHe o’er Evenus’ rolling depths, for hire,\nFerried wayfarers on his arm, not plying\nOr rowing-boat, or canvas-wingèd bark.\nWho, when with Heracles, a new-made bride,\nI followed by my father’s sending forth,\nShouldering me too, in the mid-stream, annoyed\nWith wanton touch. And I cried out; and he,\nZeus’ son, turned suddenly, and from his bow\nSent a wing’d shaft, that whizzed into his chest\nTo the lungs. Then the weird Thing, with dying voice\nSpake to me:—‘Child of aged Oeneüs,\nSince thou wert my last burden, thou shalt win\nSome profit from mine act, if thou wilt do\nWhat now I bid thee. With a careful hand\nCollect and bear away the clotted gore\nThat clogs my wound, e’en where the monster snake\nHad dyed the arrow with dark tinct of gall;\nAnd thou shalt have this as a charm of soul\nFor Heracles, that never through the eye\nShall he receive another love than thine.’\nWhereof bethinking me, for since his death\nI kept it in a closet locked with care,\nI have applied it to this robe, with such\nAddition as his living voice ordained.—\nThe thing is done. No criminal attempts\nCould e’er be mine. Far be they from my thought,\nAs I abhor the woman who conceives them!\nBut if by any means through gentle spells\nAnd bonds on Heracles’ affection, we\nMay triumph o’er this maiden in his heart,\nMy scheme is perfected. Unless you deem\nMine action wild. If so, I will desist.\nCH. If any ground of confidence approve\nThine act, we cannot check thy counsel here.\nDÊ. My confidence is grounded on belief,\nThough unconfirmed as yet by actual proof.\n[page 194][592-627]CH. Well, do it and try. Assurance cannot come\nTill action bring experience after it.\nDÊ. The truth will soon be known. The man e’en now\nIs coming forth, and quickly will be there.\nScreen ye but well my counsel. Doubtful deeds,\nWrapt close, will not deliver us to shame.\nEnter LICHAS.\nLICH. Daughter of Oeneus, tell me thy commands.\nAlready time rebukes our tardiness.\nDÊ. Even that hath been my care, Lichas, while thou\nWert talking to the stranger-maids within,\nThat thou shouldst take for me this finewoven web,\nA present from these fingers to my lord.\nAnd when thou giv’st it, say that none of men\nMust wear it on his shoulders before him;\nAnd neither light of sun may look upon it,\nNor holy temple-court, nor household flame,\nTill he in open station ’fore the Gods\nDisplay it on a day when bulls are slaughtered.\nSo once I vowed, that should I ever see\nOr hear his safe return, I would enfold\nHis glorious person in this robe, and show\nTo all the Gods in doing sacrifice\nHim a fresh worshipper in fresh array.—\nThe truth hereof he will with ease descry\nBetokened on this treasure-guarding seal.—\nNow go, and be advised, of this in chief,\nTo act within thine office; then of this,\nTo bear thee so, that from his thanks and mine\nMeeting in one, a twofold grace may spring.\nLICH. If this my Hermes-craft be firm and sure,\nThen never will I fail thee, O my Queen!\nBut I will show the casket as it is\nTo whom I bear it, and in faithfulness\nAdd all the words thou sendest in fit place.\nDÊ. Go, then, at once. Thou hast full cognizance\nHow things within the palace are preserved?\nLICH. I know, and will declare. There is no flaw.\n[page 195][628-662]DÊ. Methinks thou knowest too, for thou hast seen,\nMy kind reception of the stranger-maid?\nLICH. I saw, and was amazed with heart-struck joy.\nDÊ.

Now I perceive how fond\nIs eagerness, where actions are obscure.\nCH. Tell, if it may be told, thy cause of fear.\nDÊ. A thing is come to pass, which should I tell,\nWill strike you with strange wonder when you learn.\nFor, O my friends, the stuff wherewith I dressed\nThat robe, a flock of soft and milkwhite wool,\nIs shrivelled out of sight, not gnawn by tooth\nOf any creature here, but, self-consumed,\nFrittered and wasting on the courtyard-stones.\nTo let you know the circumstance at full,\nI will speak on. Of all the Centaur-Thing,\nWhen labouring in his side with the fell point\nO’ the shaft, enjoined me, I had nothing lost,\nBut his vaticination in my heart\nRemained indelible, as though engraved\nWith pen of iron upon brass. ’Twas thus:—\nI was to keep this unguent closely hid\nIn dark recesses, where no heat of fire\nOr warming ray might reach it, till with fresh\nAnointing I addressed it to an end.\nSo I had done. And now this was to do,\nWithin my chamber covertly I spread\nThe ointment with piece of wool, a tuft\nPulled from a home-bred sheep; and, as ye saw,\nI folded up my gift and packed it close\nIn hollow casket from the glaring sun.\nBut, entering in, a fact encounters me\nPast human wit to fathom with surmise.\nFor, as it happened, I had tossed aside\nThe bit of wool I worked with, carelessly,\n[page 197][696-733]Into the open daylight, ’mid the blaze\nOf Helios’ beam. And, as it kindled warm,\nIt fell away to nothing, crumbled small,\nLike dust in severing wood by sawyers strewn.\nSo, on the point of vanishing, it lay.\nBut, from the place where it had lain, brake forth\nA frothy scum in clots of seething foam,\nLike the rich draught in purple vintage poured\nFrom Bacchus’ vine upon the thirsty ground.\nAnd I, unhappy, know not toward what thought\nTo turn me, but I see mine act is dire.\nFor wherefore should the Centaur, for what end,\nShow kindness to the cause for whom he died?\nThat cannot be. But seeking to destroy\nHis slayer, he cajoled me. This I learn\nToo late, by sad experience, for no good.\nAnd, if I err not now, my hapless fate\nIs all alone to be his murderess.\nFor, well I know, the shaft that made the wound\nGave pain to Cheiron, who was more than man;\nAnd wheresoe’er it falls, it ravageth\nAll the wild creatures of the world. And now\nThis gory venom blackly spreading bane\nFrom Nessus’ angry wound, must it not cause\nThe death of Heracles? I think it must.\nYet my resolve is firm, if aught harm him,\nMy death shall follow in the self-same hour.\nShe cannot bear to live in evil fame,\nWho cares to have a nature pure from ill.\nCH. Horrid mischance must needs occasion fear.\nBut Hope is not condemned before the event.\nDÊ. In ill-advised proceeding not even Hope\nRemains to minister a cheerful mind.\nCH. Yet to have erred unwittingly abates\nThe fire of wrath; and thou art in this case.\nDÊ.

On, then, with my tale!\nWhen after sacking Eurytus’ great city\nHe marched in triumph with first-fruits of war,—\nThere is a headland, last of long Euboea,\nSurf-beat Cenaeum,—where to his father Zeus\nHe dedicates high altars and a grove.\nThere first I saw him, gladdened from desire.\nAnd when he now addressed him to the work\nOf various sacrifice, the herald Lichas\nArrived from home, bearing thy fatal gift,\nThe deadly robe: wherewith invested straight,\nAs thou hadst given charge, he sacrificed\nThe firstlings of the spoil, twelve bulls entire,\nEach after each. But the full count he brought\nWas a clear hundred of all kinds of head.\nThen the all-hapless one commenced his prayer\nIn solemn gladness for the bright array.\nBut presently, when from the holy things,\nAnd from the richness of the oak-tree core,\n[page 199][766-802]There issued flame mingled with blood, a sweat\nRose on his flesh, and close to every limb\nClung, like stone-drapery from the craftsman’s hand,\nThe garment, glued unto his side. Then came\nThe tearing pangs within his bones, and then\nThe poison feasted like the venomed tooth\nOf murderous basilisk.—When this began,\nHe shouted on poor Lichas, none to blame\nFor thy sole crime, ‘What guile is here, thou knave?\nWhat was thy fraud in fetching me this robe?’\nHe, all-unknowing, in an evil hour\nDeclared his message, that the gift was thine.\nWhereat the hero, while the shooting spasm\nHad fastened on the lungs, seized him by the foot\nWhere the ankle turns i’ the socket, and, with a thought,\nHurl’d on a surf-vex’d reef that showed i’ the sea:\nAnd rained the grey pulp from the hair, the brain\nBeing scattered with the blood. Then the great throng\nSaddened their festival with piteous wail\nFor one in death and one in agony.\nAnd none had courage to approach my sire,—\nConvulsed upon the ground, then tossed i’ the air\nWith horrid yells and crying, till the cliffs\nEchoed round, the mountain-promontories\nOf Locris, and Euboea’s rugged shore.\nWearied at length with flinging on the earth,\nAnd shrieking oft with lamentable cry,\nCursing the fatal marriage with thyself\nThe all-wretched, and the bond to Oeneus’ house,\nThat prize that was the poisoner of his peace,\nHe lifted a wild glance above the smoke\nThat hung around, and ’midst the crowd of men\nSaw me in tears, and looked on me and said,\n‘O son, come near; fly not from my distress,\nThough thou shouldst be consumèd in my death,\nBut lift and bear me forth; and, if thou mayest,\nSet me where no one of mankind shall see me.\nBut if thy heart withhold thee, yet convey me\nOut of this land as quickly as ye may.\nLet me not die where I am now.’ We then,\n[page 200][803-833]Thus urgently commanded, laid him down\nWithin our bark, and hardly to this shore\nRowed him convulsed and roaring.—Presently,\nHe will appear, alive or lately dead.\nSuch, mother, is the crime thou hast devised\nAnd done against our sire, wherefore let Right\nAnd Vengeance punish thee!—May I pray so?\nI may: for thou absolv’st me by thy deed,\nThou that hast slain the noblest of the Earth,\nThy spouse, whose like thou ne’er wilt see again.[Exit DÊANIRA.\nCH.

Would that a sudden flood\nMight sweep her far and swiftly from mine eye!\nWhy fondle vainly the fair-sounding name\nOf mother, when her acts are all unmotherly?\nLet her begone for me: and may she find\nSuch joy as she hath rendered to my sire![Exit HYLLUS\nCHORUS.\nSee where falls the doom, of oldI 1\nBy the unerring Voice foretold,—\n‘When twelve troublous years have rolled,\nThen shall end your long desire:\nToil on toil no more shall tire\nThe offspring of the Eternal Sire.’\nLo! the destined Hour is come!\nLo! it hath brought its burden home.\nFor when the eyes have looked their last\nHow should sore labour vex again?\nHow, when the powers of will and thought are past,\nShould life be any more enthralled to pain?\nAnd if Nessus’ withering shroud,I 2\nWrought by destiny and craft,\nSteep him in a poisonous cloud.\nSteaming from the venomed shaft,\n[page 201][834-870]\nWhich to Death in hideous lair\nThe many-wreathed Hydra bare,\nHow shall he another day\nFeel the glad warmth of Helios’ ray?—\nEnfolded by the Monster-Thing\nOf Lerna, while the cruel sting\nOf the shagg’d Centaur’s murderous-guileful tongue\nBreaks forth withal to do him painful wrong.\nAnd she, poor innocent, who sawII 1\nCheckless advancing to the gate\nA mighty harm unto her state,—\nThis rash young bridal without fear of law,—\nGave not her will to aught that caused this woe,\nBut since it came through that strange mind’s conceiving,—\nThat ruined her in meeting,—deeply grieving,\nShe mourns with dewy tears in tenderest flow.\nThe approaching hour appeareth great with woe:\nSome guile-born misery doth Fate foreshow.\nThe springs of sorrow are unbound,II 2\nAnd such an agony disclose,\nAs never from the hands of foes\nTo afflict the life of Heracles was found.\nO dark with battle-stains, world-champion spear,\nThat from Oechalia’s highland leddest then\nThis bride that followed swiftly in thy train,\nHow fatally overshadowing was thy fear!\nBut these wild sorrows all too clearly come\nFrom Love’s dread minister, disguised and dumb.\nCH. 1.

Ay, and in dreadful wise, as thou shalt hear.\nWhen all alone she had gone within the gate,\nAnd passing through the court beheld her boy\nSpreading the couch that should receive his sire,\n[page 203][902-946]Ere he returned to meet him,—out of sight\nShe hid herself, and fell at the altar’s foot,\nAnd loudly cried that she was left forlorn;\nAnd, taking in her touch each household thing\nThat formerly she used, poor lady, wept\nO’er all; and then went ranging through the rooms,\nWhere, if there caught her eye the well-loved form\nOf any of her household, she would gaze\nAnd weep aloud, accusing her own fate\nAnd her abandoned lot, childless henceforth!\nWhen this was ended, suddenly I see her\nFly to the hero’s room of genial rest.\nWith unsuspected gaze o’ershadowed near,\nI watched, and saw her casting on the bed\nThe finest sheets of all. When that was done,\nShe leapt upon the couch where they had lain\nAnd sat there in the midst. And the hot flood\nBurst from her eyes before she spake:—‘Farewell,\nMy bridal bed, for never more shalt thou\nGive me the comfort I have known thee give.’\nThen with tight fingers she undid her robe,\nWhere the brooch lay before the breast, and bared\nAll her left arm and side. I, with what speed\nStrength ministered, ran forth to tell her son\nThe act she was preparing. But meanwhile,\nEre we could come again, the fatal blow\nFell, and we saw the wound. And he, her boy,\nSeeing, wept aloud. For now the hapless youth\nKnew that himself had done this in his wrath,\nTold all too late i’ the house, how she had wrought\nMost innocently, from the Centaur’s wit.\nSo now the unhappy one, with passionate words\nAnd cries and wild embracings of the dead,\nGroaned forth that he had slain her with false breath\nOf evil accusation, and was left\nOrphaned of both, his mother and his sire.\nSuch is the state within. What fool is he\nThat counts one day, or two, or more to come?\nTo-morrow is not, till the present day\nIn fair prosperity have passed away.[Exit\n[page 204][947-975]\nCHORUS.\nWhich shall come first in my wail,I 1\nWhich shall be last to prevail,\nIs a doubt that will never be done.\nTrouble at home may be seen,I 2\nTrouble is looked for with teen;\nAnd to have and to look for are one.\nWould some fair windII 1\nBut waft me forth to roam\nFar from the native region of my home,\nEre death me find, oppressed with wild affright\nEven at the sudden sight\nOf him, the valiant son of Zeus most High!\nBefore the house, they tell, he fareth nigh,\nA wonder beyond thought,\nWith torment unapproachable distraught.\nHark! ...II 2\nThe cause then of my cry\nWas coming all too nigh:\n(Doth the clear nightingale lament for nought?)\nSome step of stranger folk is this way brought.\nAs for a friend they love\nHeavy and slow with noiseless feet they move.\nWhich way? which way?

Many hot toils and hard beyond report,\nWith sturdy thews and sinews I have borne,\nBut no such labour hath the Thunderer’s wife\nOr sour Eurystheus ever given, as this,\nWhich Oeneus’ daughter of the treacherous eye\nHath fastened on my back, this amply-woven\nNet of the Furies, that is breaking me.\nFor, glued unto my side, it hath devoured\nMy flesh to the bone, and lodging in the lungs\nIt drains the vital channels, and hath drunk\nThe fresh life-blood, and ruins all my frame,\nFoiled in the tangle of a viewless bond.\nYet me nor War-host, nor Earth’s giant brood,\nNor Centaur’s monstrous violence could subdue,\nNor Hellas, nor the Stranger, nor all lands\nWhere I have gone, cleansing the world from harms.\nBut a soft woman without manhood’s strain\nAlone and weaponless hath conquered me.\nSon, let me know thee mine true-born, nor rate\nThy mother’s claim beyond thy sire’s, but bring\nThyself from out the chambers to my hand\nHer body that hath borne thee, that my heart\nMay be assured, if lesser than my pain\nIt will distress thee to behold her limbs\nWith righteous torment agonized and torn.\nNay, shrink not, son, but pity me, whom all\nMay pity—me, who, like a tender girl,\nAm heard to weep aloud!

O Hellas, how I grieve for thy distress!\nHow thou wilt mourn in losing him we see!\nHYL. My father, since thy silence gives me leave,\nStill hear me patiently, though in thy pain!\nFor my request is just. Lend me thy mind\n[page 209][1117-1149]Less wrathfully distempered than ’tis now;\nElse thou canst never know, where thou art keen\nWith vain resentment and with vain desire\nHER. Speak what thou wilt and cease, for I in pain\nCatch not the sense of thy mysterious talk\nHYL. I come to tell thee of my mother’s case,\nAnd her involuntary unconscious fault.\nHER. Base villain! hast thou breathed thy mother’s name,\nThy father’s murderess, in my hearing too!\nHYL. Her state requires not silence, but full speech.\nHER. Her faults in former time might well be told.\nHYL. So might her fault to day, couldst thou but know.\nHER. Speak, but beware base words disgrace thee not.\nHYL. List! She is dead even now with new-given wound.\nHER. By whom? Thy words flash wonder through my woe.\nHYL. Her own hand slaughtered her, no foreign stroke.\nHER. Wretch! to have reft this office from my hands.\nHYL. Even your rash spirit were softened, if you knew.\nHER. This bodes some knavery. But declare thy thought!\nHYL. She erred with good intent. The whole is said.\nHER. Good, O thou villain, to destroy thy sire!\nHYL. When she perceived that marriage in her home,\nShe erred, supposing to enchain thy love.\nHER. Hath Trachis a magician of such might?\nHYL. Long since the Centaur Nessus moved her mind\nTo work this charm for heightening thy desire.\nHER. O horror, thou art here! I am no more.\nMy day is darkened, boy! Undone, undone!\nI see our plight too plainly. woe is me!\nCome, O my son! —thou hast no more a father,—\nCall to me all the brethren of thy blood,\nAnd poor Alcmena, wedded all in vain\n[page 210][1149-1185]Unto the Highest, that ye may hear me tell\nWith my last breath what prophecies I know.\nHYL. Thy mother is not here, but by the shore\nOf Tiryns hath obtained a dwelling-place;\nAnd of thy sons, some she hath with her there,\nAnd some inhabit Thebè’s citadel.\nBut we who are with thee, sire, if there be aught\nThat may by us be done, will hear, and do.\nHER. Then hearken thou unto this task, and show\nIf worthily thou art reputed mine.\nNow is time to prove thee. My great father\nForewarned me long ago that I should die\nBy none who lived and breathed, but from the will\nOf one now dwelling in the house of death.\nAnd so this Centaur, as the voice Divine\nThen prophesied, in death hath slain me living.\nAnd in agreement with that ancient word\nI now interpret newer oracles\nWhich I wrote down on going within the grove\nOf the hill-roving and earth-couching Selli,—\nDictated to me by the mystic tongue\nInnumerous, of my Father’s sacred tree;\nDeclaring that my ever instant toils\nShould in the time that new hath being and life\nEnd and release me. And I look’d for joy.\nBut the true meaning plainly was my death.—\nNo labour is appointed for the dead.—\nThen, since all argues one event, my son,\nOnce more thou must befriend me, and not wait\nFor my voice goading thee, but of thyself\nSubmit and second my resolve, and know\nFilial obedience for thy noblest rule.\nHYL. I will obey thee, father, though my heart\nSinks heavily in approaching such a theme.\nHER. Before aught else, lay thy right hand in mine.\nHYL. Why so intent on this assurance, sire?\nHER. Give it at once and be not froward, boy.\nHYL. There is my hand: I will gainsay thee nought.\nHER. Swear by the head of him who gave me life.\n[page 211][1186-1221]HYL. Tell me the oath, and I will utter it.\nHER. Swear thou wilt do the thing I bid thee do.\nHYL. I swear, and make Zeus witness of my troth.\nHER. But if you swerve, pray that the curse may come.\nHYL. It will not come for swerving:—but I pray.\nHER. Now, dost thou know on Oeta’s topmost height\nThe crag of Zeus?\nHYL. I know it, and full oft\nHave stood there sacrificing.\nHER. Then even there,\nWith thine own hand uplifting this my body,\nTaking what friends thou wilt, and having lopped\nMuch wood from the deep-rooted oak and rough\nWild olive, lay me on the gathered pile,\nAnd burn all with the touch of pine-wood flame.\nLet not a tear of mourning dim thine eye;\nBut silent, with dry gaze, if thou art mine,\nPerform it. Else my curse awaits thee still\nTo weigh thee down when I am lost in night.\nHYL. How cruel, O my father, is thy tongue!\nHER. ’Tis peremptory. Else, if thou refuse,\nBe called another’s and be no more mine.\nHYL. Alas that thou shouldst challenge me to this,\nTo be thy murderer, guilty of thy blood!\nHER. Not I, in sooth: but healer of my pain,\nAnd sole preserver from a life of woe.\nHYL. How can it heal to burn thee on the pyre?\nHER. If this act frighten thee, perform the rest.\nHYL. Mine arms shall not refuse to carry thee.\nHER. And wilt thou gather the appointed wood?\nHYL. So my hand fire it not. In all but this,\nNot scanting labour, I will do my part.\nHER. Enough. ’Tis well. And having thus much given\nAdd one small kindness to a list so full.\nHYL. How great soe’er it were, it should be done.\nHER. The maid of Eurytus thou knowest, I ween.\nHYL. Of Iolè thou speak’st, or I mistake.\nHER. Of her. This then is all I urge, my son.\n[page 212][1222-1258]When I am dead, if thou wouldst show thy duty,\nThink of thine oath to me, and, on my word,\nMake her thy wife: nor let another man\nTake her, but only thou; since she hath lain\nSo near this heart. Obey me, O my boy!\nAnd be thyself the maker of this bond.\nTo spurn at trifles after great things given,\nWere to confound the meed already won.\nHYL. Oh, anger is not right, when men are ill!\nBut who could bear to see thee in this mind?\nHER. You murmur, as you meant to disobey.\nHYL. How can I do it, when my mother’s death\nAnd thy sad state sprang solely from this girl?\nWho, not possessed with furies, could choose this?\nFar better, father, for me too to die,\nThan to live still with my worst enemy.\nHER. This youth withdraws his reverence in my death.\nBut, if thou yield’st not to thy father’s best,\nThe curse from Heaven shall dog thy footsteps still.\nHYL. Ah! thou wilt tell me that thy pain is come.\nHER. Yea, for thou wak’st the torment that had slept.\nHYL. Ay me! how cross and doubtful is my way!\nHER. Because you will reject your father’s word.\nHYL. Must I be taught impiety from thee?\nHER. It is not impious to content my heart.\nHYL. Then you require this with an absolute will?\nHER. And bid Heaven witness to my strong command.\nHYL. Then I will do it, for the act is thine.\nI will not cast it off. Obeying thee,\nMy sire, the Gods will ne’er reprove my deed.\nHER. Thou endest fairly. Now, then, O my son,\nAdd the performance swiftly, that, before\nSome spasm or furious onset of my pain\nHave seized me, ye may place me on the pyre.\nCome, loiter not, but lift me. Now my end\nIs near, the last cessation of my woe.\nHYL. Since thy command is urgent, O my sire!\nWe tarry not, but bear thee to the pyre.\n[page 213][1259-1278]HER. Stubborn heart, ere yet again\nWakes the fierce rebound of pain,\nWhile the evil holds aloof,\nThou, with bit of diamond proof,\nCurb thy cry, with forcèd will\nSeeming to do gladly still!\nHYL. Lift him, men, and hate not me\nFor the evil deeds ye see,\nSince the Heavens’ relentless sway\nRecks not of the righteous way.\nHe who gave life and doth claim\nFrom his seed a Father’s name\nCan behold this hour of blame.\nThough the future none can tell,\nYet the present is not well:\nSore for him who bears the blow,\nSad for us who feel his woe,\nShameful to the Gods, we trow.\nCH. Maidens from the palace-hall,\nCome ye forth, too, at our call!\nMighty deaths beyond belief,\nMany an unknown form of grief,\nYe have seen to-day; and nought\nBut the power of Zeus hath wrought.",

Sophocles was first, Euripides second with the Cretan Women, Alcmaeon in Psophis, Telephus and Alcestis…. The play is somewhat Satyric in character.'\nALCESTIS\nThe scene represents the ancient Castle of ADMETUS near Pherae in Thessaly. It is the dusk before dawn; APOLLO, radiant in the darkness, looks at the Castle.\nAPOLLO.\nAdmetus' House! 'Twas here I bowed my head\nOf old, and chafed not at the bondman's bread,\nThough born in heaven. Aye, Zeus to death had hurled\nMy son, Asclepios, Healer of the World,\nPiercing with fire his heart; and in mine ire\nI slew his Cyclop churls, who forged the fire.\nWhereat Zeus cast me forth to bear the yoke\nOf service to a mortal. To this folk\nI came, and watched a stranger's herd for pay,\nAnd all his house I have prospered to this day.\nFor innocent was the Lord I chanced upon\nAnd clean as mine own heart, King Pheres' son,\nAdmetus. Him I rescued from the grave,\nBeguiling the Grey Sisters till they gave\nA great oath that Admetus should go free,\nWould he but pay to Them Below in fee\nAnother living soul. Long did he prove\nAll that were his, and all that owed him love,\nBut never a soul he found would yield up life\nAnd leave the sunlight for him, save his wife:\nWho, even now, down the long galleries\nIs borne, death-wounded; for this day it is\nShe needs must pass out of the light and die.\nAnd, seeing the stain of death must not come nigh\nMy radiance, I must leave this house I love.\nBut ha! The Headsman of the Pit, above\nEarth's floor, to ravish her! Aye, long and late\nHe hath watched, and cometh at the fall of fate.\nEnter from the other side THANATOS; a crouching black-haired and winged figure, carrying a drawn sword. He starts in revulsion on seeing APOLLO.\nTHANATOS.\nAha!\nWhy here? What mak'st thou at the gate,\nThou Thing of Light? Wilt overtread\nThe eternal judgment, and abate\nAnd spoil the portions of the dead?\n'Tis not enough for thee to have blocked\nIn other days Admetus' doom\nWith craft of magic wine, which mocked\nThe three grey Sisters of the Tomb;\nBut now once more\nI see thee stand at watch, and shake\nThat arrow-armèd hand to make\nThis woman thine, who swore, who swore,\nTo die now for her husband's sake.\nAPOLLO.\nFear not.\nI bring fair words and seek but what is just.\nTHANATOS (sneering)\nAnd if words help thee not, an arrow must?\nAPOLLO.\n'Tis ever my delight to bear this bow.\nTHANATOS.\nAnd aid this house unjustly? Aye, 'tis so.\nAPOLLO.\nI love this man, and grieve for his dismay.\nTHANATOS.\nAnd now wilt rob me of my second prey!\nAPOLLO.\nI never robbed thee, neither then nor now.\nTHANATOS.\nWhy is Admetus here then, not below?\nAPOLLO.\nHe gave for ransom his own wife, for whom …\nTHANATOS (interrupting).\nI am come; and straight will bear her to the tomb.\nAPOLLO.\nGo, take her.—I can never move thine heart.\nTHANATOS (mocking).\nTo slay the doomed?—Nay; I will do my part.\nAPOLLO.\nNo. To keep death for them that linger late.\nTHANATOS (still mocking).\n'Twould please thee, so?… I owe thee homage great.\nAPOLLO.\nAh, then she may yet … she may yet grow old?\nTHANATOS (with a laugh).\nNo!… I too have my rights, and them I hold.\nAPOLLO.\n'Tis but one life thou gainest either-wise.\nTHANATOS.\nWhen young souls die, the richer is my prize.\nAPOLLO.\nOld, with great riches they will bury her.\nTHANATOS.\nFie on thee, fie! Thou rich-man's lawgiver!\nAPOLLO.\nHow? Is there wit in Death, who seemed so blind?\nTHANATOS.\nThe rich would buy long life for all their kind.\nAPOLLO.\nThou will not grant me, then, this boon? 'Tis so?\nTHANATOS.\nThou knowest me, what I am: I tell thee, no!\nAPOLLO.\nI know gods sicken at thee and men pine.\nTHANATOS.\nBegone! Too many things not meant for thine\nThy greed hath conquered; but not all, not all!\nAPOLLO.\nI swear, for all thy bitter pride, a fall\nAwaits thee. One even now comes conquering\nTowards this house, sent by a southland king\nTo fetch him four wild coursers, of the race\nWhich rend men's bodies in the winds of Thrace.\nThis house shall give him welcome good, and he\nShall wrest this woman from thy worms and thee.\nSo thou shalt give me all, and thereby win\nBut hatred, not the grace that might have been.\n[Exit APOLLO.]\nTHANATOS.\nTalk on, talk on! Thy threats shall win no bride\nFrom me.—This woman, whatsoe'er betide,\nShall lie in Hades' house. Even at the word\nI go to lay upon her hair my sword.\nFor all whose head this grey sword visiteth\nTo death are hallowed and the Lords of death.\n[THANATOS goes into the house. Presently, as the day grows lighter, the CHORUS enters: it consists of Citizens of Pherae, who speak severally.]\nCHORUS.\nLEADER.\nQuiet, quiet, above, beneath!\nSECOND ELDER.\nThe house of Admetus holds its breath.\nTHIRD ELDER.\nAnd never a King's friend near,\nTo tell us either of tears to shed\nFor Pelias' daughter, crowned and dead;\nOr joy, that her eyes are clear.\nBravest, truest of wives is she\nThat I have seen or the world shall see.\nDIVERS CITIZENS, conversing.\n(The dash — indicates a new speaker.)\n—Hear ye no sob, or noise of hands\nBeating the breast? No mourners' cries\nFor one they cannot save?\n—Nothing: and at the door there stands\nNo handmaid.—Help, O Paian; rise,\nO star beyond the wave!\n—Dead, and this quiet? No, it cannot be.\n—Dead, dead!—Not gone to burial secretly!\n—Why? I still fear: what makes your speech so brave?\n—Admetus cast that dear wife to the grave\nAlone, with none to see?\n—I see no bowl of clear spring water.\nIt ever stands before the dread\nDoor where a dead man rests.\n—No lock of shorn hair! Every daughter\nOf woman shears it for the dead.\nNo sound of bruisèd breasts!\n—Yet 'tis this very day …—This very day?\n—The Queen should pass and lie beneath the clay.\n—It hurts my life, my heart!—All honest hearts\nMust sorrow for a brightness that departs,\nA good life worn away.\nLEADER.\nTo wander o'er leagues of land,\nTo search over wastes of sea,\nWhere the Prophets of Lycia stand,\nOr where Ammon's daughters three\nMake runes in the rainless sand,\nFor magic to make her free—\nAh, vain! for the end is here;\nSudden it comes and sheer.\nWhat lamb on the altar-strand\nStricken shall comfort me?\nSECOND ELDER.\nOnly, only one, I know:\nApollo's son was he,\nWho healed men long ago.\nWere he but on earth to see,\nShe would rise from the dark below\nAnd the gates of eternity.\nFor men whom the Gods had slain\nHe pitied and raised again;\nTill God's fire laid him low,\nAnd now, what help have we?\nOTHERS.\nAll's done that can be. Every vow\nFull paid; and every altar's brow\nFull crowned with spice of sacrifice.\nNo help remains nor respite now.\nEnter from the Castle a HANDMAID, almost in tears.\nLEADER.\nBut see, a handmaid cometh, and the tear\nWet on her cheek! What tiding shall we hear?…\nThy grief is natural, daughter, if some ill\nHath fallen to-day. Say, is she living still\nOr dead, your mistress? Speak, if speak you may.\nMAID.\nAlive. No, dead…. Oh, read it either way.\nLEADER.\nNay, daughter, can the same soul live and die?\nMAID.\nHer life is broken; death is in her eye.\nLEADER.\nPoor King, to think what she was, and what thou!\nMAID.\nHe never knew her worth…. He will know it now.\nLEADER.\nThere is no hope, methinks, to save her still?\nMAID.\nThe hour is come, and breaks all human will.\nLEADER.\nShe hath such tendance as the dying crave?\nMAID.\nFor sure: and rich robes ready for her grave.\nLEADER.\n'Fore God, she dies high-hearted, aye, and far\nIn honour raised above all wives that are!\nMAID.\nFar above all! How other? What must she,\nWho seeketh to surpass this woman, be?\nOr how could any wife more shining make\nHer lord's love, than by dying for his sake?\nBut thus much all the city knows. 'Tis here,\nIn her own rooms, the tale will touch thine ear\nWith strangeness. When she knew the day was come,\nShe rose and washed her body, white as foam,\nWith running water; then the cedarn press\nShe opened, and took forth her funeral dress\nAnd rich adornment. So she stood arrayed\nBefore the Hearth-Fire of her home, and prayed:\n'Mother, since I must vanish from the day,\nThis last, last time I kneel to thee and pray;\nBe mother to my two children! Find some dear\nHelpmate for him, some gentle lord for her.\nAnd let not them, like me, before their hour\nDie; let them live in happiness, in our\nOld home, till life be full and age content.'\nTo every household altar then she went\nAnd made for each his garland of the green\nBoughs of the wind-blown myrtle, and was seen\nPraying, without a sob, without a tear.\nShe knew the dread thing coming, but her clear\nCheek never changed: till suddenly she fled\nBack to her own chamber and bridal bed:\nThen came the tears and she spoke all her thought.\n'O bed, whereon my laughing girlhood's knot\nWas severed by this man, for whom I die,\nFarewell! 'Tis thou … I speak not bitterly….\n'Tis thou hast slain me. All alone I go\nLest I be false to him or thee. And lo,\nSome woman shall lie here instead of me—\nHappier perhaps; more true she cannot be.'\nShe kissed the pillow as she knelt, and wet\nWith flooding tears was that fair coverlet.\nAt last she had had her fill of weeping; then\nShe tore herself away, and rose again,\nWalking with downcast eyes; yet turned before\nShe had left the room, and cast her down once more\nKneeling beside the bed. Then to her side\nThe children came, and clung to her and cried,\nAnd her arms hugged them, and a long good-bye\nShe gave to each, like one who goes to die.\nThe whole house then was weeping, every slave\nIn sorrow for his mistress. And she gave\nHer hand to all; aye, none so base was there\nShe gave him not good words and he to her.\nSo on Admetus falls from either side\nSorrow. 'Twere bitter grief to him to have died\nHimself; and being escaped, how sore a woe\nHe hath earned instead—Ah, some day he shall know!\nLEADER.\nSurely Admetus suffers, even to-day,\nFor this true-hearted love he hath cast away?\nMAID.\nHe weeps; begs her not leave him desolate,\nAnd holds her to his heart—too late, too late!\nShe is sinking now, and there, beneath his eye\nFading, the poor cold hand falls languidly,\nAnd faint is all her breath. Yet still she fain\nWould look once on the sunlight—once again\nAnd never more. I will go in and tell\nThy presence. Few there be, will serve so well\nMy master and stand by him to the end.\nBut thou hast been from olden days our friend.\n[The MAID goes in.]\nCHORUS.\nTHIRD ELDER.\nO Zeus,\nWhat escape and where\nFrom the evil thing?\nHow break the snare\nThat is round our King?\nSECOND ELDER.\nAh list!\nOne cometh?… No.\nLet us no more wait;\nMake dark our raiment\nAnd shear this hair.\nLEADER.\nAye, friends!\n'Tis so, even so.\nYet the gods are great\nAnd may send allayment.\nTo prayer, to prayer!\nALL (praying).\nO Paian wise!\nSome healing of this home devise, devise!\nFind, find…. Oh, long ago when we were blind\nThine eyes saw mercy … find some healing breath!\nAgain, O Paian, break the chains that bind;\nStay the red hand of Death!\nLEADER.\nAlas!\nWhat shame, what dread,\nThou Pheres' son,\nShalt be harvested\nWhen thy wife is gone!\nSECOND ELDER.\nAh me;\nFor a deed less drear\nThan this thou ruest\nMen have died for sorrow;\nAye, hearts have bled.\nTHIRD ELDER.\n'Tis she;\nNot as men say dear,\nBut the dearest, truest,\nShall lie ere morrow\nBefore thee dead!\nALL.\nBut lo! Once more!\nShe and her husband moving to the door!\nCry, cry! And thou, O land of Pherae, hearken!\nThe bravest of women sinketh, perisheth,\nUnder the green earth, down where the shadows darken,\nDown to the House of Death!\n[During the last words ADMETUS and ALCESTIS have entered. ALCESTIS is supported by her Handmaids and followed by her two children.]\nLEADER.\nAnd who hath said that Love shall bring\nMore joy to man than fear and strife?\nI knew his perils from of old,\nI know them now, when I behold\nThe bitter faring of my King,\nWhose love is taken, and his life\nLeft evermore an empty thing.\nALCESTIS.\nO Sun, O light of the day that falls!\nO running cloud that races along the sky!\nADMETUS.\nThey look on thee and me, a stricken twain,\nWho have wrought no sin that God should have thee slain.\nALCESTIS.\nDear Earth, and House of sheltering walls,\nAnd wedded homes of the land where my fathers lie!\nADMETUS.\nFail not, my hapless one. Be strong, and pray\nThe o'er-mastering Gods to hate us not alway.\nALCESTIS (faintly, her mind wandering).\nA boat two-oared, upon water; I see, I see.\nAnd the Ferryman of the Dead,\nHis hand that hangs on the pole, his voice that cries;\n'Thou lingerest; come. Come quickly, we wait for thee.'\nHe is angry that I am slow; he shakes his head.\nADMETUS.\nAlas, a bitter boat-faring for me,\nMy bride ill-starred.—Oh, this is misery!\nALCESTIS (as before).\nDrawing, drawing! 'Tis some one that draweth me …\nTo the Palaces of the Dead.\nSo dark. The wings, the eyebrows and ah, the eyes!…\nGo back! God's mercy! What seekest thou? Let me be!…\n(Recovering) Where am I? Ah, and what paths are these I tread?\nADMETUS.\nGrievous for all who love thee, but for me\nAnd my two babes most hard, most solitary.\nALCESTIS.\nHold me not; let me lie.—\nI am too weak to stand; and Death is near,\nAnd a slow darkness stealing on my sight.\nMy little ones, good-bye.\nSoon, soon, and mother will be no more here….\nGood-bye, two happy children in the light.\nADMETUS.\nOh, word of pain, oh, sharper ache\nThan any death of mine had brought!\nFor the Gods' sake, desert me not,\nFor thine own desolate children's sake.\nNay, up! Be brave. For if they rend\nThee from me, I can draw no breath;\nIn thy hand are my life and death,\nThine, my belovèd and my friend!\nALCESTIS.\nAdmetus, seeing what way my fortunes lie,\nI fain would speak with thee before I die.\nI have set thee before all things; yea, mine own\nLife beside thine was naught. For this alone\nI die…. Dear Lord, I never need have died.\nI might have lived to wed some prince of pride,\nDwell in a king's house…. Nay, how could I, torn\nFrom thee, live on, I and my babes forlorn?\nI have given to thee my youth—not more nor less,\nBut all—though I was full of happiness.\nThy father and mother both—'tis strange to tell—\nHad failed thee, though for them the deed was well,\nThe years were ripe, to die and save their son,\nThe one child of the house: for hope was none,\nIf thou shouldst pass away, of other heirs.\nSo thou and I had lived through the long years,\nBoth. Thou hadst not lain sobbing here alone\nFor a dead wife and orphan babes…. 'Tis done\nNow, and some God hath wrought out all his will.\nHowbeit I now will ask thee to fulfill\nOne great return-gift—not so great withal\nAs I have given, for life is more than all;\nBut just and due, as thine own heart will tell.\nFor thou hast loved our little ones as well\nAs I have…. Keep them to be masters here\nIn my old house; and bring no stepmother\nUpon them. She might hate them. She might be\nSome baser woman, not a queen like me,\nAnd strike them with her hand. For mercy, spare\nOur little ones that wrong. It is my prayer….\nThey come into a house: they are all strife\nAnd hate to any child of the dead wife….\nBetter a serpent than a stepmother!\nA boy is safe. He has his father there\nTo guard him. But a little girl! (Taking the LITTLE GIRL\nto her) What good\nAnd gentle care will guide thy maidenhood?\nWhat woman wilt thou find at father's side?\nOne evil word from her, just when the tide\nOf youth is full, would wreck thy hope of love.\nAnd no more mother near, to stand above\nThy marriage-bed, nor comfort thee pain-tossed\nIn travail, when one needs a mother most!\nSeeing I must die…. 'Tis here, across my way,\nNot for the morrow, not for the third day,\nBut now—Death, and to lie with things that were.\nFarewell. God keep you happy.—Husband dear,\nRemember that I failed thee not; and you,\nMy children, that your mother loved you true.\nLEADER.\nTake comfort. Ere thy lord can speak, I swear,\nIf truth is in him, he will grant thy prayer.\nADMETUS.\nHe will, he will! Oh, never fear for me.\nMine hast thou been, and mine shalt ever be,\nLiving and dead, thou only. None in wide\nHellas but thou shalt be Admetus' bride.\nNo race so high, no face so magic-sweet\nShall ever from this purpose turn my feet.\nAnd children … if God grant me joy of these,\n'Tis all I ask; of thee no joy nor ease\nHe gave me. And thy mourning I will bear\nNot one year of my life but every year,\nWhile life shall last…. My mother I will know\nNo more. My father shall be held my foe.\nThey brought the words of love but not the deed,\nWhile thou hast given thine all, and in my need\nSaved me. What can I do but weep alone,\nAlone alway, when such a wife is gone?…\nAn end shall be of revel, and an end\nOf crowns and song and mirth of friend with friend,\nWherewith my house was glad. I ne'er again\nWill touch the lute nor ease my heart from pain\nWith pipes of Afric. All the joys I knew,\nAnd joys were many, thou hast broken in two.\nOh, I will find some artist wondrous wise\nShall mould for me thy shape, thine hair, thine eyes,\nAnd lay it in thy bed; and I will lie\nClose, and reach out mine arms to thee, and cry\nThy name into the night, and wait and hear\nMy own heart breathe: 'Thy love, thy love is near.'\nA cold delight; yet it might ease the sum\nOf sorrow…. And good dreams of thee will come\nLike balm. 'Tis sweet, even in a dream, to gaze\nOn a dear face, the moment that it stays.\nO God, if Orpheus' voice were mine, to sing\nTo Death's high Virgin and the Virgin's King,\nTill their hearts failed them, down would I my path\nCleave, and naught stay me, not the Hound of Wrath,\nNot the grey oarsman of the ghostly tide,\nTill back to sunlight I had borne my bride.\nBut now, wife, wait for me till I shall come\nWhere thou art, and prepare our second home.\nThese ministers in that same cedar sweet\nWhere thou art laid will lay me, feet to feet,\nAnd head to head, oh, not in death from thee\nDivided, who alone art true to me!\nLEADER.\nThis life-long sorrow thou hast sworn, I too,\nThy friend, will bear with thee. It is her due.\nALCESTIS.\nChildren, ye heard his promise? He will wed\nNo other woman nor forget the dead.\nADMETUS.\nAgain I promise. So it shall be done.\nALCESTIS (giving the children into his arms one after the other).\nOn that oath take my daughter: and my son.\nADMETUS.\nDear hand that gives, I accept both gift and vow.\nALCESTIS.\nThou, in my place, must be their mother now.\nADMETUS.\nElse were they motherless—I needs must try.\nALCESTIS.\nMy babes, I ought to live, and lo, I die.\nADMETUS.\nAnd how can I, forlorn of thee, live on?\nALCESTIS.\nTime healeth; and the dead are dead and gone.\nADMETUS.\nOh, take me with thee to the dark below,\nMe also!\nALCESTIS.\n'Tis enough that one should go.\nADMETUS.\nO Fate, to have cheated me of one so true!\nALCESTIS (her strength failing).\nThere comes a darkness: a great burden, too.\nADMETUS.\nI am lost if thou wilt leave me…. Wife! Mine own!\nALCESTIS.\nI am not thy wife; I am nothing. All is gone.\nADMETUS.\nThy babes! Thou wilt not leave them.—Raise thine eye.\nALCESTIS.\nI am sorry…. But good-bye, children; good-bye.\nADMETUS.\nLook at them! Wake and look at them!\nALCESTIS.\nI must go.\nADMETUS.\nWhat? Dying!\nALCESTIS.\nFarewell, husband! [She dies.]\nADMETUS (with a cry).\nAh!… Woe, woe!\nLEADER.\nAdmetus' Queen is dead!\n[While ADMETUS is weeping silently, and the CHORUS veil their faces, the LITTLE BOY runs up to his dead Mother.]\nLITTLE BOY.\nOh, what has happened? Mummy has gone away,\nAnd left me and will not come back any more!\nFather, I shall be lonely all the day….\nLook! Look! Her eyes … and her arms not like before,\nHow they lie …\nMother! Oh, speak a word!\nAnswer me, answer me, Mother! It is I.\nI am touching your face. It is I, your little bird.\nADMETUS (recovering himself and going to the Child).\nShe hears us not, she sees us not. We lie\nUnder a heavy grief, child, thou and I.\nLITTLE BOY.\nI am so little, Father, and lonely and cold\nHere without Mother. It is too hard…. And you,\nPoor little sister, too.\nOh, Father!\nSuch a little time we had her. She might have stayed\nOn till we all were old….\nEverything is spoiled when Mother is dead.\n[The LITTLE BOY is taken away, with his Sister, sobbing.]\nLEADER.\nMy King, thou needs must gird thee to the worst.\nThou shalt not be the last, nor yet the first,\nTo lose a noble wife. Be brave, and know\nTo die is but a debt that all men owe.\nADMETUS.\nI know. It came not without doubts and fears,\nThis thing. The thought hath poisoned all my years.\nHowbeit, I now will make the burial due\nTo this dead Queen. Be assembled, all of you;\nAnd, after, raise your triumph-song to greet\nThis pitiless Power that yawns beneath our feet.\nMeantime let all in Thessaly who dread\nMy sceptre join in mourning for the dead\nWith temples sorrow-shorn and sable weed.\nYe chariot-lords, ye spurrers of the steed,\nShear close your horses' manes! Let there be found\nThrough all my realm no lute, nor lyre, nor sound\nOf piping, till twelve moons are at an end.\nFor never shall I lose a closer friend,\nNor braver in my need. And worthy is she\nOf honour, who alone hath died for me.\n[The body of ALCESTIS is carried into the house by mourners; ADMETUS follows it.]\nCHORUS.\nDaughter of Pelias, fare thee well,\nMay joy be thine in the Sunless Houses!\nFor thine is a deed which the Dead shall tell\nWhere a King black-browed in the gloom carouses;\nAnd the cold grey hand at the helm and oar\nWhich guideth shadows from shore to shore,\nShall bear this day o'er the Tears that Well,\nA Queen of women, a spouse of spouses.\nMinstrels many shall praise thy name\nWith lyre full-strung and with voices lyreless,\nWhen Mid-Moon riseth, an orbèd flame,\nAnd from dusk to dawning the dance is tireless;\nAnd Carnos cometh to Sparta's call,\nAnd Athens shineth in festival;\nFor thy death is a song, and a fullness of fame,\nTill the heart of the singer is left desireless.\nLEADER.\nWould I could reach thee, oh,\nReach thee and save, my daughter,\nStarward from gulfs of Hell,\nPast gates, past tears that swell,\nWhere the weak oar climbs thro'\nThe night and the water!\nSECOND ELDER.\nBelovèd and lonely one,\nWho feared not dying:\nGone in another's stead\nAlone to the hungry dead:\nLight be the carven stone\nAbove thee lying!\nTHIRD ELDER.\nOh, he who should seek again\nA new bride after thee,\nWere loathed of thy children twain,\nAnd loathed of me.\nLEADER.\nWord to his mother sped,\nPraying to her who bore him;\nWord to his father, old,\nHeavy with years and cold;\n'Quick, ere your son be dead!\nWhat dare ye for him?'\nSECOND ELDER.\nOld, and they dared not; grey,\nAnd they helped him never!\n'Twas she, in her youth and pride,\nRose up for her lord and died.\nOh, love of two hearts that stay\nOne-knit for ever….\nTHIRD ELDER.\n'Tis rare in the world! God send\nSuch bride in my house to be;\nShe should live life to the end,\nNot fail through me.\n[As the song ceases there enters a stranger, walking strongly, but travel-stained, dusty, and tired. His lion-skin and club show him to be HERACLES.]\nHERACLES.\nHo, countrymen! To Pherae am I come\nBy now? And is Admetus in his home?\nLEADER.\nOur King is in his house, Lord Heracles.—\nBut say, what need brings thee in days like these\nTo Thessaly and Pherae's wallèd ring?\nHERACLES.\nA quest I follow for the Argive King.\nLEADER.\nWhat prize doth call thee, and to what far place?\nHERACLES.\nThe horses of one Diomede, in Thrace.\nLEADER.\nBut how…? Thou know'st not? Is he strange to thee?\nHERACLES.\nQuite strange. I ne'er set foot in Bistony.\nLEADER.\nNot without battle shalt thou win those steeds.\nHERACLES.\nSo be it! I cannot fail my master's needs.\nLEADER.\n'Tis slay or die, win or return no more.\nHERACLES.\nWell, I have looked on peril's face before.\nLEADER.\nWhat profit hast thou in such manslaying?\nHERACLES.\nI shall bring back the horses to my King.\nLEADER.\n'Twere none such easy work to bridle them.\nHERACLES.\nNot easy? Have they nostrils breathing flame?\nLEADER.\nThey tear men's flesh; their jaws are swift with blood.\nHERACLES.\nMen's flesh! 'Tis mountain wolves', not horses' food!\nLEADER.\nThou wilt see their mangers clogged with blood, like mire.\nHERACLES.\nAnd he who feeds such beasts, who was his sire?\nLEADER.\nAres, the war-lord of the Golden Targe.\nHERACLES.\nEnough!—This labour fitteth well my large\nFortune, still upward, still against the wind.\nHow often with these kings of Ares' kind\nMust I do battle? First the dark wolf-man,\nLycaon; then 'twas he men called The Swan;\nAnd now this man of steeds!… Well, none shall see\nAlcmena's son turn from his enemy.\nLEADER.\nLo, as we speak, this land's high governor,\nAdmetus, cometh from his castle door.\nEnter ADMETUS from the Castle.\nADMETUS.\nZeus-born of Perseid line, all joy to thee!\nHERACLES.\nJoy to Admetus, Lord of Thessaly!\nADMETUS.\nRight welcome were she!—But thy love I know.\nHERACLES.\nBut why this mourning hair, this garb of woe?\nADMETUS (in a comparatively light tone).\nThere is a burial I must make to-day.\nHERACLES.\nGod keep all evil from thy children!\nADMETUS.\nNay,\nMy children live.\nHERACLES.\nThy father, if 'tis he,\nIs ripe in years.\nADMETUS.\nHe liveth, friend, and she\nWho bore me.\nHERACLES.\nSurely not thy wife? 'Tis not\nAlcestis?\nADMETUS (his composure a little shaken).\nAh; two answers share my thought,\nQuestioned of her.\nHERACLES.\nIs she alive or dead?\nADMETUS.\nShe is, and is not; and my heart hath bled\nLong years for her.\nHERACLES.\nI understand no more.\nThy words are riddles.\nADMETUS.\nHeard'st thou not of yore\nThe doom that she must meet?\nHERACLES.\nI know thy wife\nHas sworn to die for thee.\nADMETUS.\nAnd is it life,\nTo live with such an oath hung o'er her head?\nHERACLES (relieved).\nAh,\nWeep not too soon, friend. Wait till she be dead.\nADMETUS.\nHe dies who is doomed to die; he is dead who dies.\nHERACLES.\nThe two are different things in most men's eyes.\nADMETUS.\nDecide thy way, lord, and let me decide\nThe other way.\nHERACLES.\nWho is it that has died?\nThou weepest.\nADMETUS.\n'Tis a woman. It doth take\nMy memory back to her of whom we spake.\nHERACLES.\nA stranger, or of kin to thee?\nADMETUS.\nNot kin,\nBut much beloved.\nHERACLES.\nHow came she to be in\nThy house to die?\nADMETUS.\nHer father died, and so\nShe came to us, an orphan, long ago.\nHERACLES (as though about to depart).\n'Tis sad.\nI would I had found thee on a happier day.\nADMETUS.\nThy words have some intent: what wouldst thou say?\nHERACLES.\nI must find harbour with some other friend.\nADMETUS.\nMy prince, it may not be! God never send\nSuch evil!\nHERACLES.\n'Tis great turmoil, when a guest\nComes to a mourning house.\nADMETUS.\nCome in and rest.\nLet the dead die!\nHERACLES.\nI cannot, for mere shame,\nFeast beside men whose eyes have tears in them.\nADMETUS.\nThe guest-rooms are apart where thou shalt be.\nHERACLES.\nFriend, let me go. I shall go gratefully.\nADMETUS.\nThou shalt not enter any door but mine.\n(To an Attendant)\nLead in our guest. Unlock the furthest line\nOf guest-chambers; and bid the stewards there\nMake ready a full feast; then close with care\nThe midway doors. 'Tis unmeet, if he hears\nOur turmoil or is burdened with our tears.\n[The Attendant leads HERACLES into the house.]\nLEADER.\nHow, master? When within a thing so sad\nLies, thou wilt house a stranger? Art thou mad?\nADMETUS.\nAnd had I turned the stranger from my door,\nWho sought my shelter, hadst thou praised me more?\nI trow not, if my sorrow were thereby\nNo whit less, only the more friendless I.\nAnd more, when bards tell tales, were it not worse\nMy house should lie beneath the stranger's curse?\nNow he is my sure friend, if e'er I stand\nLonely in Argos, in a thirsty land.\nLEADER.\nThou callest him thy friend; how didst thou dare\nKeep hid from him the burden of thy care?\nADMETUS.\nHe never would have entered, had he known\nMy grief.—Aye, men may mock what I have done,\nAnd call me fool. My house hath never learned\nTo fail its friend, nor seen the stranger spurned.\n[ADMETUS goes into the house]\nCHORUS.\nOh, a House that loves the stranger,\nAnd a House for ever free!\nAnd Apollo, the Song-changer,\nWas a herdsman in thy fee;\nYea, a-piping he was found,\nWhere the upward valleys wound,\nTo the kine from out the manger\nAnd the sheep from off the lea,\nAnd love was upon Othrys at the sound.\nAnd from deep glens unbeholden\nOf the forest to his song\nThere came lynxes streaky-golden,\nThere came lions in a throng,\nTawny-coated, ruddy-eyed,\nTo that piper in his pride;\nAnd shy fawns he would embolden,\nDappled dancers, out along\nThe shadow by the pine-tree's side.\nAnd those magic pipes a-blowing\nHave fulfilled thee in thy reign\nBy thy Lake with honey flowing,\nBy thy sheepfolds and thy grain;\nWhere the Sun turns his steeds\nTo the twilight, all the meads\nOf Molossus know thy sowing\nAnd thy ploughs upon the plain.\nYea, and eastward thou art free\nTo the portals of the sea,\nAnd Pelion, the unharboured, is but minister to thee.\nHe hath opened wide his dwelling\nTo the stranger, though his ruth\nFor the dead was fresh and welling,\nFor the loved one of his youth.\n'Tis the brave heart's cry:\n'I will fail not, though I die!'\nDoth it win, with no man's telling,\nSome high vision of the truth?\nWe may marvel. Yet I trust,\nWhen man seeketh to be just\nAnd to pity them that wander, God will raise him from the dust.\n[As the song ceases the doors are thrown open and ADMETUS comes before them: a great funeral procession is seen moving out.]\nADMETUS.\nMost gentle citizens, our dead is here\nMade ready; and these youths to bear the bier\nUplifted to the grave-mound and the urn.\nNow, seeing she goes forth never to return,\nBid her your last farewell, as mourners may.\n[The procession moves forward, past him.]\nLEADER.\nNay, lord; thy father, walking old and grey;\nAnd followers bearing burial gifts and brave\nGauds, which men call the comfort of the grave.\nEnter PHERES with followers bearing robes and gifts.\nPHERES.\nI come in sorrow for thy sorrow, son.\nA faithful wife indeed thou hast lost, and one\nWho ruled her heart. But, howso hard they be,\nWe needs must bear these griefs.—Some gifts for thee\nAre here…. Yes; take them. Let them go beneath\nThe sod. We both must honour her in death,\nSeeing she hath died, my son, that thou mayst live\nNor I be childless. Aye, she would not give\nMy soul to a sad old age, mourning for thee.\nMethinks she hath made all women's life to be\nA nobler thing, by one great woman's deed.\nThou saviour of my son, thou staff in need\nTo our wrecked age, farewell! May some good life\nBe thine still in the grave.—Oh, 'tis a wife\nLike this man needs; else let him stay unwed!\n[The old man has not noticed ADMETUS'S gathering indignation.]\nADMETUS.\nI called not thee to burial of my dead,\nNor count thy presence here a welcome thing.\nMy wife shall wear no robe that thou canst bring,\nNor needs thy help in aught. There was a day\nWe craved thy love, when I was on my way\nDeathward—thy love, which bade thee stand aside\nAnd watch, grey-bearded, while a young man died!\nAnd now wilt mourn for her? Thy fatherhood!\nThou wast no true begetter of my blood,\nNor she my mother who dares call me child.\nOh, she was barren ever; she beguiled\nThy folly with some bastard of a thrall.\nHere is thy proof! This hour hath shown me all\nThou art; and now I am no more thy son.\n'Fore God, among all cowards can scarce be one\nLike thee. So grey, so near the boundary\nOf mortal life, thou wouldst not, durst not, die\nTo save thy son! Thou hast suffered her to do\nThine office, her, no kin to me nor you,\nYet more than kin! Henceforth she hath all the part\nOf mother, yea, and father in my heart.\nAnd what a glory had been thine that day,\nDying to save thy son—when, either way,\nThy time must needs be brief. Thy life has had\nAbundance of the things that make men glad;\nA crown that came to thee in youth; a son\nTo do thee worship and maintain thy throne—\nNot like a childless king, whose folk and lands\nLie helpless, to be torn by strangers' hands.\nWilt say I failed in duty to thine age;\nFor that thou hast let me die? Not so; most sage,\nMost pious I was, to mother and to thee;\nAnd thus ye have paid me! Well, I counsel ye.\nLose no more time. Get quick another son\nTo foster thy last years, to lay thee on\nThy bier, when dead, and wrap thee in thy pall.\nI will not bury thee. I am, for all\nThe care thou hast shown me, dead. If I have found\nAnother, true to save me at the bound\nOf life and death, that other's child am I,\nThat other's fostering friend, until I die.\nHow falsely do these old men pray for death,\nCursing their weight of years, their weary breath!\nWhen Death comes close, there is not one that dares\nTo die; age is forgot and all its cares.\nLEADER.\nOh, peace! Enough of sorrow in our path\nIs strewn. Thou son, stir not thy father's wrath.\nPHERES.\nMy son, whom seekest thou … some Lydian thrall,\nOr Phrygian, bought with cash?… to affright withal\nBy cursing? I am a Thessalian, free,\nMy father a born chief of Thessaly;\nAnd thou most insolent. Yet think not so\nTo fling thy loud lewd words at me and go.\nI got thee to succeed me in my hall,\nI have fed thee, clad thee. But I have no call\nTo die for thee. Not in our family,\nNot in all Greece, doth law bid fathers die\nTo save their sons. Thy road of life is thine\nNone other's, to rejoice at or repine.\nAll that was owed to thee by us is paid.\nMy throne is thine. My broad lands shall be made\nThine, as I had them from my father…. Say,\nHow have I wronged thee? What have I kept away?\n'Not died for thee?'… I ask not thee to die.\nThou lovest this light: shall I not love it, I?…\n'Tis age on age there, in the dark; and here\nMy sunlit time is short, but dear; but dear.\nThou hast fought hard enough. Thou drawest breath\nEven now, long past thy portioned hour of death,\nBy murdering her … and blamest my faint heart,\nCoward, who hast let a woman play thy part\nAnd die to save her pretty soldier! Aye,\nA good plan, surely! Thou needst never die;\nThou canst find alway somewhere some fond wife\nTo die for thee. But, prithee, make not strife\nWith other friends, who will not save thee so.\nBe silent, loving thine own life, and know\nAll men love theirs!… Taunt others, and thou too\nShalt hear much that is bitter, and is true.\nLEADER.\nToo much of wrath before, too much hath run\nAfter. Old man, cease to revile thy son.\nADMETUS.\nSpeak on. I have spoken…. If my truth of tongue\nGives pain to thee, why didst thou do me wrong?\nPHERES.\nWrong? To have died for thee were far more wrong.\nADMETUS.\nHow can an old life weigh against a young?\nPHERES.\nMan hath but one, not two lives, to his use.\nADMETUS.\nOh, live on; live, and grow more old than Zeus!\nPHERES.\nBecause none wrongs thee, thou must curse thy sire?\nADMETUS.\nI blest him. Is not life his one desire?\nPHERES.\nThis dead, methinks, is lying in thy place.\nADMETUS.\nA proof, old traitor, of thy cowardliness!\nPHERES.\nDied she through me?… That thou wilt hardly say.\nADMETUS (almost breaking down).\nO God!\nMayst thou but feel the need of me some day!\nPHERES.\nGo forward; woo more wives that more may die.\nADMETUS.\nAs thou wouldst not! Thine is the infamy.\nPHERES.\nThis light of heaven is sweet, and sweet again.\nADMETUS.\nThy heart is foul. A thing unmeet for men.\nPHERES.\nThou laugh'st not yet across the old man's tomb.\nADMETUS.\nDishonoured thou shalt die when death shall come.\nPHERES.\nOnce dead, I shall not care what tales are told.\nADMETUS.\nGreat Gods, so lost to honour and so old!\nPHERES.\nShe was not lost to honour: she was blind.\nADMETUS.\nGo! Leave me with my dead…. Out from my mind!\nPHERES.\nI go. Bury the woman thou hast slain….\nHer kinsmen yet may come to thee with plain\nQuestion. Acastus hath small place in good\nMen, if he care not for his sister's blood.\n[PHERES goes off, with his Attendants. ADMETUS calls after him as he goes.]\nADMETUS.\nBegone, begone, thou and thy bitter mate!\nBe old and childless—ye have earned your fate—\nWhile your son lives! For never shall ye be\nFrom henceforth under the same roof with me….\nMust I send heralds and a trumpet's call\nTo abjure thy blood? Fear not, I will send them all….\n[PHERES is now out of sight; ADMETUS drops his defiance and seems like a broken man.]\nBut we—our sorrow is upon us; come\nWith me, and let us bear her to the tomb.\nCHORUS.\nAh me!\nFarewell, unfalteringly brave!\nFarewell, thou generous heart and true!\nMay Pluto give thee welcome due,\nAnd Hermes love thee in the grave.\nWhate'er of blessèd life there be\nFor high souls to the darkness flown,\nBe thine for ever, and a throne\nBeside the crowned Persephonê.\n[The funeral procession has formed and moves slowly out, followed by ADMETUS and the CHORUS. The stage is left empty, till a side door of the Castle opens and there comes out a SERVANT, angry and almost in tears.]\nSERVANT.\nFull many a stranger and from many a land\nHath lodged in this old castle, and my hand\nServed them; but never has there passed this way\nA scurvier ruffian than our guest to-day.\nHe saw my master's grief, but all the more\nIn he must come, and shoulders through the door.\nAnd after, think you he would mannerly\nTake what was set before him? No, not he!\nIf, on this day of trouble, we left out\nSome small thing, he must have it with a shout.\nUp, in both hands, our vat of ivy-wood\nHe raised, and drank the dark grape's burning blood,\nStrong and untempered, till the fire was red\nWithin him; then put myrtle round his head\nAnd roared some noisy song. So had we there\nDiscordant music. He, without a care\nFor all the affliction of Admetus' halls,\nSang on; and, listening, one could hear the thralls\nIn the long gallery weeping for the dead.\nWe let him see no tears. Our master made\nThat order, that the stranger must not know.\nSo here I wait in her own house, and do\nService to some black thief, some man of prey;\nAnd she has gone, has gone for ever away.\nI never followed her, nor lifted high\nMy hand to bless her; never said good-bye….\nI loved her like my mother. So did all\nThe slaves. She never let his anger fall\nToo hard. She saved us alway…. And this wild beast\nComes in our sorrow when we need him least!\n[During the last few lines HERACLES has entered, unperceived by the SERVANT. He has evidently bathed and changed his garments and drunk his fill, and is now revelling, a garland of flowers on his head. He frightens the SERVANT a little from time to time during the following speech.]\nHERACLES.\nFriend, why so solemn and so cranky-eyed?\n'Tis not a henchman's office, to show pride\nTo his betters. He should smile and make good cheer.\nThere comes a guest, thy lord's old comrade, here;\nAnd thou art all knitted eyebrows, scowls and head\nBent, because somebody, forsooth, is dead!\nCome close! I mean to make thee wiser.\n[The SERVANT reluctantly comes close.]\nSo.\nDost comprehend things mortal, how they grow?…\n(To himself) I suppose not. How could he?…\nLook this way!\nDeath is a debt all mortal men must pay;\nAye, there is no man living who can say\nIf life will last him yet a single day.\nOn, to the dark, drives Fortune; and no force\nCan wrest her secret nor put back her course….\nI have told thee now. I have taught thee. After this\nEat, drink, make thyself merry. Count the bliss\nOf the one passing hour thine own; the rest\nIs Fortune's. And give honour chiefliest\nTo our lady Cypris, giver of all joys\nTo man. 'Tis a sweet goddess. Otherwise,\nLet all these questions sleep and just obey\nMy counsel…. Thou believest all I say?\nI hope so…. Let this stupid grieving be;\nRise up above thy troubles, and with me\nDrink in a cloud of blossoms. By my soul,\nI vow the sweet plash-music of the bowl\nWill break thy glumness, loose thee from the frown\nWithin. Let mortal man keep to his own\nMortality, and not expect too much.\nTo all your solemn dogs and other such\nScowlers—I tell thee truth, no more nor less—\nLife is not life, but just unhappiness.\n[He offers the wine-bowl to the SERVANT, who avoids it.]\nSERVANT.\nWe know all this. But now our fortunes be\nNot such as ask for mirth or revelry.\nHERACLES.\nA woman dead, of no one's kin; why grieve\nSo much? Thy master and thy mistress live.\nSERVANT.\nLive? Man, hast thou heard nothing of our woe?\nHERACLES.\nYes, thy lord told me all I need to know.\nSERVANT.\nHe is too kind to his guests, more kind than wise.\nHERACLES.\nMust I go starved because some stranger dies?\nSERVANT.\nSome stranger?—Yes, a stranger verily!\nHERACLES (his manner beginning to change).\nIs this some real grief he hath hid from me?\nSERVANT.\nGo, drink, man! Leave to us our master's woes.\nHERACLES.\nIt sounds not like a stranger. Yet, God knows…\nSERVANT.\nHow should thy revelling hurt, if that were all?\nHERACLES.\nHath mine own friend so wronged me in his hall?\nSERVANT.\nThou camest at an hour when none was free\nTo accept thee. We were mourning. Thou canst see\nOur hair, black robes…\nHERACLES (suddenly, in a voice of thunder).\nWho is it that is dead?\nSERVANT.\nAlcestis, the King's wife.\nHERACLES (overcome).\nWhat hast thou said?\nAlcestis?… And ye feasted me withal!\nSERVANT.\nHe held it shame to turn thee from his hall.\nHERACLES.\nShame! And when such a wondrous wife was gone!\nSERVANT (breaking into tears).\nOh, all is gone, all lost, not she alone!\nHERACLES.\nI knew, I felt it, when I saw his tears,\nAnd face, and shorn hair. But he won mine ears\nWith talk of the strange woman and her rite\nOf burial. So in mine own heart's despite\nI crossed his threshold and sat drinking—he\nAnd I old friends!—in his calamity.\nDrank, and sang songs, and revelled, my head hot\nWith wine and flowers!… And thou to tell me not,\nWhen all the house lay filled with sorrow, thou!\n(A pause; then suddenly)\nWhere lies the tomb?—Where shall I find her now?\nSERVANT (frightened).\nClose by the straight Larissa road. The tall\nWhite marble showeth from the castle wall.\nHERACLES.\nO heart, O hand, great doings have ye done\nOf old: up now, and show them what a son\nTook life that hour, when she of Tiryns' sod,\nElectryon's daughter, mingled with her God!\nI needs must save this woman from the shore\nOf death and set her in her house once more,\nRepaying Admetus' love…. This Death, this black\nAnd wingèd Lord of corpses, I will track\nHome. I shall surely find him by the grave\nA-hungered, lapping the hot blood they gave\nIn sacrifice. An ambush: then, one spring,\nOne grip! These arms shall be a brazen ring,\nWith no escape, no rest, howe'er he whine\nAnd curse his mauled ribs, till the Queen is mine!\nOr if he escape me, if he come not there\nTo seek the blood of offering, I will fare\nDown to the Houses without Light, and bring\nTo Her we name not and her nameless King\nStrong prayers, until they yield to me and send\nAlcestis home, to life and to my friend:\nWho gave me shelter, drove me not away\nIn his great grief, but hid his evil day\nLike a brave man, because he loved me well.\nIs one in all this land more hospitable,\nOne in all Greece? I swear no man shall say\nHe hath cast his love upon a churl away!\n[He goes forth, just as he is, in the direction of the grave. The SERVANT watches a moment and goes back into the hall.]\n[The stage is empty; then ADMETUS and the CHORUS return.]\nADMETUS.\nAlas!\nBitter the homeward way,\nBitter to seek\nA widowed house; ah me,\nWhere should I fly or stay,\nBe dumb or speak?\nWould I could cease to be!\nDespair, despair!\nMy mother bore me under an evil star.\nI envy them that are perished; my heart is there.\nIt dwells in the Sunless Houses, afar, afar.\nI take no joy in looking upon the light;\nNo joy in the feel of the earth beneath my tread.\nThe Slayer hath taken his hostage; the Lord of the Dead\nHoldeth me sworn to taste no more delight.\n[He throws himself on the ground in despair.]\nCHORUS. [Each member of the CHORUS speaks his line severally, as he passes ADMETUS, who is heard sobbing at the end of each line.]\n—Advance, advance;\nTill the house shall give thee cover.\n—Thou hast borne heavy things\nAnd meet for lamentation.\n—Thou hast passed, hast passed,\nThro' the deepest of the River.\n—Yet no help comes\nTo the sad and silent nation.\n—And the face of thy belovèd, it shall meet thee never, never!\nADMETUS.\nYe wrench my wounds asunder. Where\nIs grief like mine, whose wife is dead?\nMy wife, whom would I ne'er had wed,\nNor loved, nor held my house with her….\nBlessed are they who dare to dwell\nUnloved of woman! 'Tis but one\nHeart that they bleed with, and alone\nCan bear their one life's burden well.\nNo young shall wither at their side,\nNo bridal room be swept by death….\nAye, better man should draw his breath\nFor ever without child or bride.\nCHORUS (as before).\n—'Tis Fate, 'tis Fate:\nShe is strong and none shall break her.\n—No end, no end,\nWilt thou lay to lamentations?\n—Endure and be still:\nThy lamenting will not wake her.\n—There be many before thee,\nWho have suffered and had patience.\n—Though the face of Sorrow changeth, yet her hand is on all nations.\nADMETUS.\nThe garb of tears, the mourner's cry:\nThen the long ache when tears are past!…\nOh, why didst hinder me to cast\nThis body to the dust and die\nWith her, the faithful and the brave?\nThen not one lonely soul had fled,\nBut two great lovers, proudly dead,\nThrough the deep waters of the grave.\nLEADER.\nA friend I knew,\nIn whose house died a son,\nWorthy of bitter rue,\nHis only one.\nHis head sank, yet he bare\nStilly his weight of care,\nThough grey was in his hair\nAnd life nigh done.\nADMETUS.\nYe shapes that front me, wall and gate,\nHow shall I enter in and dwell\nAmong ye, with all Fortune's spell\nDischanted? Aye, the change is great.\nThat day I strode with bridal song\nThrough lifted brands of Pelian pine;\nA hand belovèd lay in mine;\nAnd loud behind a revelling throng\nExalted me and her, the dead.\nThey called us young, high-hearted; told\nHow princes were our sires of old,\nAnd how we loved and we must wed….\nFor those high songs, lo, men that moan,\nAnd raiment black where once was white;\nWho guide me homeward in the night,\nOn that waste bed to lie alone.\nSECOND ELDER.\nIt breaks, like strife,\nThy long peace, where no pain\nHad entered; yet is life,\nSweet life, not slain.\nA wife dead; a dear chair\nEmpty: is that so rare?\nMen live without despair\nWhose loves are ta'en.\nADMETUS (erect and facing them).\nBehold, I count my wife's fate happier,\nThough all gainsay me, than mine own. To her\nComes no more pain for ever; she hath rest\nAnd peace from all toil, and her name is blest.\nBut I am one who hath no right to stay\nAlive on earth; one that hath lost his way\nIn fate, and strays in dreams of life long past….\nFriends, I have learned my lesson at the last.\nI have my life. Here stands my house. But now\nHow dare I enter in? Or, entered, how\nGo forth again? Go forth, when none is there\nTo give me a parting word, and I to her?…\nWhere shall I turn for refuge? There within,\nThe desert that remains where she hath been\nWill drive me forth, the bed, the empty seat\nShe sat in; nay, the floor beneath my feet\nUnswept, the children crying at my knee\nFor mother; and the very thralls will be\nIn sobs for the dear mistress that is lost.\nThat is my home! If I go forth, a host\nOf feasts and bridal dances, gatherings gay\nOf women, will be there to fright me away\nTo loneliness. Mine eyes will never bear\nThe sight. They were her friends; they played with her.\nAnd always, always, men who hate my name\nWill murmur: 'This is he who lives in shame\nBecause he dared not die! He gave instead\nThe woman whom he loved, and so is fled\nFrom death. He counts himself a man withal!\nAnd seeing his parents died not at his call\nHe hates them, when himself he dared not die!'\nSuch mocking beside all my pain shall I\nEndure…. What profit was it to live on,\nFriend, with my grief kept and mine honour gone?\nCHORUS.\nI have sojourned in the Muse's land,\nHave wandered with the wandering star,\nSeeking for strength, and in my hand\nHeld all philosophies that are;\nYet nothing could I hear nor see\nStronger than That Which Needs Must Be.\nNo Orphic rune, no Thracian scroll,\nHath magic to avert the morrow;\nNo healing all those medicines brave\nApollo to the Asclepiad gave;\nPale herbs of comfort in the bowl\nOf man's wide sorrow.\nShe hath no temple, she alone,\nNor image where a man may kneel;\nNo blood upon her altar-stone\nCrying shall make her hear nor feel.\nI know thy greatness; come not great\nBeyond my dreams, O Power of Fate!\nAye, Zeus himself shall not unclose\nHis purpose save by thy decerning.\nThe chain of iron, the Scythian sword,\nIt yields and shivers at thy word;\nThy heart is as the rock, and knows\nNo ruth, nor turning.\n[They turn to ADMETUS.]\nHer hand hath caught thee; yea, the keeping\nOf iron fingers grips thee round.\nBe still. Be still. Thy noise of weeping\nShall raise no lost one from the ground.\nNay, even the Sons of God are parted\nAt last from joy, and pine in death….\nOh, dear on earth when all did love her,\nOh, dearer lost beyond recover:\nOf women all the bravest-hearted\nHath pressed thy lips and breathed thy breath.\nLet not the earth that lies upon her\nBe deemed a grave-mound of the dead.\nLet honour, as the Gods have honour,\nBe hers, till men shall bow the head,\nAnd strangers, climbing from the city\nHer slanting path, shall muse and say:\n'This woman died to save her lover,\nAnd liveth blest, the stars above her:\nHail, Holy One, and grant thy pity!'\nSo pass the wondering words away.\nLEADER.\nBut see, it is Alcmena's son once more,\nMy lord King, cometh striding to thy door.\n[Enter HERACLES; his dress is as in the last scene, but shows signs of a struggle. Behind come two Attendants, guiding between them a veiled Woman, who seems like one asleep or unconscious. The Woman remains in the background while HERACLES comes forward.]\nHERACLES.\nThou art my friend, Admetus; therefore bold\nAnd plain I tell my story, and withhold\nNo secret hurt.—Was I not worthy, friend,\nTo stand beside thee; yea, and to the end\nBe proven in sorrow if I was true to thee?\nAnd thou didst tell me not a word, while she\nLay dead within; but bid me feast, as though\nNaught but the draping of some stranger's woe\nWas on thee. So I garlanded my brow\nAnd poured the gods drink-offering, and but now\nFilled thy death-stricken house with wine and song.\nThou hast done me wrong, my brother; a great wrong\nThou hast done me. But I will not add more pain\nIn thine affliction.\nWhy I am here again,\nReturning, thou must hear. I pray thee, take\nAnd keep yon woman for me till I make\nMy homeward way from Thrace, when I have ta'en\nThose four steeds and their bloody master slain.\nAnd if—which heaven avert!—I ne'er should see\nHellas again, I leave her here, to be\nAn handmaid in thy house. No labour small\nWas it that brought her to my hand at all.\nI fell upon a contest certain Kings\nHad set for all mankind, sore buffetings\nAnd meet for strong men, where I staked my life\nAnd won this woman. For the easier strife\nBlack steeds were prizes; herds of kine were cast\nFor heavier issues, fists and wrestling; last,\nThis woman…. Lest my work should all seem done\nFor naught, I needs must keep what I have won;\nSo prithee take her in. No theft, but true\nToil, won her…. Some day thou mayst thank me, too.\nADMETUS.\n'Twas in no scorn, no bitterness to thee,\nI hid my wife's death and my misery.\nMethought it was but added pain on pain\nIf thou shouldst leave me, and roam forth again\nSeeking another's roof. And, for mine own\nSorrow, I was content to weep alone.\nBut, for this damsel, if it may be so,\nI pray thee, Lord, let some man, not in woe\nLike mine, take her. Thou hast in Thessaly\nAbundant friends…. 'Twould wake sad thoughts in me.\nHow could I have this damsel in my sight\nAnd keep mine eyes dry? Prince, why wilt thou smite\nThe smitten? Griefs enough are on my head.\nWhere in my castle could so young a maid\nBe lodged—her veil and raiment show her young:\nHere, in the men's hall? I should fear some wrong.\n'Tis not so easy, Prince, to keep controlled\nMy young men. And thy charge I fain would hold\nSacred.—If not, wouldst have me keep her in\nThe women's chambers … where my dead hath been?\nHow could I lay this woman where my bride\nOnce lay? It were dishonour double-dyed.\nThese streets would curse the man who so betrayed\nThe wife who saved him for some younger maid;\nThe dead herself … I needs must worship her\nAnd keep her will.\n[During the last few lines ADMETUS has been looking at the veiled Woman and, though he does not consciously recognize her, feels a strange emotion overmastering him. He draws back.]\nAye. I must walk with care….\nO woman, whosoe'er thou art, thou hast\nThe shape of my Alcestis; thou art cast\nIn mould like hers…. Oh, take her from mine eyes!\nIn God's name!\n[HERACLES signs to the Attendants to take ALCESTIS away again.\nShe stays veiled and unnoticing in the background.]\nI was fallen, and in this wise\nThou wilt make me deeper fall…. Meseems, meseems,\nThere in her face the loved one of my dreams\nLooked forth.—My heart is made a turbid thing,\nCraving I know not what, and my tears spring\nUnbidden.—Grief I knew 'twould be; but how\nFiery a grief I never knew till now.\nLEADER.\nThy fate I praise not. Yet, what gift soe'er\nGod giveth, man must steel himself and bear.\nHERACLES (drawing ADMETUS on).\nWould God, I had the power, 'mid all this might\nOf arm, to break the dungeons of the night,\nAnd free thy wife, and make thee glad again!\nADMETUS.\nWhere is such power? I know thy heart were fain;\nBut so 'tis writ. The dead shall never rise.\nHERACLES.\nChafe not the curb, then: suffer and be wise.\nADMETUS.\nEasier to give such counsel than to keep.\nHERACLES.\nWho will be happier, shouldst thou always weep?\nADMETUS.\nWhy, none. Yet some blind longing draws me on…\nHERACLES.\n'Tis natural. Thou didst love her that is gone.\nADMETUS.\n'Tis that hath wrecked, oh more than wrecked, my life.\nHERACLES.\n'Tis certain: thou hast lost a faithful wife.\nADMETUS.\nTill life itself is dead and wearies me.\nHERACLES.\nThy pain is yet young. Time will soften thee,\n[The veiled Woman begins dimly, as though in a dream, to hear the words spoken.]\nADMETUS.\nTime? Yes, if time be death.\nHERACLES.\nNay, wait; and some\nWoman, some new desire of love, will come.\nADMETUS (indignantly).\nPeace!\nHow canst thou? Shame upon thee!\nHERACLES.\nThou wilt stay\nUnwed for ever, lonely night and day?\nADMETUS.\nNo other bride in these void arms shall lie.\nHERACLES.\nWhat profit will thy dead wife gain thereby?\nADMETUS.\nHonour; which finds her wheresoe'er she lies.\nHERACLES.\nMost honourable in thee: but scarcely wise!\nADMETUS.\nGod curse me, if I betray her in her tomb!\nHERACLES.\nSo be it!…\nAnd this good damsel, thou wilt take her home?\nADMETUS.\nNo, in the name of Zeus, thy father! No!\nHERACLES.\nI swear, 'tis not well to reject her so.\nADMETUS.\n'Twould tear my heart to accept her.\nHERACLES.\nGrant me, friend,\nThis one boon! It may help thee in the end.\nADMETUS.\nWoe's me!\nWould God thou hadst never won those victories!\nHERACLES.\nThou sharest both the victory and the prize.\nADMETUS.\nThou art generous…. But now let her go.\nHERACLES.\nShe shall,\nIf go she must. Look first, and judge withal.\n[He takes the veil off ALCESTIS.]\nADMETUS (steadily refusing to look).\nShe must.—And thou, forgive me!\nHERACLES.\nFriend, there is\nA secret reason why I pray for this.\nADMETUS (surprised, then reluctantly yielding).\nI grant thy boon then—though it likes me ill.\nHERACLES.\n'Twill like thee later. Now … but do my will.\nADMETUS (beckoning to an Attendant).\nTake her; find her some lodging in my hall.\nHERACLES.\nI will not yield this maid to any thrall.\nADMETUS.\nTake her thyself and lead her in.\nHERACLES.\nI stand\nBeside her; take her; lead her to thy hand.\n[He brings the Woman close to ADMETUS, who looks determinedly away. She reaches out her arms.]\nADMETUS.\nI touch her not.—Let her go in!\nHERACLES.\nI am loth\nTo trust her save to thy pledged hand and oath.\n[He lays his hand on ADMETUS'S shoulder.]\nADMETUS (desperately).\nLord, this is violence … wrong …\nHERACLES.\nReach forth thine hand\nAnd touch this comer from a distant land.\nADMETUS (holding out his hand without looking).\nLike Perseus when he touched the Gorgon, there!\nHERACLES.\nThou hast touched her?\nADMETUS (at last taking her hand).\nTouched her?… Yes.\nHERACLES (a hand on the shoulder of each).\nThen cling to her;\nAnd say if thou hast found a guest of grace\nIn God's son, Heracles! Look in her face;\nLook; is she like…?\n[ADMETUS looks and stands amazed.]\nGo, and forget in bliss\nThy sorrow!\nADMETUS.\nO ye Gods! What meaneth this?\nA marvel beyond dreams! The face … 'tis she;\nMine, verily mine! Or doth God mock at me\nAnd blast my vision with some mad surmise?\nHERACLES.\nNot so. This is thy wife before thine eyes.\nADMETUS (who has recoiled in his amazement).\nBeware! The dead have phantoms that they send…\nHERACLES.\nNay; no ghost-raiser hast thou made thy friend.\nADMETUS.\nMy wife … she whom I buried?\nHERACLES.\nI deceive\nThee not; nor wonder thou canst scarce believe.\nADMETUS.\nAnd dare I touch her, greet her, as mine own\nWife living?\nHERACLES.\nGreet her. Thy desire is won.\nADMETUS (approaching with awe),\nBeloved eyes; beloved form; O thou\nGone beyond hope, I have thee, I hold thee now?\nHERACLES.\nThou hast her: may no god begrudge your joy.\nADMETUS (turning to HERACLES).\nO lordly conqueror, Child of Zeus on high,\nBe blessèd! And may He, thy sire above,\nSave thee, as thou alone hast saved my love!\n[He kneels to HERACLES, who raises him.]\nBut how … how didst thou win her to the light?\nHERACLES.\nI fought for life with Him I needs must fight.\nADMETUS.\nWith Death thou hast fought! But where?\nHERACLES.\nAmong his dead\nI lay, and sprang and gripped him as he fled.\nADMETUS (in an awed whisper, looking towards ALCESTIS).\nWhy standeth she so still? No sound, no word!\nHERACLES.\nShe hath dwelt with Death. Her voice may not be heard\nEre to the Lords of Them Below she pay\nDue cleansing, and awake on the third day.\n(To the Attendants) So; guide her home.\n[They lead ALCESTIS to the doorway.]\nAnd thou, King, for the rest\nOf time, be true; be righteous to thy guest,\nAs he would have thee be. But now farewell!\nMy task yet lies before me, and the spell\nThat binds me to my master; forth I fare.\nADMETUS.\nStay with us this one day!

    "content":"Andromache\nBy Euripides\nWritten 428-24 B.C.E\nTranslated by E. P. Coleridge\nDramatis Personae\nANDROMACHE\nMAID OF ANDROMACHE\nCHORUS OF PHTHIAN WOMEN\nHERMIONE, daughter of MENELAUS and wife of Neoptolemus\nMENELAUS, King of Sparta\nMOLOSSUS, son of ANDROMACHE and Neoptolemus\nPELEUS, father of Achilles\nNURSE OF HERMIONE\nORESTES, son of Agamemnon\nMESSENGER\nTHETIS, the goddess, wife of PELEUS\nScene\nBefore the temple of THETIS in Thessaly. ANDROMACHE, dressed as a suppliant, is clinging to the altar in front of the temple. The palace of Achilles is nearby.\nANDROMACHE\nO city of Thebes, glory of Asia, whence on a day I came to Priam's princely home with many a rich and costly thing in my dower, affianced unto Hector to be the mother of his children, I Andromache, envied name in days of yore, but now of all women that have been or yet shall be the most unfortunate; for I have lived to see my husband Hector slain by Achilles, and the babe Astyanax, whom I bore my lord, hurled from the towering battlements, when the Hellenes sacked our Trojan home; and I myself am come to Hellas as a slave, though I was esteemed a daughter of a race most free, given to Neoptolemus that island-prince, and set apart for him as his special prize from the spoils of Troy. And here I dwell upon the boundaries of Phthia and Pharsalia's town, where Thetis erst, the goddess of the sea, abode with Peleus apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore the folk of Thessaly call it the sacred place of Thetis, in honour of the goddess's marriage. Here dwells the son of Achilles and suffers Peleus still to rule Pharsalia, not wishing to assume the sceptre while the old man lives. Within these halls have borne a boy to the son of Achilles, my master. Now aforetime for all my misery I ever had a hope to lead me on, that, if my child were safe, I might find some help and protection from my woes; but since my lord in scorn of his bondmaid's charms hath wedded that Spartan Hermione, I am tormented by her most cruelly; for she saith that I by secret enchantment am making her barren and distasteful to her husband, and that I design to take her place in this house, ousting her the rightful mistress by force; whereas I at first submitted against my will and now have resigned my place; be almighty Zeus my witness that it was not of my own free will I became her rival!\nBut I cannot convince her, and she longs to kill me, and her father Menelaus is an accomplice in this. E'en now is he within, arrived from Sparta for this very purpose, while I in terror am come to take up position here in the shrine of Thetis adjoining the house, if haply it may save me from death; for Peleus and his descendants hold it in honour as symbol of his marriage with the Nereid. My only son am I secretly conveying to a neighbour's house in fear for his life. For his sire stands not by my side to lend his aid and cannot avail his child at all, being absent in the land of Delphi, where he is offering recompense to Loxias for the madness he committed, when on a day he went to Pytho and demanded of Phoebus satisfaction for his father's death, if haply his prayer might avert those past sins and win for him the god's goodwill hereafter.\nThe MAID OF ANDROMACHE enters.\nMAID\nMistress mine, be sure I do not hesitate to call thee by that name, seeing that I thought it thy right in thine own house also, when we dwelt in Troy-land; as I was ever thy friend and thy husband's while yet he was alive, so now have I come with strange tidings, in terror lest any of our masters learn hereof but still out of pity for thee; for Menelaus and his daughter are forming dire plots against thee, whereof thou must beware.\nANDROMACHE\nAh! kind companion of my bondage, for such thou art to her, who, erst thy queen, is now sunk in misery; what are they doing? What new schemes are they devising in their eagerness to take away my wretched life?\nMAID\nAlas! poor lady, they intend to slay thy son, whom thou hast privily conveyed from out the house.\nANDROMACHE\nAh me! Has she heard that my babe was put out of her reach? Who told her? Woe is me! how utterly undone!\nMAID\nI know not, but thus much of their schemes I heard myself; and Menelaus has left the house to fetch him.\nANDROMACHE\nThen am I lost; ah, my child! those vultures twain will take and slay thee; while he who is called thy father lingers still in Delphi.\nMAID\nTrue, for had he been here thou wouldst not have fared so hardly, am sure; but, as it is, thou art friendless.\nANDROMACHE\nHave no tidings come that Peleus may arrive?\nMAID\nHe is too old to help thee if he came.\nANDROMACHE\nAnd yet I sent for him more than once.\nMAID\nSurely thou dost not suppose that any of thy messengers heed thee?\nANDROMACHE\nWhy should they? Wilt thou then go for me?\nMAID\nHow shall I explain my long absence from the house?\nANDROMACHE\nThou art a woman; thou canst invent a hundred ways.\nMAID\nThere is a risk, for Hermione keeps no careless guard.\nANDROMACHE\nDost look to that? Thou art disowning thy friends in distress.\nMAID\nNot so; never taunt me with that. I will go, for of a truth a woman and a slave is not of much account, e'en if aught befall me.\nThe MAID withdraws.\nANDROMACHE\nGo then, while I will tell to heaven the lengthy tale of lamentation, mourning, and weeping, that has ever been my hard lot; for 'tis woman's way to delight in present misfortunes even to keeping them always on her tongue and lips. But I have many reasons, not merely one for tears,-my city's fall, my Hector's death, the hardness of the lot to which I am bound, since I fell on slavery's evil days undeservedly. 'Tis never right to call a son of man happy, till thou hast seen his end, to judge from the way he passes it how he will descend to that other world.\nShe begins to chant.\n'Twas no bride Paris took with him to the towers of Ilium, but curse to his bed when he brought Helen to her bower. For her sake, Troy, did eager warriors, sailing from Hellas in a thousand ships, capture and make thee a prey to fire and sword; and the son of sea-born Thetis mounted on his chariot dragged my husband Hector round the walls, ah woe is me! while I was hurried from my chamber to the beach, with slavery's hateful pall upon me. And many tear I shed as I left my city, my bridal bower, and my husband in the dust. Woe, woe is me! why should I prolong my life, to serve Hermione? Her cruelty it is that drives me hither to the image of the goddess to throw my suppliant arms about it, melting to tears as doth a spring that gushes from the rock.\nThe CHORUS OF PHTHIAN WOMEN enters.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nLady, thus keeping thy weary station without pause upon the floor of Thetis' shrine, Phthian though I am, to thee a daughter of Asia I come, to see if I can devise some remedy for these perplexing troubles, which have involved thee and Hermione in fell discord, because to thy sorrow thou sharest with her the love of Achilles' son.\nantistrophe 1\nRecognize thy position, weigh the present evil into the which thou art come. Thou art a Trojan captive; thy rival is thy mistress, a true-born daughter of Sparta. Leave then this home of sacrifice, the shrine of our sea-goddess. How can it avail thee to waste thy comeliness and disfigure it by weeping by reason of a mistress's harsh usage? Might will prevail against thee; why vainly toil in thy feebleness?\nstrophe 2\nCome, quit the bright sanctuary of the Nereid divine. Recognize that thou art in bondage on a foreign soil, in a strange city, where thou seest none of all thy friends, luckless lady, cast on evil days.\nantistrophe 2\nYea, I did pity thee most truly, Trojan dame, when thou camest to this house; but from fear of my mistress I hold my peace, albeit I sympathize with thee, lest she, whom Zeus's daughter bore, discover my good will toward thee.\nHERMIONE enters, in complete royal regalia.\nHERMIONE\nWith a crown of golden workmanship upon my head and about my body this embroidered robe am I come hither; no presents these I wear from the palace of Achilles or Peleus, but gifts my father Menelaus gave me together with a sumptuous dower from Sparta in Laconia, to insure me freedom of speech. Such is my answer to you;\nto the CHORUS\nbut as for thee, slave and captive, thou wouldst fain oust me and secure this palace for thyself, and thanks to thy enchantment I am hated by my husband; thou it is that hast made my womb barren and cheated my hopes; for Asia's daughters have clever heads for such villainy; yet will I check thee therefrom, nor shall this temple of the Nereid avail thee aught, no! neither its altar or shrine, but thou shalt die. But if or god or man should haply wish to save thee, thou must atone for thy proud thoughts of happier days now past by humbling thyself and crouching prostrate at my knees, by sweeping out my halls, and by learning, as thou sprinklest water from a golden ewer, where thou now art. Here is no Hector, no Priam with his gold, but a city of Hellas. Yet thou, miserable woman, hast gone so far in wantonness that thou canst lay thee down with the son of the very man that slew thy husband, and bear children to the murderer. Such is all the race of barbarians; father and daughter, mother and son, sister and brother mate together; the nearest and dearest stain their path with each other's blood, and no law restrains such horrors. Bring not these crimes amongst us, for here we count it shame that one man should have the control of two wives, and men are content to turn to one lawful love, that is, all who care to live an honourable life.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nWomen are by nature somewhat jealous, and do ever show the keenest hate to rivals in their love.\nANDROMACHE\nAh! well-a-day! Youth is a bane to mortals, in every case, that is, where a man embraces injustice in his early days. Now I am afraid that my being a slave will prevent thee listening to me in spite of many a just plea, or if I win my case, I fear I may be damaged on this very ground, for the high and mighty cannot brook refuting arguments from their inferiors; still I will not be convicted of betraying my own cause. Tell me, proud young wife, what assurance can make me confident of wresting from thee thy lawful lord? Is it that Laconia's capital yields to Phrygia? is it that my fortune outstrips thine? or that in me thou seest a free woman? Am I so elated by my youth, my full healthy figure, the extent of my city, the number of my friends that I wish to supplant thee in thy home? Is my purpose to take thy place and rear myself a race of slaves, mere appendages to my misery? or, supposing thou bear no children, will any one endure that sons of mine should rule o'er Phthia? Ah no! there is the love that Hellas bears me, both for Hector's sake and for my own humble rank forsooth, that never knew a queen's estate in Troy. 'Tis not my sorcery that makes thy husband hate thee, nay, but thy own failure to prove thyself his help-meet. Herein lies love's only charm; 'tis not beauty, lady, but virtuous acts that win our husbands' hearts. And though it gall thee to be told so, albeit thy city in Laconia is no doubt mighty fact, yet thou findest no place for his Scyros, displaying wealth 'midst poverty and setting Menelaus above Achilles: and that is what alienates thy lord. Take heed; for a woman, though bestowed upon worthless husband, must be with him content, and ne'er advance presumptuous claims. Suppose thou hadst wedded a prince of Thrace, the land of flood and melting snow, where one lord shares his affections with a host of wives, wouldst thou have slain them? If so, thou wouldst have set a stigma of insatiate lust on all our sex. A shameful charge! And yet herein we suffer more than men, though we make a good stand against it. Ah! my dear lord Hector, for thy sake would I e'en brook a rival, if ever Cypris led thee astray, and oft in days gone by I held thy bastard babes to my own breast, to spare thee any cause for grief. By this course I bound my husband to me by virtue's chains, whereas thou wilt never so much as let the drops of dew from heaven above settle on thy lord, in thy jealous fear. Oh! seek not to surpass thy mother in hankering after men, for 'tis well that all wise children should avoid the habits of such evil mothers.\nLEADER\nMistress mine, be persuaded to come to terms with her, as far as readily comes within thy power.\nHERMIONE\nWhy this haughty tone, this bandying of words, as if, forsooth, thou, not I, wert the virtuous wife?\nANDROMACHE\nThy present claims at any rate give thee small title thereto.\nHERMIONE\nWoman, may my bosom never harbour such ideas as thine!\nANDROMACHE\nThou art young to speak on such a theme as this.\nHERMIONE\nAs for thee, thou dost not speak thereof, but, as thou canst, dost put it into action against me.\nANDROMACHE\nCanst thou not conceal thy pangs of jealousy?\nHERMIONE\nWhat! doth not every woman put this first of all?\nANDROMACHE\nYes, if her experiences are happy; otherwise, there is no honour in speaking of them.\nHERMIONE\nBarbarians' laws are not a standard for our city.\nANDROMACHE\nAlike in Asia and in Hellas infamy attends base actions.\nHERMIONE\nClever, clever quibbler! yet die thou must and shalt.\nANDROMACHE\nDost see the image of Thetis with her eye upon thee?\nHERMIONE\nA bitter foe to thy country because of the death of Achilles.\nANDROMACHE\n'Twas not I that slew him, but Helen that mother of thine.\nHERMIONE\nPray, is it thy intention to probe my wounds yet deeper?\nANDROMACHE\nBehold, I am dumb, my lips are closed.\nHERMIONE\nTell me that which was my only reason for coming hither.\nANDROMACHE\nNo! all I tell thee is, thou hast less wisdom than thou needest.\nHERMIONE\nWilt thou leave these hallowed precincts of the sea-goddess?\nANDROMACHE\nYes, if I am not to die for it; otherwise, I never will.\nHERMIONE\nSince that is thy resolve, I shall not even wait my lord's return.\nANDROMACHE\nNor yet will I, at any rate ere that, surrender to thee.\nHERMIONE\nI will bring fire to bear on thee, and pay no heed to thy entreaties.\nANDROMACHE\nKindle thy blaze then; the gods will witness it.\nHERMIONE\nAnd make thy flesh to writhe by cruel wounds.\nANDROMACHE\nBegin thy butchery, stain the altar of the goddess with blood, for she will visit thy iniquity.\nHERMIONE\nBarbarian creature, hardened in impudence, wilt thou brave death itself? Still will I find speedy means to make these quit this seat of thy free will; such a bait have I to lure thee with. But I will hide my meaning, which the event itself shall soon declare. Yes, keep thy seat, for I will make thee rise, though molten lead is holding thee there, before Achilles' son, thy trusted champion, arrive.\nHERMIONE departs.\nANDROMACHE\nMy trusted champion, yes! how strange it is, that though some god hath devised cures for mortals against the venom of reptiles, no man ever yet hath discovered aught to cure a woman's venom, which is far worse than viper's sting or scorching flame; so terrible a curse are we to mankind.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nAh! what sorrows did the son of Zeus and Maia herald, in the day he came to Ida's glen, guiding that fair young trio of goddesses, all girded for the fray in bitter rivalry about their beauty, to the shepherd's fold where dwelt the youthful herdsman all alone by the hearth of his lonely hut.\nantistrophe 1\nSoon as they reached the wooded glen, in gushing mountain springs they bathed their dazzling skin, then sought the son of Priam, comparing their rival charms in more than rancorous phrase. But Cypris won the day by her deceitful promises, sweet-sounding words, but fraught with ruthless overthrow to Phrygia's hapless town and Ilium's towers.\nstrophe 2\nWould God his mother had smitten him a cruel death-blow on the head before he made his home on Ida's slopes, in the hour Cassandra, standing by the holy bay-tree, cried out, 'Slay him, for he will bring most grievous bane on Priam's town.' To every prince she went, to every elder sued for the babe's destruction.\nantistrophe 2\nAh! had they listened, Ilium's daughters neer had felt the yoke of slavery, and thou, lady, hadst been established in the royal palace; and Hellas had been freed of all the anguish she suffered during those ten long years her sons went wandering, spear in hand, around the walls of Troy; brides had never been left desolate, nor hoary fathers childless.\nMENELAUS and his retinue enter. He is leading MOLOSSUS by the hand.\nMENELAUS\nBehold I bring thy son with me, whom thou didst steal away to a neighbour's house without my daughter's knowledge. Thou wert so sure this image of the goddess would protect thee and those who hid him, but thou hast not proved clever enough for Menelaus. And so if thou refuse to leave thy station here, he shall be slain instead of thee. Wherefore weigh it well: wilt die thyself, or see him slain for the sin whereof thou art guilty against me and my daughter?\nANDROMACHE\nO fame, fame! full many a man ere now of no account hast thou to high estate exalted. Those, indeed, who truly have a fair repute, I count blest; but those who get it by false pretences, I will never allow have aught but the accidental appearance of wisdom. Thou for instance, caitiff that thou art, didst thou ever wrest Troy from Priam with thy picked troops of Hellenes? thou that hast raised such a storm, at the word of thy daughter, a mere child, and hast entered the lists with a poor captive; unworthy I count thee of Troy's capture, and Troy still more disgraced by thy victory. Those who only in appearance are men of sense make an outward show, but inwardly resemble the common herd, save it be in wealth, which is their chiefest strength.\nCome now, Menelaus, let us carry through this argument. Suppose I am slain by thy daughter, and she work her will on me, yet can she never escape the pollution of murder, and public opinion will make thee too an accomplice in this deed of blood, for thy share in the business must needs implicate thee. But even supposing I escape death myself, will ye kill my child? Even then, how will his father brook the murder of his child? Troy has no such coward's tale to tell of him; nay, he will follow duty's call; his actions will prove him a worthy scion of Peleus and Achilles. Thy daughter will be thrust forth from his house; and what wilt thou say when seeking to betroth her to another? wilt say her virtue made her leave a worthless lord? Nay, that will be false. Who then will wed her? wilt thou keep her without a husband in thy halls, grown grey in widowhood? Unhappy wretch! dost not see the flood-gates of trouble opening wide for thee? How many a wrong against a wife wouldst thou prefer thy daughter to have found to suffering what I now describe? We ought not on trifling grounds to promote great ills; nor should men, if we women are so deadly a curse, bring their nature down to our level. No! if, as thy daughter asserts, I am practising sorcery against her and making her barren, right willingly will I, without any crouching at altars, submit in my own person to the penalty that lies in her husband's hands, seeing that I am no less chargeable with injuring him if I make him childless. This is my case; but for thee, there is one thing I fear in thy disposition; it was a quarrel for a woman that really induced thee to destroy poor Ilium's town.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nThou hast said too much for a woman speaking to men; that discretion hath shot away its last shaft from thy soul's quiver.\nMENELAUS\nWomen, these are petty matters, unworthy, as thou sayest, of my despotic sway, unworthy too of Hellas. Yet mark this well; his special fancy of the hour is of more moment to a man than Troy's capture. I then have set myself to help my daughter because I consider her loss of wife's rights most grave; for whatever else a woman suffers is second to this; if she loses her husband's love she loses her life therewith. Now, as it is right Neoptolemus should rule my slaves, so my friends and I should have control of his; for friends, if they be really friends, keep nothing to themselves, but have all in common. So if I wait for the absent instead of making the best arrangement I can at once of my affairs, I show weakness, not wisdom. Arise then, leave the goddess's shrine, for by thy death this child escapeth his, whereas, if thou refuse to die, I will slay him; for one of you twain must perish.\nANDROMACHE\nAh me! 'tis a bitter lot thou art offering about my life; whether I take it or not I am equally unfortunate. Attend to me, thou who for a trifling cause art committing an awful crime. Why art thou bent on slaying me? What reason hast thou? What city have I betrayed? Which of thy children was ever slain by me? What house have I fired? I was forced to be my master's concubine; and spite of that wilt thou slay me, not him who is to blame, passing by the cause and hurrying to the inevitable result? Ah me! my sorrows! Woe for my hapless country! How cruel my fate! Why had I to be a mother too and take upon me a double load of suffering? Yet why do I mourn the past, and o'er the present never shed a tear or compute its griefs? I that saw Hector butchered and dragged behind the chariot, and Ilium, piteous sight! one sheet of flame, while I was baled away by the hair of my head to the Argive ships in slavery, and on my arrival in Phthia was given to Hector's murderer as his mistress. What pleasure then has life for me? Whither am I to turn my gaze? to the present or the past? My babe alone was left me, the light of my life, and him these ministers of death would slay. No! they shall not, if my poor life can save him; for if he be saved, hope in him lives on, while to me 'twere shame to refuse to die for my son. Lo! here I leave the altar and give myself into your hands, to cut or stab, to bind or hang. Ah! my child, to Hades now thy mother passes to save thy dear life. Yet if thou escape thy doom, remember me, my sufferings and my death, and tell thy father how I fared, with fond caress and streaming eye and arms thrown round his neck. Ah! yes, his children are to every man as his own soul; and whoso sneers at this through inexperience, though he suffers less anguish, yet tastes the bitter in his cup of bliss.\nLEADER\nThy tale with pity fills me; for every man alike, stranger though he be, feels pity for another's distress. Menelaus, 'tis thy duty to reconcile thy daughter and this captive, giving her a respite from sorrow.\nMENELAUS\nHo! sirrahs, seize this woman\nHis attendants swiftly carry out the order.\n; hold her fast; for 'tis no welcome story she will have to hear. It was to make thee leave the holy altar of the goddess that I held thy child's death before thy eyes, and so induced thee to give thyself up to me to die. So stands thy case, be well assured; but as for this child, my daughter shall decide whether she will slay him or no. Get thee hence into the house, and there learn to bridle thy insolence in speaking to the free, slave that thou art.\nANDROMACHE\nAlas! thou hast by treachery beguiled me; I was deceived.\nMENELAUS\nProclaim it to the world; I do not deny it.\nANDROMACHE\nIs this counted cleverness amongst you who dwell by the Eurotas?\nMENELAUS\nYes, and amongst Trojans too, that those who suffer should retaliate.\nANDROMACHE\nThinkest thou God's hand is shortened, and that thou wilt not be punished?\nMENELAUS\nWhene'er that comes, I am ready to bear it. But thy life will I have.\nANDROMACHE\nWilt likewise slay this tender chick, whom thou hast snatched from 'neath my wing?\nMENELAUS\nNot I, but I will give him to my daughter to slay if she will.\nANDROMACHE\nAh me! why not begin my mourning then for thee, my child?\nMENELAUS\nOf a truth 'tis no very sure hope that he has left.\nANDROMACHE\nO citizens of Sparta, the bane of all the race of men, schemers of guile, and masters in lying, devisers of evil plots, with crooked minds and tortuous methods and ne'er one honest thought, 'tis wrong that ye should thrive in Hellas. What crime is wanting in your list? How rife is murder with you! How covetous ye are! One word upon your lips, another in your heart, this is what men always find with you. Perdition catch ye! Still death is not so grievous, as thou thinkest, to me. No! for my life ended in the day that hapless Troy was destroyed with my lord, that glorious warrior, whose spear oft made a coward like thee quit the field and seek thy ship. But now against a woman hast thou displayed the terrors of thy panoply, my would-be murderer. Strike then! for this my tongue shall never flatter thee or that daughter of thine. For though thou wert of great account in Sparta, why so was I in Troy. And if I am now in sorry plight, presume not thou on this; thou too mayst be so yet.\nMENELAUS and his guards lead ANDROMACHE out.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nNever, oh! never will I commend rival wives or sons of different mothers, a cause of strife, of bitterness, and grief in every house. would have a husband content with one wife whose rights he shareth with no other.\nantistrophe 1\nNot even in states is dual monarchy better to bear than undivided rule; it only doubles burdens and causes faction amongst the citizens. Often too will the Muse sow strife 'twixt rivals in the art of minstrelsy.\nstrophe 2\nAgain, when strong winds are drifting mariners, the divided counsel of the wise does not best avail for steering, and their collective wisdom has less weight than the inferior mind of the single man who has sole authority; for this is the essence of power alike in house and state, whene'er men care to find the proper moment.\nantistrophe 2\nThis Spartan, the daughter of the great chief Menelaus, proves this; for she hath kindled hot fury against a rival, and is bent on slaying the hapless Trojan maid and her child to further her bitter quarrel. 'Tis a murder gods and laws and kindness all forbid. Ah! lady, retribution for this deed will yet visit thee.\nBut lo! before the house I see those two united souls, condemned to die. Alas! for thee, poor lady, and for thee, unhappy child, who art dying on account of thy mother's marriage, though thou hast no share therein and canst not be blamed by the royal house.\nANDROMACHE enters, her arms bound. Her son clings to her. MENELAUS and the guards follow, intent on accomplishing the murder. The following lines are chanted responsively.\nANDROMACHE\nBehold me journeying on the downward path, my hands so tightly bound with cords that they bleed.\nMOLOSSUS\nO mother, mother mine! I too share thy downward path, nestling 'neath thy wing.\nANDROMACHE\nA cruel sacrifice! ye rulers of Phthia!\nMOLOSSUS\nCome, father! succour those thou lovest.\nANDROMACHE\nRest there, my babe, my darling! on thy mother's bosom, e'en in death and in the grave.\nMOLOSSUS\nAh, woe is me! what will become of me and thee too, mother mine?\nMENELAUS\nAway, to the world below! from hostile towers ye came, the pair of you; two different causes necessitate your deaths; my sentence takes away thy life, and my daughter Hermione's requires his; for it would be the height of folly to leave our foemen's sons, when we might kill them and remove the danger from our house.\nANDROMACHE\nO husband mine! I would I had thy strong arm and spear to aid me, son of Priam.\nMOLOSSUS\nAh, woe is me! what spell can I now find to turn death's stroke aside?\nANDROMACHE\nEmbrace thy master's knees, my child, and pray to him.\nMOLOSSUS\nSpare, O spare my life, kind master!\nANDROMACHE\nMine eyes are wet with tears, which trickle down my cheeks, as doth a sunless spring from a smooth rock. Ah me!\nMOLOSSUS\nWhat remedy, alas! can I provide me 'gainst my ills?\nMENELAUS\nWhy fall at my knees in supplication? hard as the rock and deaf as the wave am I. My own friends have I helped, but for thee have no tie of affection; for verily it cost me a great part of my life to capture Troy and thy mother; so thou shalt reap the fruit thereof and into Hades' halls descend.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nBehold! I see Peleus drawing nigh; with aged step he hasteth hither.\nPELEUS enters with an attendant.\nPELEUS calling out as he comes in sight\nWhat means this? I ask you and your executioner; why is the palace in an uproar? give a reason; what mean your lawless machinations? Menelaus, hold thy hand. Seek not to outrun justice.\nTo his attendant\nForward! faster, faster! for this matter, methinks, admits of no delay; now if ever would I fain resume the vigour of my youth. First however will breathe new life into this captive, being to her as the breeze that blows a ship before the wind. Tell me, by what right have they pinioned thine arms and are dragging thee and thy child away? Like a ewe with her lamb art thou led to the slaughter, while I and thy lord were far away.\nANDROMACHE\nBehold them that are haling me and my child to death, e'en as thou seest, aged prince. Why should I tell thee? For not by one urgent summons alone but by countless messengers have I sent for thee. No doubt thou knowest by hearsay of the strife in this house with this man's daughter, and the reason of my ruin. So now they have torn and are dragging me from the altar of Thetis, the goddess of thy chiefest adoration and the mother of thy gallant son, without any proper trial, yea, and without waiting for my absent master; because, forsooth, they knew my defencelessness and my child's, whom they mean to slay with me his hapless mother, though he has done no harm. But to thee, O sire, I make my supplication, prostrate at thy knees, though my hand cannot touch thy friendly beard; save me, I adjure thee, reverend sir, or to thy shame and my sorrow shall we be slain.\nPELEUS\nLoose her bonds, I say, ere some one rue it; untie her folded hands.\nMENELAUS\nI forbid it, for besides being a match for thee, I have a far better right to her.\nPELEUS\nWhat! art thou come hither to set my house in order? Art not content with ruling thy Spartans?\nMENELAUS\nShe is my captive; I took her from Troy.\nPELEUS\nAye, but my son's son received her as his prize.\nMENELAUS\nIs not all I have his, and all his mine?\nPELEUS\nFor good, but not evil ends; and surely not for murderous violence.\nMENELAUS\nNever shalt thou wrest her from my grasp.\nPELEUS\nWith this good staff I'll stain thy head with blood!\nMENELAUS\nJust touch me and see! Approach one step!\nPELEUS\nWhat! shalt thou rank with men? chief of cowards, son of cowards! What right hast thou to any place 'mongst men? Thou who didst let Phrygian rob thee of thy wife, leaving thy home without bolt or guard, as if forsooth the cursed woman thou hadst there was a model of virtue. No! a Spartan maid could not be chaste, e'en if she would, who leaves her home and bares her limbs and lets her robe float free, to share with youths their races and their sports,-customs I cannot away with. Is it any wonder then that ye fail to educate your women in virtue? Helen might have asked thee this, seeing that she said goodbye to thy affection and tripped off with her young gallant to a foreign land. And yet for her sake thou didst marshal all the hosts of Hellas and lead them to Ilium, whereas thou shouldst have shown thy loathing for her by refusing to stir a spear, once thou hadst found her false; yea, thou shouldst have let her stay there, and even paid a price to save ever having her back again. But that was not at all the way thy thoughts were turned; wherefore many a brave life hast thou ended, and many an aged mother hast thou left childless in her home, and grey-haired sires of gallant sons hast reft. Of that sad band am I member, seeing in thee Achilles' murderer like a malignant fiend; for thou and thou alone hast returned from Troy without a scratch, bringing back thy splendid weapons in their splendid cases just as they went. As for me, I ever told that amorous boy to form no alliance with thee nor take unto his home an evil mother's child; for daughters bear the marks of their mothers' ill-repute into their new homes. Wherefore, ye wooers, take heed to this my warning: 'Choose the daughter of a good mother.' And more than this, with what wanton insult didst thou treat thy brother, bidding him sacrifice his daughter in his simpleness! So fearful wast thou of losing thy worthless wife. Then after capturing Troy,-for thither too will I accompany thee,-thou didst not slay that woman, when she was in thy power; but as soon as thine eyes caught sight of her breast, thy sword was dropped and thou didst take her kisses, fondling the shameless traitress, too weak to stem thy hot desire, thou caitiff wretch! Yet spite of all thou art the man to come and work havoc in my grandson's halls when he is absent, seeking to slay with all indignity a poor weak woman and her babe: but that babe shall one day make thee and thy daughter in thy home rue it, e'en though his birth be trebly base. Yea, for oft ere now hath seed, sown on barren soil, prevailed o'er rich deep tilth, and many bastard has proved a better man than children better born. Take thy daughter hence with thee! Far better is it for mortals to have a poor honest man either as married kin or friend than a wealthy knave; but as for thee, thou art a thing of naught.\nLEADER\nThe tongue from trifling causes contrives to breed great strife 'mongst men; wherefore are the wise most careful not to bring about a quarrel with their friends.\nMENELAUS\nWhy, pray, should one call these old men wise, or those who once had a reputation in Hellas for being so? when thou, the great Peleus, son of famous father, kin to me through marriage, employest language disgraceful to thyself and abusive of me because of a barbarian woman, though thou shouldst have banished her far beyond the streams of Nile or Phasis, and ever encouraged me; seeing that she comes from Asia's continent where fell so many of the sons of Hellas, victims to the spear; and likewise because she shared in the spilling of thy son's blood; for Paris who slew thy son Achilles, was brother to Hector, whose wife she was. And dost thou enter the same abode with her, and deign to let her share thy board, and suffer her to rear her brood of vipers in thy house? But I, after all this foresight for thee, old man, and myself, am to have her torn from my clutches for wishing to slay her. Yet come now, for 'tis no disgrace to argue; suppose my daughter has no child, while this woman's sons grow up, wilt thou set them up to rule the land of Phthia, barbarians born and bred to lord it over Hellenes? Am I then so void of sense because I hate injustice, and thou so full of cleverness? Consider yet another point; say thou hadst given a daughter of thine to some citizen, and hadst then seen her thus treated, wouldst thou have sat looking on in silence? I trow not. Dost thou then for a foreigner rail thus at thy nearest friends? Again, thou mayst say, husband and wife have an equally strong case if she is wronged by him, and similarly if he find her guilty of indiscretion in his house; yet while he has ample powers in his own hands, she depends on parents and friends for her case. Surely then I am right in helping my own kin! Thou art in thy dotage; for thou wilt do me more good by speaking of my generalship than by concealing it. Helen's trouble was not of her own choosing, but sent by heaven, and it proved a great benefit to Hellas; her sons, till then untried in war or arms, turned to deeds of prowess, and it is experience which teaches man all he knows. I showed my wisdom in refraining from slaying my wife, directly I caught sight of her. Would that thou too hadst ne'er slain Phocus! All this I bring before thee in pure good-will, not from anger. But if thou resent it, thy tongue may wag till it ache, yet shall I gain by prudent forethought.\nLEADER\nCease now from idle words, 'twere better far, for fear ye both alike go wrong.\nPELEUS\nAlas! what evil customs now prevail in Hellas! Whene'er the host sets up a trophy o'er the foe, men no more consider this the work of those who really toiled, but the general gets the credit for it. Now he was but one among ten thousand others to brandish his spear; he only did the work of one; but yet he wins more praise than they. Again, as magistrates in all the grandeur of office they scorn the common folk, though they are naught themselves; whereas those others are ten thousand times more wise than they, if daring combine with judgment. Even so thou and thy brother, exalted by the toilsome efforts of others, now take your seats in all the swollen pride of Trojan fame and Trojan generalship. But I will teach thee henceforth to consider Idaean Paris a foe less terrible than Peleus, unless forthwith thou pack from this roof, thou and thy childless daughter too, whom my own true son will hale through his halls by the hair of her head; for her barrenness will not let her endure fruitfulness in others, because she has no children herself. Still if misfortune prevents her bearing offspring, is that a reason why we should be left childless? Begone! ye varlets, let her go! I will soon see if anyone will hinder me from loosing her hands.\nto ANDROMACHE\nArise; these trembling hands of mine will untie the twisted thongs that bind thee. Out on thee, coward! is this how thou hast galled her wrists? Didst think thou wert lashing up a lion or bull? or wert afraid she would snatch a sword and defend herself against thee? Come, child, nestle to thy mother's arms; help me loose her bonds; I will yet rear thee in Phthia to be their bitter foe. If your reputation for prowess and the battles ye have fought were taken from you Spartans, in all else, be very sure, you have not your inferiors.\nLEADER\nThe race of old men practises no restraint; and their testiness makes it hard to check them.\nMENELAUS\nThou art only too ready to rush into abuse; while, as for me, I came to Phthia by constraint and have therefore no intention either of doing or suffering anything mean. Now must I return home, for I have no time to waste; for there is a city not so very far from Sparta, which aforetime was friendly but now is hostile; against her will I march with my army and bring her into subjection. And when I have arranged that matter as I wish, I will return; and face to face with my son-in-law I will give my version of the story and hear his. And if he punish her, and for the future she exercise self-control, she shall find me do the like; but if he storm, I'll storm as well; and every act of mine shall be a reflex of his own. As for thy babbling, I can bear it easily; for, like to a shadow as thou art, thy voice is all thou hast, and thou art powerless to do aught but talk.\nMENELAUS and his retinue withdraw.\nPELEUS\nLead on, my child, safe beneath my sheltering wing, and thou too, poor lady; for thou art come into a quiet haven after the rude storm.\nANDROMACHE\nHeaven reward thee and all thy race, old sire, for having saved my child and me his hapless mother! Only beware lest they fall upon us twain in some lonely spot upon the road and force me from thee, when they see thy age, my weakness, and this child's tender years; take heed to this, that we be not a second time made captive, after escaping now.\nPELEUS\nForbear such words, prompted by a woman's cowardice. Go on thy way; who will lay a finger on you? Methinks he will do it to his cost, For by heaven's grace I rule o'er many a knight and spearman bold in my kingdom of Phthia; yea, and myself can still stand straight, no bent old man as thou dost think; such a fellow as that a mere look from me will put to flight in spite of my years. For e'en an old man, be he brave, is worth a host of raw youths; for what avails a fine figure if a man is coward?\nPELEUS, ANDROMACHE, and MOLOSSUS go out.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe\nOh! to have never been born, or sprung from noble sires, the heir to mansions richly stored; for if aught untoward e'er befall, there is no lack of champions for sons of noble parents, and there is honour and glory for them when they are proclaimed scions of illustrious lines; time detracts not from the legacy these good men leave, but the light of their goodness still burns on when they are dead.\nantistrophe\nBetter is it not to win a discreditable victory, than to make justice miscarry by an invidious exercise of power; for such a victory, though men think it sweet for the moment, grows barren in time and comes near being a stain on a house. This is the life I commend, this the life I set before me as my ideal, to exercise no authority beyond what is right either in the marriage-chamber or in the state.\nepode\nO aged son of Aeacus! now am I sure that thou wert with the Lapithae, wielding thy famous spear, when they fought the Centaurs; and on Argo's deck didst pass the cheerless strait beyond the sea-beat Symplegades on her voyage famed; and when in days long gone the son of Zeus spread slaughter round Troy's famous town, thou too didst share his triumphant return to Europe.\nThe NURSE OF HERMIONE enters.\nNURSE\nAlas! good friends, what a succession of troubles is to-day provided us! My mistress Hermione within the house, deserted by her father and in remorse for her monstrous deed in plotting the death of Andromache and her child, is bent on dying; for she is afraid her husband will in requital for this expel her with dishonour from his house or put her to death, because she tried to slay the innocent. And the servants that watch her can scarce restrain her efforts to hang herself, scarce catch the sword and wrest it from her hand. So bitter is her anguish, and she hath recognized the villainy of her former deeds. As for me, friends, I am weary of keeping my mistress from the fatal noose; do ye go in and try to save her life; for if strangers come, they prove more persuasive than the friends of every day.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nAh yes! I hear an outcry in the house amongst the servants, confirming the news thou hast brought. Poor sufferer! she seems about to show lively grief for her grave crimes; for she has escaped her servants' hands and is rushing from the house, eager to end her life.\nHERMIONE enters, in agitation. She is carrying a sword which the NURSE wrests from her.\nHERMIONE chanting\nWoe, woe is me! I will rend my hair and tear cruel furrows in my cheeks.\nNURSE\nMy child, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou disfigure thyself?\nHERMIONE chanting\nAh me! ah me! Begone, thou fine-spun veil! float from my head away!\nNURSE\nDaughter, cover up thy bosom, fasten thy robe.\nHERMIONE chanting\nWhy should I cover it? My crimes against my lord are manifest and clear, they cannot be hidden.\nNURSE\nArt so grieved at having devised thy rival's death?\nHERMIONE chanting\nYea, I deeply mourn my fatal deeds of daring; alas! I am now accursed in all men's eyes!\nNURSE\nThy husband will pardon thee this error.\nHERMIONE chanting\nOh! why didst thou hunt me to snatch away my sword? Give, oh! give it back, dear nurse, that I may thrust it through my heart Why dost thou prevent me hanging myself?\nNURSE\nWhat! was I to let thy madness lead thee on to death?\nHERMIONE chanting\nAh me, my destiny! Where can I find some friendly fire? To what rocky height can I climb above the sea or 'mid some wooded mountain glen, there to die and trouble but the dead?\nNURSE\nWhy vex thyself thus? on all of us sooner or later heaven's visitation comes.\nHERMIONE chanting\nThou hast left me, O my father, left me like a stranded bark, all alone, without an oar. My lord will surely slay me; no home is mine henceforth beneath my husband's roof. What god is there to whose statue I can as a suppliant haste? or shall I throw myself in slavish wise at slavish knees? Would I could speed away from Phthia's land on bird's dark pinion, or like that pine-built ship, the first that ever sailed betwixt the rocks Cyanean!\nNURSE\nMy child, I can as little praise thy previous sinful excesses, committed against the Trojan captive, as thy present exaggerated terror. Thy husband will never listen to a barbarian's weak pleading and reject his marriage with thee for this. For thou wast no captive from Troy whom he wedded, but the daughter of a gallant sire, with a rich dower, from a city too of no mean prosperity. Nor will thy father forsake thee, as thou dreadest, and allow thee to be cast out from this house. Nay, enter now, nor show thyself before the palace, lest the sight of thee there bring reproach upon thee, my daughter.\nThe NURSE departs as ORESTES and his attendants enter.\nLEADER\nLo! a stranger of foreign appearance from some other land comes hurrying towards us.\nORESTES\nWomen of this foreign land! is this the home, the palace of Achilles' son?\nLEADER\nThou hast it; but who art thou to ask such a question?\nORESTES\nThe son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, by name Orestes, on ply way to the oracle of Zeus at Dodona. But now that I am come to Phthia, I am resolved to inquire about my kinswoman, Hermione of Sparta; is she alive and well? for though she dwells in a land far from my own, I love her none the less.\nHERMIONE\nSon of Agamemnon, thy appearing is as a haven from the storm to sailors; by thy knees I pray, have pity on me in my distress, on me of whose fortunes thou art inquiring. About thy knees I twine my arms with all the force of sacred fillets.\nORESTES\nHa! what is this? Am I mistaken or do I really see before me the queen of this palace, the daughter of Menelaus?\nHERMIONE\nThe same, that only child whom Helen, daughter of Tyndareus, bore my father in his halls; never doubt that.\nORESTES\nO saviour Phoebus, grant us respite from our woe! But what is the matter? art thou afflicted by gods or men?\nHERMIONE\nPartly by myself, partly by the man who wedded me, and partly by some god. On every side I see ruin.\nORESTES\nWhy, what misfortune could happen to a woman as yet childless, unless her honour is concerned?\nHERMIONE\nMy very ill! Thou hast hit my case exactly.\nORESTES\nOn whom has thy husband set his affections in thy stead?\nHERMIONE\nOn his captive, Hector's wife.\nORESTES\nAn evil case indeed, for a man to have two wives!\nHERMIONE\n'Tis even thus. So I resented it.\nORESTES\nDidst thou with woman's craft devise a plot against thy rival?\nHERMIONE\nYes, to slay her and her bastard child.\nORESTES\nAnd didst thou slay them, or did something happen to rescue them from thee?\nHERMIONE\nIt was old Peleus, who showed regard to the weaker side.\nORESTES\nHadst thou any accomplice in this attempted murder?\nHERMIONE\nMy father came from Sparta for this very purpose.\nORESTES\nAnd was he after all defeated by that old man's prowess?\nHERMIONE\nOh no! but by shame; and he hath gone and left me all alone.\nORESTES\nI understand; thou art afraid of thy husband for what thou hast done.\nHERMIONE\nThou hast guessed it; for he will have a right to slay me. What can say for myself? Yet I beseech thee by Zeus the god of our family, send me to a land as far as possible from this, or to my father's house; for these very walls seem to cry out 'Begone!' and all the land of Phthia hates me. But if my lord return ere that from the oracle of Phoebus, he will put me to death on a shameful charge, or enslave me to his mistress, whom ruled before. Maybe some one will say, 'How was it thou didst go thus astray?' I was ruined by evil women who came to me and puffed me up with words like these: 'Wait! wilt thou suffer that vile captive, a mere bondmaid, to dwell within thy house and share thy wedded rights? By Heaven's queen! if it were my house she should not live to reap my marriage-harvest!' And I listened to the words of these Sirens, the cunning, knavish, subtle praters, and was filled with silly thoughts. What need had I to care about my lord? I had all I wanted, wealth in plenty, a house in which I was mistress, and as for children, mine would be born in wedlock, while hers would be bastards, half-slaves to mine. Oh! never, never,-this truth will I repeat,-should men of sense, who have wives, allow women-folk to visit them in their homes, for they teach them evil; one, to gain some private end, helps to corrupt their honour; another, having made a slip herself, wants a companion in misfortune, while many are wantons; and hence it is men's houses are tainted. Wherefore keep strict guard upon the portals of your houses with bolts and bars; for these visits of strange women lead to no good result, but a world of ill.\nLEADER\nThou hast given thy tongue too free a rein regarding thy own sex. I can pardon thee in this case, but still women ought to smooth over their sisters' weaknesses.\nORESTES\n'Twas sage counsel he gave who taught men to hear the arguments on both sides. I, for instance, though aware of the confusion in this house, the quarrel between thee and Hector's wife, waited awhile and watched to see whether thou wouldst stay here or from fear of that captive art minded to quit these halls. Now it was not so much regard for thy message that brought me thither, as the intention of carrying thee away from this house, if, as now, thou shouldst grant me a chance of saying so. For thou wert mine formerly, but art now living with thy present husband through thy father's baseness; since he, before invading Troy's domains, betrothed thee to me, and then afterwards promised thee to thy present lord, provided he captured the city of Troy.\nSo, as soon as Achilles' son returned hither, I forgave thy father, but entreated the bridegroom to forego his marriage with thee, telling him all I had endured and my present misfortune; I might get a wife, I said, from amongst friends, but outside their circle 'twas no easy task for one exiled like myself from home. Thereat he grew abusive, taunting me with my mother's murder and those blood-boltered fiends. And I was humbled by the fortunes of my house, and though 'tis true, I grieved, yet did I bear my sorrow, and reluctantly departed, robbed of thy promised hand. Now therefore, since thou findest thy fortune so abruptly changed and art fallen thus on evil days and hast no help, I will take thee hence and place thee in thy father's hands. For kinship hath strong claims, and in adversity there is naught better than a kinsman's kindly aid.\nHERMIONE\nAs for my marriage, my father must look to it; 'tis not for me to decide. Yes, take me hence as soon as may be, lest my husband come back to his house before I am gone, or Peleus hear that I am deserting his son's abode and pursue me with his swift steeds.\nORESTES\nRest easy about the old man's power; and, as for Achilles' son with all his insolence to me, never fear him; such a crafty net this hand hath woven and set for his death with knots that none can loose; whereof I will not speak before the time, but, when my plot begins to work, Delphi's rock will witness it. If but my allies in the Pythian land abide by their oaths, this same murderer of his mother will show that no one else shall marry thee my rightful bride. To his cost will he demand satisfaction of King Phoebus for his father's blood; nor shall his repentance avail him though he is now submitting to the god. No! he shall perish miserably by Apollo's hand and my false accusations; so shall he find out my enmity. For the deity upsets the fortune of them that hate him, and suffers them not to be high-minded.\nORESTES and HERMIONE depart.\nCHORUS singing\nstrophe 1\nO Phoebus! who didst fence the hill of Ilium with a fair coronal of towers, and thou, ocean-god! coursing o'er the main with thy dark steeds, wherefore did ye hand over in dishonour your own handiwork to the war-god, master of the spear, abandoning Troy to wretchedness?\nantistrophe 1\nMany a well-horsed car ye yoked on the banks of Simois, and many a bloody tournament did ye ordain with never a prize to win; and Ilium's princes are dead and gone; no longer in Troy is seen the blaze of fire on altars of the gods with the smoke of incense.\nstrophe 2\nThe son of Atreus is no more, slain by the hand of his wife, and she herself hath paid the debt of blood by death, and from her children's hands received her doom. The god's own bidding from his oracle was levelled against her, in the day that Agamemnon's son set forth from Argos and visited his shrine; so he slew her, aye, spilt his own mother's blood. O Phoebus, O thou power divine, how can I believe the story?\nantistrophe 2\nAnon wherever Hellenes gather, was heard the voice of lamentation, mothers weeping o'er their children's fate, as they left their homes to mate with strangers. Ah! thou art not the only one, nor thy dear ones either, on whom the cloud of grief hath fallen. Hellas had to bear the visitation, and thence the scourge crossed to Phrygia's fruitful fields, raining the bloody drops the death-god loves.\nPELEUS enters in haste.\nPELEUS\nYe dames of Phthia, answer my questions. I heard a vague rumour that the daughter of Menelaus had left these halls and fled; so now I am come in hot haste to learn if this be true; for it is the duty of those who are at home to labour in the interests of their absent friends.\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nThou hast heard aright, O Peleus; ill would it become me to hide the evil case in which I now find myself; our queen has fled and left these halls.\nPELEUS\nWhat did she fear? explain that to me.\nLEADER\nShe was afraid her lord would cast her out.\nPELEUS\nIn return for plotting his child's death? surely not?\nLEADER\nYea, and she was afraid of yon captive.\nPELEUS\nWith whom did she leave the house? with her father?\nLEADER\nThe son of Agamemnon came and took her hence.\nPELEUS\nWhat view hath he to further thereby? Will he marry her?\nLEADER\nYes, and he is plotting thy grandson's death.\nPELEUS\nFrom an ambuscade, or meeting him fairly face to face?\nLEADER\nIn the holy place of Loxias, leagued with Delphians.\nPELEUS\nGod help us. This is a present danger. Hasten one of you with all speed to the Pythian altar and tell our friends there what has happened here, ere Achilles' son be slain by his enemies.\nA MESSENGER enters.\nMESSENGER\nWoe worth the day! what evil tidings have I brought for thee, old sire, and for all who love my master! woe is me!\nPELEUS\nAlas! my prophetic soul hath a presentiment.\nMESSENGER\nAged Peleus, hearken! Thy grandson is no more; so grievously is he smitten by the men of Delphi and the stranger from Mycenae.\nLEADER\nAh! what wilt thou do, old man? Fall not; uplift thyself.\nPELEUS\nI am a thing of naught; death is come upon me. My voice is choked, my limbs droop beneath me.\nMESSENGER\nHearken; if thou art eager also to avenge thy friends, lift up thyself and hear what happened.\nPELEUS\nAh, destiny! how tightly hast thou caught me in thy toils, a poor old man at life's extremest verge! But tell me how he was taken from me, my one son's only child; unwelcome as such news is, I fain would hear it.\nMESSENGER\nAs soon as we reached the famous soil of Phoebus, for three whole days were we feasting our eyes with the sight. And this, it seems, caused suspicion; for the folk, who dwell near the god's shrine, began to collect in groups, while Agamemnon's son, going to and fro through the town, would whisper in each man's ear malignant hints: 'Do ye see yon fellow, going in and out of the god's treasure-chambers, which are full of the gold stored there by all mankind? He is come hither a second time on the same mission as before, eager to sack the temple of Phoebus.' Thereon there ran an angry murmur through the city, and the magistrates flocked to their council-chamber, while those, who have charge of the god's treasures, had a guard privately placed amongst the colonnades. But we, knowing naught as yet of this, took sheep fed in the pastures of Parnassus, and went our way and stationed ourselves at the altars with vouchers and Pythian seers. And one said: 'What prayer, young warrior, wouldst thou have us offer to the god? Wherefore art thou come?' And he answered: 'I wish to make atonement to Phoebus for my past transgression; for once I claimed from him satisfaction for my father's blood.' Thereupon the rumour, spread by Orestes, proved to have great weight, suggesting that my master was lying and had come on a shameful errand. But he crosses the threshold of the temple to pray to Phoebus before his oracle, and was busy with his burnt-offering; when a body of men armed with swords set themselves in ambush against him in the cover of the bay-trees, and Clytemnestra's son, that had contrived the whole plot was one of them. There stood the young man praying to the god in sight of all, when lo! with their sharp swords they stabbed Achilles' unprotected son from behind. But he stepped back, for it was not a mortal wound he had received, and drew his sword, and snatching armour from the pegs where it hung on a pillar, took his stand upon the altar-steps, the picture of a warrior grim; then cried he to the sons of Delphi, and asked them: 'Why seek to slay me when I am come on a holy mission? What cause is there why I should die? But of all that throng of bystanders, no man answered him a word, but they set to hurling stones. Then he, though bruised and battered by the showers of missiles from all sides, covered himself behind his mail and tried to ward off the attack, holding his shield first here, then there, at arm's length, but all of no avail; for a storm of darts, arrows and javelins, hurtling spits with double points, and butchers' knives for slaying steers, came flying at his feet; and terrible was the war-dance thou hadst then seen thy grandson dance to avoid their marksmanship. At last, when they were hemming him in on all sides, allowing him no breathing space, he left the shelter of the altar, the hearth where victims are placed, and with one bound was on them as on the Trojans of yore; and they turned and fled like doves when they see the hawk. Many fell in the confusion: some wounded, and others trodden down by one another along the narrow passages; and in that hushed holy house uprose unholy din and echoed back from the rocks. Calm and still my master stood there in his gleaming harness like a flash of light, till from the inmost shrine there came a voice of thrilling horror, stirring the crowd to make a stand. Then fell Achilles' son, smitten through the flank by some Delphian's biting blade, some fellow that slew him with a host to help; and as he fell, there was not one that did not stab him, or cast a rock and batter his corpse. So his whole body, once so fair, was marred with savage wounds. At last they cast the lifeless clay, Iying near the altar, forth from the fragrant fane. And we gathered up his remains forthwith and are bringing them to thee, old prince, to mourn and weep and honour with a deep-dug tomb.\nThis is how that prince who vouchsafeth oracles to others, that judge of what is right for all the world, hath revenged himself on Achilles' son, remembering his ancient quarrel as a wicked man would. How then can he be wise?\nThe MESSENGER withdraws as the body of Neoptolemus is carried in on a bier. The following lines between PELEUS and the CHORUS are chanted responsively.\nCHORUS\nLo! e'en now our prince is being carried on a bier from Delphi's land unto his home. Woe for him and his sad fate, and woe for thee, old sire! for this is not the welcome thou wouldst give Achilles' son, the lion's whelp; thyself too by this sad mischance dost share his evil lot.\nPELEUS\nAh! woe is me! here is a sad sight for me to see and take unto my halls! Ah me! ah me! I am undone, thou city of Thessaly! My line now ends; I have no children left me in my home. Oh! the sorrows seem born to endure! What friend can I look to for relief? Ah, dear lips, and cheeks, and hands! Would thy destiny had slain the 'neath Ilium's walls beside the banks of Simois!\nCHORUS\nHad he so died, my aged lord, he had won him honour thereby, and thine had been the happier lot.\nPELEUS\nO marriage, marriage, woe to thee! thou bane of my home, thou destroyer of my city! Ah my child, my boy, would that the honour of wedding thee, fraught with evil as it was to my children and house, had not thrown o'er thee, my son, Hermione's deadly net! that the thunderbolt had slain her sooner! and that thou, rash mortal, hadst never charged the great god Phoebus with aiming that murderous shaft that spilt thy hero-father's blood!\nCHORUS\nWoe! woe! alas! With due observance of funeral rites will I begin the mourning for my dead master.\nPELEUS\nAlack and well-a-day! I take up the tearful dirge, ah me! old and wretched as I am.\nCHORUS\n'Tis Heaven's decree; God willed this heavy stroke.\nPELEUS\nO darling child, thou hast left me all alone in my halls, old and childless by thy loss.\nCHORUS\nThou shouldst have died, old sire, before thy children.\nPELEUS\nShall I not tear my hair, and smite upon my head with grievous blows? O city! of both my children hath Phoebus robbed me.\nCHORUS\nWhat evils thou hast suffered, what sorrows thou hast seen, thou poor old man! what shall be thy life hereafter?\nPELEUS\nChildless, desolate, with no limit to my grief, I must drain the cup of woe, until I die.\nCHORUS\n'Twas all in vain the gods wished thee joy on thy wedding day.\nPELEUS\nAll my hopes have flown away, fallen short of my high boasts.\nCHORUS\nA lonely dweller in a lonely home art thou.\nPELEUS\nI have no city any longer; there! on the ground my sceptre do cast; and thou, daughter of Nereus, 'neath thy dim grotto, shalt see me grovelling in the dust, a ruined king.\nCHORUS\nLook, look!\nA dim form of divine appearance is seen hovering mid air.\nWhat is that moving? what influence divine am I conscious of? Look, maidens, mark it well; see, yonder is some deity, wafted through the lustrous air and alighting on the plains of Phthia, home of steeds.\nTHETIS from above\nO Peleus! because of my wedded days with thee now long agone, I Thetis am come from the halls of Nereus. And first I counsel thee not to grieve to excess in thy present distress, for I too who need ne'er have borne children to my sorrow, have lost the child of our love, Achilles swift of foot, foremost of the sons of Hellas. Next will I declare why I am come, and do thou give ear. Carry yonder corpse, Achilles' son, to the Pythian altar and there bury it, a reproach to Delphi, that his tomb may proclaim the violent death he met at the hand of Orestes. And for his captive wife Andromache,-she must dwell in the Molossian land, united in honourable wedlock with Helenus, and with her this babe, the sole survivor as he is of all the line of Aeacus, for from him a succession of prosperous kings of Molossia is to go on unbroken; for the race that springs from thee and me, my aged lord, must not thus be brought to naught; no! nor Troy's line either; for her fate too is cared for by the gods, albeit her fall was due to the eager wish of Pallas. Thee too, that thou mayst know the saving grace of wedding me, will I, a goddess born and daughter of a god, release from all the ills that flesh is heir to and make a deity to know not death nor decay. From henceforth in the halls of Nereus shalt thou dwell with me, god and goddess together; thence shalt thou rise dry-shod from out the main and see Achilles, our dear son, settled in his island-home by the strand of Leuce, that is girdled by the Euxine sea. But get thee to Delphi's god-built town, carrying this corpse with thee, and, after thou hast buried him, return and settle in the cave which time hath hollowed in the Sepian rock and there abide, till from the sea I come with choir of fifty Nereids to be thy escort thence; for fate's decree thou must fulfil; such is the pleasure of Zeus. Cease then to mourn the dead; this is the lot which heaven assigns to all, and all must pay their debt to death.\nPELEUS\nGreat queen, my honoured wife, from Nereus sprung, all hail! thou art acting herein as befits thyself and thy children. So I will stay my grief at thy bidding, goddess, and, when I have buried the dead, will seek the glens of Pelion, even the place where I took thy beauteous form to my embrace. Surely after this every prudent man will seek to marry a wife of noble stock and give his daughter to a husband good and true, never setting his heart on a worthless woman, not even though she bring a sumptuous dowry to his house. So would men ne'er suffer ill at heaven's hand.\nTHETIS vanishes.\nCHORUS chanting\nMany are the shapes of Heaven's denizens, and many a thing they bring to pass contrary to our expectation; that which we thought would be is not accomplished, while for the unexpected God finds out a way. E'en such hath been the issue of this matter.",

    "content":"THE BACCHAE\n[Pg 6]\nCHARACTERS IN THE PLAY\nDionysus, the God; son of Zeus and of the Theban princess Semelê.\nCadmus, formerly King of Thebes, father of Semelê.\nPentheus, King of Thebes, grandson of Cadmus.\nAgâvê, daughter of Cadmus, mother of Pentheus.\nTeiresias, an aged Theban prophet.\nA Soldier of Pentheus' Guard.\nTwo Messengers.\nA Chorus of Inspired Damsels, following Dionysus from the East.\n'The play was first produced after the death of Euripides by his son, who bore the same name, together with the 'Iphigenîa in Aulis' and the 'Alcmaeon,' probably in the year 405 B.C.'\n[Pg 7]\nTHE BACCHAE\nThe background represents the front of the Castle of Pentheus, King of Thebes. At one side is visible the sacred Tomb of Semelê, a little enclosure overgrown with wild vines, with a cleft in the rocky floor of it from which there issues at times steam or smoke. The God Dionysus is discovered alone.\nDionysus.\nBehold, God's Son is come unto this land\nOf Thebes, even I, Dionysus, whom the brand\nOf heaven's hot splendour lit to life, when she\nWho bore me, Cadmus' daughter Semelê,\nDied here. So, changed in shape from God to man,\nI walk again by Dirce's streams and scan\n[Pg 8]Ismenus' shore. There by the castle side\nI see her place, the Tomb of the Lightning's Bride,\nThe wreck of smouldering chambers, and the great\nFaint wreaths of fire undying—as the hate\nDies not, that Hera held for Semelê.\nAye, Cadmus hath done well; in purity\nHe keeps this place apart, inviolate,\nHis daughter's sanctuary; and I have set\nMy green and clustered vines to robe it round.\nFar now behind me lies the golden ground\nOf Lydian and of Phrygian; far away\nThe wide hot plains where Persian sunbeams play,\nThe Bactrian war-holds, and the storm-oppressed\nClime of the Mede, and Araby the Blest,\nAnd Asia all, that by the salt sea lies\nIn proud embattled cities, motley-wise\nOf Hellene and Barbarian interwrought;\nAnd now I come to Hellas—having taught\nAll the world else my dances and my rite\nOf mysteries, to show me in men's sight\nManifest God.\nAnd first of Hellene lands\nI cry thus Thebes to waken; set her hands\nTo clasp my wand, mine ivied javelin,\nAnd round her shoulders hang my wild fawn-skin.\nFor they have scorned me whom it least beseemed,\nSemelê's sisters; mocked my birth, nor deemed\nThat Dionysus sprang from Dian seed.\nMy mother sinned, said they; and in her need,\nWith Cadmus plotting, cloaked her human shame\nWith the dread name of Zeus; for that the flame\nFrom heaven consumed her, seeing she lied to God.\nThus must they vaunt; and therefore hath my rod\n[Pg 9]On them first fallen, and stung them forth wild-eyed\nFrom empty chambers; the bare mountain side\nIs made their home, and all their hearts are flame.\nYea, I have bound upon the necks of them\nThe harness of my rites. And with them all\nThe seed of womankind from hut and hall\nOf Thebes, hath this my magic goaded out.\nAnd there, with the old King's daughters, in a rout\nConfused, they make their dwelling-place between\nThe roofless rocks and shadowy pine trees green.\nThus shall this Thebes, how sore soe'er it smart,\nLearn and forget not, till she crave her part\nIn mine adoring; thus must I speak clear\nTo save my mother's fame, and crown me here\nAs true God, born by Semelê to Zeus.\nNow Cadmus yieldeth up his throne and use\nOf royal honour to his daughter's son\nPentheus; who on my body hath begun\nA war with God. He thrusteth me away\nFrom due drink-offering, and, when men pray,\nMy name entreats not. Therefore on his own\nHead and his people's shall my power be shown.\nThen to another land, when all things here\nAre well, must I fare onward, making clear\nMy godhead's might. But should this Theban town\nEssay with wrath and battle to drag down\nMy maids, lo, in their path myself shall be,\nAnd maniac armies battled after me!\nFor this I veil my godhead with the wan\nForm of the things that die, and walk as Man.\nO Brood of Tmolus o'er the wide world flown,\nO Lydian band, my chosen and mine own,\n[Pg 10]Damsels uplifted o'er the orient deep\nTo wander where I wander, and to sleep\nWhere I sleep; up, and wake the old sweet sound,\nThe clang that I and mystic Rhea found,\nThe Timbrel of the Mountain! Gather all\nThebes to your song round Pentheus' royal hall.\nI seek my new-made worshippers, to guide\nTheir dances up Kithaeron's pine-clad side.\n[As he departs, there comes stealing in from the left a band of fifteen Eastern Women, the light of the sunrise streaming upon their long white robes and ivy-bound hair. They wear fawn-skins over the robes, and carry some of them timbrels, some pipes and other instruments. Many bear the thyrsus, or sacred Wand, made of reed ringed with ivy. They enter stealthily till they see that the place is empty, and then begin their mystic song of worship.\nChorus.\nA Maiden.\nFrom Asia, from the dayspring that uprises,\nTo Bromios ever glorying we came.\nWe laboured for our Lord in many guises;\nWe toiled, but the toil is as the prize is;\nThou Mystery, we hail thee by thy name!\nAnother.\nWho lingers in the road? Who espies us?\nHe shall hide him in his house nor be bold.\nLet the heart keep silence that defies us;\nFor I sing this day to Dionysus\nThe song that is appointed from of old.\n[Pg 11]\nAll the Maidens.\nOh, blessèd he in all wise,\nWho hath drunk the Living Fountain,\nWhose life no folly staineth,\nAnd his soul is near to God;\nWhose sins are lifted, pall-wise,\nAs he worships on the Mountain,\nAnd where Cybele ordaineth,\nOur Mother, he has trod:\nHis head with ivy laden\nAnd his thyrsus tossing high,\nFor our God he lifts his cry;\n'Up, O Bacchae, wife and maiden,\nCome, O ye Bacchae, come;\nOh, bring the Joy-bestower,\nGod-seed of God the Sower,\nBring Bromios in his power\nFrom Phrygia's mountain dome;\nTo street and town and tower,\nOh, bring ye Bromios home!'\nWhom erst in anguish lying\nFor an unborn life's desire,\nAs a dead thing in the Thunder\nHis mother cast to earth;\nFor her heart was dying, dying,\nIn the white heart of the fire;\nTill Zeus, the Lord of Wonder,\nDevised new lairs of birth;\nYea, his own flesh tore to hide him,\nAnd with clasps of bitter gold\nDid a secret son enfold,\n[Pg 12]    And the Queen knew not beside him;\nTill the perfect hour was there;\nThen a hornèd God was found,\nAnd a God with serpents crowned;\nAnd for that are serpents wound\nIn the wands his maidens bear,\nAnd the songs of serpents sound\nIn the mazes of their hair.\nSome Maidens.\nAll hail, O Thebes, thou nurse of Semelê!\nWith Semelê's wild ivy crown thy towers;\nOh, burst in bloom of wreathing bryony,\nBerries and leaves and flowers;\nUplift the dark divine wand,\nThe oak-wand and the pine-wand,\nAnd don thy fawn-skin, fringed in purity\nWith fleecy white, like ours.\nOh, cleanse thee in the wands' waving pride!\nYea, all men shall dance with us and pray,\nWhen Bromios his companies shall guide\nHillward, ever hillward, where they stay,\nThe flock of the Believing,\nThe maids from loom and weaving\nBy the magic of his breath borne away.\nOthers.\nHail thou, O Nurse of Zeus, O Caverned Haunt\nWhere fierce arms clanged to guard God's cradle rare,\nFor thee of old some crested Corybant\nFirst woke in Cretan air\n[Pg 13]      The wild orb of our orgies,\nOur Timbrel; and thy gorges\nRang with this strain; and blended Phrygian chant\nAnd sweet keen pipes were there.\nBut the Timbrel, the Timbrel was another's,\nAnd away to Mother Rhea it must wend;\nAnd to our holy singing from the Mother's\nThe mad Satyrs carried it, to blend\nIn the dancing and the cheer\nOf our third and perfect Year;\nAnd it serves Dionysus in the end!\nA Maiden.\nO glad, glad on the mountains\nTo swoon in the race outworn,\nWhen the holy fawn-skin clings,\nAnd all else sweeps away,\nTo the joy of the red quick fountains,\nThe blood of the hill-goat torn,\nThe glory of wild-beast ravenings,\nWhere the hill-tops catch the day;\nTo the Phrygian, Lydian, mountains!\n'Tis Bromios leads the way.\nAnother Maiden.\nThen streams the earth with milk, yea, streams\nWith wine and nectar of the bee,\nAnd through the air dim perfume steams\nOf Syrian frankincense; and He,\nOur leader, from his thyrsus spray\nA torchlight tosses high and higher,\nA torchlight like a beacon-fire,\nTo waken all that faint and stray;\n[Pg 14]    And sets them leaping as he sings,\nHis tresses rippling to the sky,\nAnd deep beneath the Maenad cry\nHis proud voice rings:\n'Come, O ye Bacchae, come!'\nAll the Maidens.\nHither, O fragrant of Tmolus the Golden,\nCome with the voice of timbrel and drum;\nLet the cry of your joyance uplift and embolden\nThe God of the joy-cry; O Bacchanals, come!\nWith pealing of pipes and with Phrygian clamour,\nOn, where the vision of holiness thrills,\nAnd the music climbs and the maddening glamour,\nWith the wild White Maids, to the hills, to the hills!\nOh, then, like a colt as he runs by a river,\nA colt by his dam, when the heart of him sings,\nWith the keen limbs drawn and the fleet foot a-quiver,\nAway the Bacchanal springs!\nEnter Teiresias. He is an old man and blind, leaning upon a staff and moving with slow stateliness, though wearing the Ivy and the Bacchic fawn-skin.\nTeiresias.\nHo, there, who keeps the gate?—Go, summon me\nCadmus, Agênor's son, who crossed the sea\nFrom Sidon and upreared this Theban hold.\nGo, whosoe'er thou art. See he be told\nTeiresias seeketh him. Himself will gauge\nMine errand, and the compact, age with age,\n[Pg 15]I vowed with him, grey hair with snow-white hair,\nTo deck the new God's thyrsus, and to wear\nHis fawn-skin, and with ivy crown our brows.\nEnter Cadmus from the Castle. He is even older than Teiresias, and wears the same attire.\nCadmus.\nTrue friend! I knew that voice of thine, that flows\nLike mellow wisdom from a fountain wise.\nAnd, lo, I come prepared, in all the guise\nAnd harness of this God. Are we not told\nHis is the soul of that dead life of old\nThat sprang from mine own daughter? Surely then\nMust thou and I with all the strength of men\nExalt him.\nWhere then shall I stand, where tread\nThe dance and toss this bowed and hoary head?\nO friend, in thee is wisdom; guide my grey\nAnd eld-worn steps, eld-worn Teiresias.—Nay;\nI am not weak.\n[At the first movement of worship his manner begins to change; a mysterious strength and exaltation enter into him.\nSurely this arm could smite\nThe wild earth with its thyrsus, day and night,\nAnd faint not! Sweetly and forgetfully\nThe dim years fall from off me!\nTeiresias.\nAs with thee,\nWith me 'tis likewise. Light am I and young,\nAnd will essay the dancing and the song.\n[Pg 16]\nCadmus.\nQuick, then, our chariots to the mountain road.\nTeiresias.\nNay; to take steeds were to mistrust the God.\nCadmus.\nSo be it. Mine old arm shall guide thee there.\nTeiresias.\nThe God himself shall guide! Have thou no care.\nCadmus.\nAnd in all Thebes shall no man dance but we?\nTeiresias.\nAye, Thebes is blinded. Thou and I can see.\nCadmus.\n'Tis weary waiting; hold my hand, friend; so.\nTeiresias.\nLo, there is mine. So linkèd let us go.\nCadmus.\nShall things of dust the Gods' dark ways despise?\nTeiresias.\nOr prove our wit on Heaven's high mysteries?\nNot thou and I! That heritage sublime\nOur sires have left us, wisdom old as time,\nNo word of man, how deep soe'er his thought\nAnd won of subtlest toil, may bring to naught.\n[Pg 17]  Aye, men will rail that I forget my years,\nTo dance and wreathe with ivy these white hairs;\nWhat recks it? Seeing the God no line hath told\nTo mark what man shall dance, or young or old;\nBut craves his honours from mortality\nAll, no man marked apart; and great shall be!\nCadmus (after looking away toward the Mountain).\nTeiresias, since this light thou canst not read,\nI must be seer for thee. Here comes in speed\nPentheus, Echîon's son, whom I have raised\nTo rule my people in my stead.—Amazed\nHe seems. Stand close, and mark what we shall hear.\n[The two stand back, partially concealed, while there enters in hot haste Pentheus, followed by a bodyguard. He is speaking to the Soldier in command.\nPentheus.\nScarce had I crossed our borders, when mine ear\nWas caught by this strange rumour, that our own\nWives, our own sisters, from their hearths are flown\nTo wild and secret rites; and cluster there\nHigh on the shadowy hills, with dance and prayer\nTo adore this new-made God, this Dionyse,\nWhate'er he be!—And in their companies\nDeep wine-jars stand, and ever and anon\nAway into the loneliness now one\nSteals forth, and now a second, maid or dame,\nWhere love lies waiting, not of God! The flame,\nThey say, of Bacchios wraps them. Bacchios! Nay,\n'Tis more to Aphrodite that they pray.\n[Pg 18]  Howbeit, all that I have found, my men\nHold bound and shackled in our dungeon den;\nThe rest, I will go hunt them! Aye, and snare\nMy birds with nets of iron, to quell their prayer\nAnd mountain song and rites of rascaldom!\nThey tell me, too, there is a stranger come,\nA man of charm and spell, from Lydian seas,\nA head all gold and cloudy fragrancies,\nA wine-red cheek, and eyes that hold the light\nOf the very Cyprian. Day and livelong night\nHe haunts amid the damsels, o'er each lip\nDangling his cup of joyance!—Let me grip\nHim once, but once, within these walls, right swift\nThat wand shall cease its music, and that drift\nOf tossing curls lie still—when my rude sword\nFalls between neck and trunk! 'Tis all his word,\nThis tale of Dionysus; how that same\nBabe that was blasted by the lightning flame\nWith his dead mother, for that mother's lie,\nWas re-conceived, born perfect from the thigh\nOf Zeus, and now is God! What call ye these?\nDreams? Gibes of the unknown wanderer? Blasphemies\nThat crave the very gibbet?\nStay! God wot,\nHere is another marvel! See I not\nIn motley fawn-skins robed the vision-seer\nTeiresias? And my mother's father here—\nO depth of scorn!—adoring with the wand\nOf Bacchios?—Father!—Nay, mine eyes are fond;\nIt is not your white heads so fancy-flown!\nIt cannot be! Cast off that ivy crown,\n[Pg 19]O mine own mother's sire! Set free that hand\nThat cowers about its staff.\n'Tis thou hast planned\nThis work, Teiresias! 'Tis thou must set\nAnother altar and another yet\nAmongst us, watch new birds, and win more hire\nOf gold, interpreting new signs of fire!\nBut for thy silver hairs, I tell thee true,\nThou now wert sitting chained amid thy crew\nOf raving damsels, for this evil dream\nThou hast brought us, of new Gods! When once the gleam\nOf grapes hath lit a Woman's Festival,\nIn all their prayers is no more health at all!\nLeader of the Chorus\n(the words are not heard by Pentheus).\nInjurious King, hast thou no care for God,\nNor Cadmus, sower of the Giants' Sod,\nLife-spring to great Echîon and to thee?\nTeiresias.\nGood words, my son, come easily, when he\nThat speaks is wise, and speaks but for the right.\nElse come they never! Swift are thine, and bright\nAs though with thought, yet have no thought at all.\nLo, this new God, whom thou dost flout withal,\nI cannot speak the greatness wherewith He\nIn Hellas shall be great! Two spirits there be,\nYoung Prince, that in man's world are first of worth.\nDêmêtêr one is named; she is the Earth—\nCall her which name thou will!—who feeds man's frame\nWith sustenance of things dry. And that which came\n[Pg 20]Her work to perfect, second, is the Power\nFrom Semelê born. He found the liquid shower\nHid in the grape. He rests man's spirit dim\nFrom grieving, when the vine exalteth him.\nHe giveth sleep to sink the fretful day\nIn cool forgetting. Is there any way\nWith man's sore heart, save only to forget?\nYea, being God, the blood of him is set\nBefore the Gods in sacrifice, that we\nFor his sake may be blest.—And so, to thee,\nThat fable shames him, how this God was knit\nInto God's flesh? Nay, learn the truth of it,\nCleared from the false.—When from that deadly light\nZeus saved the babe, and up to Olympus' height\nRaised him, and Hera's wrath would cast him thence,\nThen Zeus devised him a divine defence.\nA fragment of the world-encircling fire\nHe rent apart, and wrought to his desire\nOf shape and hue, in the image of the child,\nAnd gave to Hera's rage. And so, beguiled\nBy change and passing time, this tale was born,\nHow the babe-god was hidden in the torn\nFlesh of his sire. He hath no shame thereby.\nA prophet is he likewise. Prophecy\nCleaves to all frenzy, but beyond all else\nTo frenzy of prayer. Then in us verily dwells\nThe God himself, and speaks the thing to be.\nYea, and of Ares' realm a part hath he.\nWhen mortal armies, mailèd and arrayed,\nHave in strange fear, or ever blade met blade,\nFled maddened, 'tis this God hath palsied them.\nAye, over Delphi's rock-built diadem\n[Pg 21]Thou yet shalt see him leaping with his train\nOf fire across the twin-peaked mountain-plain,\nFlaming the darkness with his mystic wand,\nAnd great in Hellas.—List and understand,\nKing Pentheus! Dream not thou that force is power;\nNor, if thou hast a thought, and that thought sour\nAnd sick, oh, dream not thought is wisdom!—Up,\nReceive this God to Thebes; pour forth the cup\nOf sacrifice, and pray, and wreathe thy brow.\nThou fearest for the damsels? Think thee now;\nHow toucheth this the part of Dionyse\nTo hold maids pure perforce? In them it lies,\nAnd their own hearts; and in the wildest rite\nCometh no stain to her whose heart is white.\nNay, mark me! Thou hast thy joy, when the Gate\nStands thronged, and Pentheus' name is lifted great\nAnd high by Thebes in clamour; shall not He\nRejoice in his due meed of majesty?\nHowbeit, this Cadmus whom thou scorn'st and I\nWill wear His crown, and tread His dances! Aye,\nOur hairs are white, yet shall that dance be trod!\nI will not lift mine arm to war with God\nFor thee nor all thy words. Madness most fell\nIs on thee, madness wrought by some dread spell,\nBut not by spell nor leechcraft to be cured!\nChorus.\nGrey prophet, worthy of Phoebus is thy word,\nAnd wise in honouring Bromios, our great God.\nCadmus.\nMy son, right well Teiresias points thy road.\nOh, make thine habitation here with us,\nNot lonely, against men's uses. Hazardous\n[Pg 22]Is this quick bird-like beating of thy thought\nWhere no thought dwells.—Grant that this God be naught,\nYet let that Naught be Somewhat in thy mouth;\nLie boldly, and say He Is! So north and south\nShall marvel, how there sprang a thing divine\nFrom Semelê's flesh, and honour all our line.\n[Drawing nearer to Pentheus.\nIs there not blood before thine eyes even now?\nOur lost Actaeon's blood, whom long ago\nHis own red hounds through yonder forest dim\nTore unto death, because he vaunted him\nAgainst most holy Artemis? Oh, beware,\nAnd let me wreathe thy temples. Make thy prayer\nWith us, and walk thee humbly in God's sight.\n[He makes as if to set the wreath on Pentheus' head.\nPentheus.\nDown with that hand! Aroint thee to thy rite,\nNor smear on me thy foul contagion!\n[Turning upon Teiresias.\nThis\nThy folly's head and prompter shall not miss\nThe justice that he needs!—Go, half my guard,\nForth to the rock-seat where he dwells in ward\nO'er birds and wonders; rend the stone with crow\nAnd trident; make one wreck of high and low,\nAnd toss his bands to all the winds of air!\nHa, have I found the way to sting thee, there?\nThe rest, forth through the town! And seek amain\nThis girl-faced stranger, that hath wrought such bane\nTo all Thebes, preying on our maids and wives.\nSeek till ye find; and lead him here in gyves,\nTill he be judged and stoned, and weep in blood\nThe day he troubled Pentheus with his God!\n[The guards set forth in two bodies; Pentheus goes into the Castle.\n[Pg 23]\nTeiresias.\nHard heart, how little dost thou know what seed\nThou sowest! Blind before, and now indeed\nMost mad!—Come, Cadmus, let us go our way,\nAnd pray for this our persecutor, pray\nFor this poor city, that the righteous God\nMove not in anger.—Take thine ivy rod\nAnd help my steps, as I help thine. 'Twere ill,\nIf two old men should fall by the roadway. Still,\nCome what come may, our service shall be done\nTo Bacchios, the All-Father's mystic son.\nO Pentheus, named of sorrow! Shall he claim\nFrom all thy house fulfilment of his name,\nOld Cadmus?—Nay, I speak not from mine art,\nBut as I see—blind words and a blind heart!\n[The two Old Men go off towards the Mountain.\nChorus.\nSome Maidens.\nThou Immaculate on high;\nThou Recording Purity;\nThou that stoopest, Golden Wing,\nEarthward, manward, pitying,\nHearest thou this angry King?\nHearest thou the rage and scorn\n'Gainst the Lord of Many Voices,\nHim of mortal mother born,\nHim in whom man's heart rejoices,\n[Pg 24]        Girt with garlands and with glee,\nFirst in Heaven's sovranty?\nFor his kingdom, it is there,\nIn the dancing and the prayer,\nIn the music and the laughter,\nIn the vanishing of care,\nAnd of all before and after;\nIn the Gods' high banquet, when\nGleams the grape-blood, flashed to heaven;\nYea, and in the feasts of men\nComes his crownèd slumber; then\nPain is dead and hate forgiven!\nOthers.\nLoose thy lips from out the rein;\nLift thy wisdom to disdain;\nWhatso law thou canst not see,\nScorning; so the end shall be\nUttermost calamity!\n'Tis the life of quiet breath,\n'Tis the simple and the true,\nStorm nor earthquake shattereth,\nNor shall aught the house undo\nWhere they dwell. For, far away,\nHidden from the eyes of day,\nWatchers are there in the skies,\nThat can see man's life, and prize\nDeeds well done by things of clay.\nBut the world's Wise are not wise,\nClaiming more than mortal may.\nLife is such a little thing;\nLo, their present is departed,\n[Pg 25]        And the dreams to which they cling\nCome not. Mad imagining\nTheirs, I ween, and empty-hearted!\nDivers Maidens.\nWhere is the Home for me?\nO Cyprus, set in the sea,\nAphrodite's home In the soft sea-foam,\nWould I could wend to thee;\nWhere the wings of the Loves are furled,\nAnd faint the heart of the world.\nAye, unto Paphos' isle,\nWhere the rainless meadows smile\nWith riches rolled From the hundred-fold\nMouths of the far-off Nile,\nStreaming beneath the waves\nTo the roots of the seaward caves.\nBut a better land is there\nWhere Olympus cleaves the air,\nThe high still dell Where the Muses dwell,\nFairest of all things fair!\nO there is Grace, and there is the Heart's Desire.\nAnd peace to adore thee, thou Spirit of Guiding Fire!\nA God of Heaven is he,\nAnd born in majesty;\nYet hath he mirth In the joy of the Earth,\nAnd he loveth constantly\nHer who brings increase,\nThe Feeder of Children, Peace.\n[Pg 26]        No grudge hath he of the great;\nNo scorn of the mean estate;\nBut to all that liveth His wine he giveth,\nGriefless, immaculate;\nOnly on them that spurn\nJoy, may his anger burn.\nLove thou the Day and the Night;\nBe glad of the Dark and the Light;\nAnd avert thine eyes From the lore of the wise,\nThat have honour in proud men's sight.\nThe simple nameless herd of Humanity\nHath deeds and faith that are truth enough for me!\n[As the Chorus ceases, a party of the guards return, leading in the midst of them Dionysus, bound. The Soldier in command stands forth, as Pentheus, hearing the tramp of feet, comes out from the Castle.\nSoldier.\nOur quest is finished, and thy prey, O King,\nCaught; for the chase was swift, and this wild thing\nMost tame; yet never flinched, nor thought to flee,\nBut held both hands out unresistingly—\nNo change, no blanching of the wine-red cheek.\nHe waited while we came, and bade us wreak\nAll thy decree; yea, laughed, and made my hest\nEasy, till I for very shame confessed\nAnd said: 'O stranger, not of mine own will\nI bind thee, but his bidding to fulfil\nWho sent me.'\nAnd those prisoned Maids withal\nWhom thou didst seize and bind within the wall\n[Pg 27]Of thy great dungeon, they are fled, O King,\nFree in the woods, a-dance and glorying\nTo Bromios. Of their own impulse fell\nTo earth, men say, fetter and manacle,\nAnd bars slid back untouched of mortal hand.\nYea, full of many wonders to thy land\nIs this man come. . . .

He overthrew\nAll that high house. And there in wreck for evermore it lies,\nThat the day of this my bondage may be sore in Pentheus' eyes!\nAnd now his sword is fallen, and he lies outworn and wan\nWho dared to rise against his God in wrath, being but man.\nAnd I uprose and left him, and in all peace took my path\nForth to my Chosen, recking light of Pentheus and his wrath.\nBut soft, methinks a footstep sounds even now within the hall;\n[Pg 40]'Tis he; how think ye he will stand, and what words speak withal?\nI will endure him gently, though he come in fury hot.\nFor still are the ways of Wisdom, and her temper trembleth not!\nEnter Pentheus in fury.\nPentheus.\nIt is too much!

Yet\nI first would learn thy pleasure. Shall I set\nMy whole tale forth, or veil the stranger part?\nYea, Lord, I fear the swiftness of thy heart,\nThine edgèd wrath and more than royal soul.\nPentheus.\nThy tale shall nothing scathe thee.—Tell the whole.\nIt skills not to be wroth with honesty.\nNay, if thy news of them be dark, 'tis he\nShall pay it, who bewitched and led them on.\nMessenger.\nOur herded kine were moving in the dawn\nUp to the peaks, the greyest, coldest time,\nWhen the first rays steal earthward, and the rime\nYields, when I saw three bands of them. The one\nAutonoë led, one Ino, one thine own\nMother, Agâvê. There beneath the trees\nSleeping they lay, like wild things flung at ease\nIn the forest; one half sinking on a bed\nOf deep pine greenery; one with careless head\nAmid the fallen oak leaves; all most cold\nIn purity—not as thy tale was told\nOf wine-cups and wild music and the chase\nFor love amid the forest's loneliness.\nThen rose the Queen Agâvê suddenly\nAmid her band, and gave the God's wild cry,\n'Awake, ye Bacchanals! I hear the sound\nOf hornèd kine. Awake ye!'—Then, all round,\nAlert, the warm sleep fallen from their eyes,\nA marvel of swift ranks I saw them rise,\n[Pg 43]Dames young and old, and gentle maids unwed\nAmong them. O'er their shoulders first they shed\nTheir tresses, and caught up the fallen fold\nOf mantles where some clasp had loosened hold,\nAnd girt the dappled fawn-skins in with long\nQuick snakes that hissed and writhed with quivering tongue.\nAnd one a young fawn held, and one a wild\nWolf cub, and fed them with white milk, and smiled\nIn love, young mothers with a mother's breast\nAnd babes at home forgotten! Then they pressed\nWreathed ivy round their brows, and oaken sprays\nAnd flowering bryony. And one would raise\nHer wand and smite the rock, and straight a jet\nOf quick bright water came. Another set\nHer thyrsus in the bosomed earth, and there\nWas red wine that the God sent up to her,\nA darkling fountain. And if any lips\nSought whiter draughts, with dipping finger-tips\nThey pressed the sod, and gushing from the ground\nCame springs of milk. And reed-wands ivy-crowned\nRan with sweet honey, drop by drop.—O King,\nHadst thou been there, as I, and seen this thing,\nWith prayer and most high wonder hadst thou gone\nTo adore this God whom now thou rail'st upon!\nHowbeit, the kine-wardens and shepherds straight\nCame to one place, amazed, and held debate;\nAnd one being there who walked the streets and scanned\nThe ways of speech, took lead of them whose hand\nKnew but the slow soil and the solemn hill,\nAnd flattering spoke, and asked: 'Is it your will,\nMasters, we stay the mother of the King,\nAgâvê, from her lawless worshipping,\n[Pg 44]And win us royal thanks?'—And this seemed good\nTo all; and through the branching underwood\nWe hid us, cowering in the leaves. And there\nThrough the appointed hour they made their prayer\nAnd worship of the Wand, with one accord\nOf heart and cry—'Iacchos, Bromios, Lord,\nGod of God born!'—And all the mountain felt,\nAnd worshipped with them; and the wild things knelt\nAnd ramped and gloried, and the wilderness\nWas filled with moving voices and dim stress.\nSoon, as it chanced, beside my thicket-close\nThe Queen herself passed dancing, and I rose\nAnd sprang to seize her. But she turned her face\nUpon me: 'Ho, my rovers of the chase,\nMy wild White Hounds, we are hunted! Up, each rod\nAnd follow, follow, for our Lord and God!'\nThereat, for fear they tear us, all we fled\nAmazed; and on, with hand unweaponèd\nThey swept toward our herds that browsed the green\nHill grass. Great uddered kine then hadst thou seen\nBellowing in sword-like hands that cleave and tear,\nA live steer riven asunder, and the air\nTossed with rent ribs or limbs of cloven tread,\nAnd flesh upon the branches, and a red\nRain from the deep green pines. Yea, bulls of pride,\nHorns swift to rage, were fronted and aside\nFlung stumbling, by those multitudinous hands\nDragged pitilessly. And swifter were the bands\nOf garbèd flesh and bone unbound withal\nThan on thy royal eyes the lids may fall.\nThen on like birds, by their own speed upborne,\nThey swept toward the plains of waving corn\n[Pg 45]That lie beside Asopus' banks, and bring\nTo Thebes the rich fruit of her harvesting.\nOn Hysiae and Erythrae that lie nursed\nAmid Kithaeron's bowering rocks, they burst\nDestroying, as a foeman's army comes.\nThey caught up little children from their homes,\nHigh on their shoulders, babes unheld, that swayed\nAnd laughed and fell not; all a wreck they made;\nYea, bronze and iron did shatter, and in play\nStruck hither and thither, yet no wound had they;\nCaught fire from out the hearths, yea, carried hot\nFlames in their tresses and were scorchèd not!\nThe village folk in wrath took spear and sword,\nAnd turned upon the Bacchae. Then, dread Lord,\nThe wonder was. For spear nor barbèd brand\nCould scathe nor touch the damsels; but the Wand,\nThe soft and wreathèd wand their white hands sped,\nBlasted those men and quelled them, and they fled\nDizzily. Sure some God was in these things!\nAnd the holy women back to those strange springs\nReturned, that God had sent them when the day\nDawned, on the upper heights; and washed away\nThe stain of battle. And those girdling snakes\nHissed out to lap the waterdrops from cheeks\nAnd hair and breast.\nTherefore I counsel thee,\nO King, receive this Spirit, whoe'er he be,\nTo Thebes in glory. Greatness manifold\nIs all about him; and the tale is told\nThat this is he who first to man did give\nThe grief-assuaging vine. Oh, let him live;\nFor if he die, then Love herself is slain,\nAnd nothing joyous in the world again!\n[Pg 46]\nLeader.\nAlbeit I tremble, and scarce may speak my thought\nTo a king's face, yet will I hide it not.\nDionyse is God, no God more true nor higher!\nPentheus.\nIt bursts hard by us, like a smothered fire,\nThis frenzy of Bacchic women! All my land\nIs made their mock.—This needs an iron hand!\nHo, Captain! Quick to the Electran Gate;\nBid gather all my men-at-arms thereat;\nCall all that spur the charger, all who know\nTo wield the orbèd targe or bend the bow;\nWe march to war!—'Fore God, shall women dare\nSuch deeds against us? 'Tis too much to bear!\nDionysus.\nThou mark'st me not, O King, and holdest light\nMy solemn words; yet, in thine own despite,\nI warn thee still. Lift thou not up thy spear\nAgainst a God, but hold thy peace, and fear\nHis wrath! He will not brook it, if thou fright\nHis Chosen from the hills of their delight.\nPentheus.\nPeace, thou! And if for once thou hast slipped thy chain,\nGive thanks!—Or shall I knot thine arms again?\nDionysus.\nBetter to yield him prayer and sacrifice\nThan kick against the pricks, since Dionyse\nIs God, and thou but mortal.\n[Pg 47]\nPentheus.\nThat will I!\nYea, sacrifice of women's blood, to cry\nHis name through all Kithaeron!\nDionysus.\nYe shall fly,\nAll, and abase your shields of bronzen rim\nBefore their wands.\nPentheus.\nThere is no way with him,\nThis stranger that so dogs us! Well or ill\nI may entreat him, he must babble still!\nDionysus.\nWait, good my friend! These crooked matters may\nEven yet be straightened.\n[Pentheus has started as though to seek his army at the gate.\nPentheus.\nAye, if I obey\nMine own slaves' will; how else?\nDionysus.\nMyself will lead\nThe damsels hither, without sword or steed.\nPentheus.\nHow now?—This is some plot against me!\nDionysus.\nWhat\nDost fear? Only to save thee do I plot.\n[Pg 48]\nPentheus.\nIt is some compact ye have made, whereby\nTo dance these hills for ever!\nDionysus.\nVerily,\nThat is my compact, plighted with my Lord!\nPentheus (turning from him).\nHo, armourers! Bring forth my shield and sword!—\nAnd thou, be silent!\nDionysus\n(after regarding him fixedly, speaks with resignation).\nAh!—Have then thy will!\n[He fixes his eyes upon Pentheus again, while the armourers bring out his armour; then speaks in a tone of command.\nMan, thou wouldst fain behold them on the hill\nPraying!\nPentheus\n(who during the rest of this scene, with a few exceptions, simply speaks the thoughts that Dionysus puts into him, losing power over his own mind).\nThat would I, though it cost me all\nThe gold of Thebes!\nDionysus.\nSo much? Thou art quick to fall\nTo such great longing.\nPentheus\n(somewhat bewildered at what he has said).\nAye; 'twould grieve me much\nTo see them flown with wine.\n[Pg 49]\nDionysus.\nYet cravest thou such\nA sight as would much grieve thee?\nPentheus.\nYes; I fain\nWould watch, ambushed among the pines.\nDionysus.\n'Twere vain\nTo hide. They soon will track thee out.\nPentheus.\nWell said!\n'Twere best done openly.\nDionysus.\nWilt thou be led\nBy me, and try the venture?\nPentheus.\nAye, indeed!\nLead on. Why should we tarry?\nDionysus.\nFirst we need\nA rich and trailing robe of fine-linen\nTo gird thee.\nPentheus.\nNay; am I a woman, then,\nAnd no man more?\nDionysus.\nWouldst have them slay thee dead?\nNo man may see their mysteries.\n[Pg 50]\nPentheus.\nWell said!—\nI marked thy subtle temper long ere now.\nDionysus.\n'Tis Dionyse that prompteth me.\nPentheus.\nAnd how\nMean'st thou the further plan?\nDionysus.\nFirst take thy way\nWithin. I will array thee.\nPentheus.\nWhat array?\nThe woman's? Nay, I will not.\nDionysus.\nDoth it change\nSo soon, all thy desire to see this strange\nAdoring?\nPentheus.\nWait! What garb wilt thou bestow\nAbout me?\nDionysus.\nFirst a long tress dangling low\nBeneath thy shoulders.\nPentheus.\nAye, and next?\n[Pg 51]\nDionysus.\nThe said\nRobe, falling to thy feet; and on thine head\nA snood.\nPentheus.\nAnd after? Hast thou aught beyond?\nDionysus.\nSurely; the dappled fawn-skin and the wand.\nPentheus (after a struggle with himself).\nEnough! I cannot wear a robe and snood.\nDionysus.\nWouldst liefer draw the sword and spill men's blood?\nPentheus (again doubting).\nTrue, that were evil.—Aye; 'tis best to go\nFirst to some place of watch.\nDionysus.\nFar wiser so,\nThan seek by wrath wrath's bitter recompense.\nPentheus.\nWhat of the city streets? Canst lead me hence\nUnseen of any?\nDionysus.\nLonely and untried\nThy path from hence shall be, and I thy guide!\nPentheus.\nI care for nothing, so these Bacchanals\nTriumph not against me! . . . Forward to my halls\nWithin!—I will ordain what seemeth best.\n[Pg 52]\nDionysus.\nSo be it, O King!

And there\nThe Maenad maidens sate; in toil they were,\nBusily glad. Some with an ivy chain\nTracked a worn wand to toss its locks again;\nSome, wild in joyance, like young steeds set free,\nMade answering songs of mystic melody.\nBut my poor master saw not the great band\nBefore him. 'Stranger,' cried he, 'where we stand\n[Pg 64]Mine eyes can reach not these false saints of thine.\nMount we the bank, or some high-shouldered pine,\nAnd I shall see their follies clear!' At that\nThere came a marvel. For the Stranger straight\nTouched a great pine-tree's high and heavenward crown,\nAnd lower, lower, lower, urged it down\nTo the herbless floor. Round like a bending bow,\nOr slow wheel's rim a joiner forces to,\nSo in those hands that tough and mountain stem\nBowed slow—oh, strength not mortal dwelt in them!—\nTo the very earth. And there he set the King,\nAnd slowly, lest it cast him in its spring,\nLet back the young and straining tree, till high\nIt towered again amid the towering sky;\nAnd Pentheus in the branches! Well, I ween,\nHe saw the Maenads then, and well was seen!\nFor scarce was he aloft, when suddenly\nThere was no Stranger any more with me,\nBut out of Heaven a Voice—oh, what voice else?—\n'Twas He that called! 'Behold, O damosels,\nI bring ye him who turneth to despite\nBoth me and ye, and darkeneth my great Light.\n'Tis yours to avenge!' So spake he, and there came\n'Twixt earth and sky a pillar of high flame.\nAnd silence took the air, and no leaf stirred\nIn all the forest dell. Thou hadst not heard\nIn that vast silence any wild thing's cry.\nAnd up they sprang; but with bewildered eye,\nAgaze and listening, scarce yet hearing true.\nThen came the Voice again. And when they knew\nTheir God's clear call, old Cadmus' royal brood,\nUp, like wild pigeons startled in a wood,\n[Pg 65]On flying feet they came, his mother blind,\nAgâvê, and her sisters, and behind\nAll the wild crowd, more deeply maddened then,\nThrough the angry rocks and torrent-tossing glen,\nUntil they spied him in the dark pine-tree:\nThen climbed a crag hard by and furiously\nSome sought to stone him, some their wands would fling\nLance-wise aloft, in cruel targeting.\nBut none could strike. The height o'ertopped their rage,\nAnd there he clung, unscathed, as in a cage\nCaught. And of all their strife no end was found.\nThen, 'Hither,' cried Agâvê; 'stand we round\nAnd grip the stem, my Wild Ones, till we take\nThis climbing cat-o'-the-mount! He shall not make\nA tale of God's high dances!' Out then shone\nArm upon arm, past count, and closed upon\nThe pine, and gripped; and the ground gave, and down\nIt reeled. And that high sitter from the crown\nOf the green pine-top, with a shrieking cry\nFell, as his mind grew clear, and there hard by\nWas horror visible. 'Twas his mother stood\nO'er him, first priestess of those rites of blood.\nHe tore the coif, and from his head away\nFlung it, that she might know him, and not slay\nTo her own misery. He touched the wild\nCheek, crying: 'Mother, it is I, thy child,\nThy Pentheus, born thee in Echîon's hall!\nHave mercy, Mother! Let it not befall\nThrough sin of mine, that thou shouldst slay thy son!'\nBut she, with lips a-foam and eyes that run\nLike leaping fire, with thoughts that ne'er should be\nOn earth, possessed by Bacchios utterly,\n[Pg 66]Stays not nor hears. Round his left arm she put\nBoth hands, set hard against his side her foot,\nDrew . . . and the shoulder severed!—Not by might\nOf arm, but easily, as the God made light\nHer hand's essay. And at the other side\nWas Ino rending; and the torn flesh cried,\nAnd on Autonoë pressed, and all the crowd\nOf ravening arms. Yea, all the air was loud\nWith groans that faded into sobbing breath,\nDim shrieks, and joy, and triumph-cries of death.\nAnd here was borne a severed arm, and there\nA hunter's booted foot; white bones lay bare\nWith rending; and swift hands ensanguinèd\nTossed as in sport the flesh of Pentheus dead.\nHis body lies afar. The precipice\nHath part, and parts in many an interstice\nLurk of the tangled woodland—no light quest\nTo find. And, ah, the head! Of all the rest,\nHis mother hath it, pierced upon a wand,\nAs one might pierce a lion's, and through the land,\nLeaving her sisters in their dancing place,\nBears it on high! Yea, to these walls her face\nWas set, exulting in her deed of blood,\nCalling upon her Bromios, her God,\nHer Comrade, Fellow-Render of the Prey,\nHer All-Victorious, to whom this day\nShe bears in triumph . . . her own broken heart!\nFor me, after that sight, I will depart\nBefore Agâvê comes.—Oh, to fulfil\nGod's laws, and have no thought beyond His will,\nIs man's best treasure. Aye, and wisdom true,\nMethinks, for things of dust to cleave unto!\n[The Messenger departs into the Castle.\n[Pg 67]\nChorus.\nSome Maidens.\nWeave ye the dance, and call\nPraise to God!\nBless ye the Tyrant's fall!\nDown is trod\nPentheus, the Dragon's Seed!\nWore he the woman's weed?\nClasped he his death indeed,\nClasped the rod?\nA Bacchanal.\nYea, the wild ivy lapt him, and the doomed\nWild Bull of Sacrifice before him loomed!\nOthers.\nYe who did Bromios scorn,\nPraise Him the more,\nBacchanals, Cadmus-born;\nPraise with sore\nAgony, yea, with tears!\nGreat are the gifts he bears!\nHands that a mother rears\nRed with gore!\nLeader.\nBut stay, Agâvê cometh!

    "content":"THE CYCLOPS OF EURIPIDES\nA SPECIMEN OF THE SATYRIC DRAMA\nScene: Sicily, in front of cave of the Cyclops, Polyphemus.\nPrologue by Silenus, the rural demi-god, who recounts his faithful service to Bacchus, and yet the ungrateful god has let himself and his children fall into this slavery to the horrid Cyclops Polyphemus, where, worst of their many woes, they are debarred from the wine they worship.\nParode: The Chorus of Satyrs driving their goats and lamenting how different this from the merry service of Bacchus.\nEpisode I. Silenus hurries back with the news that a ship is approaching to water in the island: fresh victims for the monster. Enter Ulysses and crew: mutual explanations, all couched in 'burlesque' tone. The mariners have had no food except flesh, and gladly partake milk and fruits of the Satyrs, affording in return to Silenus the long-lost luxury of wine: the scene then going on to paint [with the utmost coarseness] the oncoming of drunkenness.\nSuddenly enter Polyphemus: Ulysses and the crew hide. After some rough bandying between the Monster and the Chorus, the strangers are discovered: and Silenus, to save himself, turns traitor, and tells Polyphemus how they have beaten him because he would not let them steal, also what dire woes they were going to work upon Polyphemus. In spite of their protests Silenus is believed: Ulysses promises, if set free, to erect shrines in Greece for the Cyclops, besides dwelling upon the impiety of attacking innocent strangers: Polyphemus replies that he does not care for shrines, and as for impiety he is independent of Zeus; which gives occasion for a glorification of the life of nature. They are driven into the cave to be fed on at leisure.\nChoral Ode: General disgust at the monster.\nEpisode II. Ulysses [apparently standing at the mouth of the cave] describes Polyphemus gorging—then details his plan of deliverance by aid of the wine.\nChoral Ode: Lyric delight of Chorus at prospect of deliverance.\nEpisode III. The Cyclops appears sated with his banquet, and settling down to this new treat of drinking—the effects of on-coming intoxication are painted again in Polyphemus, with the usual coarseness—a farcical climax being reached when the monster begins to be affectionate to his cup-bearer, old Silenus, in memory of Zeus and his famous cup-bearer, Ganymede.\nChoral Ode: Anticipation of Revenge.\nExodus. The plan of Revenge, the boring out of the Cyclops's one eye while overpowered with drink, is carried out—various farcical effects by the way, e.g., the Chorus drawing back with excuses and leaving Ulysses to do the deed at the critical moment. The Drama ends with the Monster's rage and vain attempts to catch the culprit, Ulysses putting him off with his feigned name 'No man': thus all are delivered.",

    "content":"ELECTRA\nCHARACTERS IN THE PLAY\nCLYTEMNESTRA, Queen of Argos and Mycenae; widow of Agamemnon.\nELECTRA, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra.\nORESTES, son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, now in banishment.\nA PEASANT, husband of Electra.\nAN OLD MAN, formerly servant to Agamemnon.\nPYLADES, son of Strophios, King of Phocis; friend to Orestes.\nAEGISTHUS, usurping King of Argos and Mycenae, now husband of\nClytemnestra.\nThe Heroes CASTOR and POLYDEUCES.\nCHORUS of Argive Women, with their LEADER.\nFOLLOWERS of ORESTES; HANDMAIDS of CLYTEMNESTRA.\nThe Scene is laid in the mountains of Argos. The play was first produced between the years 414 and 412 B.C.\nELECTRA\nThe scene represents a hut on a desolate mountain side; the river Inachus is visible in the distance. The time is the dusk of early dawn, before sunrise. The PEASANT is discovered in front of the hut.\nPEASANT.\nOld gleam on the face of the world, I give thee hail,\nRiver of Argos land, where sail on sail\nThe long ships met, a thousand, near and far,\nWhen Agamemnon walked the seas in war;\nWho smote King Priam in the dust, and burned\nThe storied streets of Ilion, and returned\nAbove all conquerors, heaping tower and fane\nOf Argos high with spoils of Eastern slain.\nSo in far lands he prospered; and at home\nHis own wife trapped and slew him. 'Twas the doom\nAegisthus wrought, son of his father's foe.\nGone is that King, and the old spear laid low\nThat Tantalus wielded when the world was young.\nAegisthus hath his queen, and reigns among\nHis people. And the children here alone,\nOrestes and Electra, buds unblown\nOf man and womanhood, when forth to Troy\nHe shook his sail and left them—lo, the boy\nOrestes, ere Aegisthus' hand could fall,\nWas stolen from Argos—borne by one old thrall,\nWho served his father's boyhood, over seas\nFar off, and laid upon King Strophios' knees\nIn Phocis, for the old king's sake. But here\nThe maid Electra waited, year by year,\nAlone, till the warm days of womanhood\nDrew nigh and suitors came of gentle blood\nIn Hellas. Then Aegisthus was in fear\nLest she be wed in some great house, and bear\nA son to avenge her father. Close he wrought\nHer prison in his house, and gave her not\nTo any wooer. Then, since even this\nWas full of peril, and the secret kiss\nOf some bold prince might find her yet, and rend\nHer prison walls, Aegisthus at the end\nWould slay her. Then her mother, she so wild\nAforetime, pled with him and saved her child.\nHer heart had still an answer for her lord\nMurdered, but if the child's blood spoke, what word\nCould meet the hate thereof? After that day\nAegisthus thus decreed: whoso should slay\nThe old king's wandering son, should win rich meed\nOf gold; and for Electra, she must wed\nWith me, not base of blood—in that I stand\nTrue Mycenaean—but in gold and land\nMost poor, which maketh highest birth as naught.\nSo from a powerless husband shall be wrought\nA powerless peril. Had some man of might\nPossessed her, he had called perchance to light\nHer father's blood, and unknown vengeances\nRisen on Aegisthus yet.\nAye, mine she is:\nBut never yet these arms—the Cyprian knows\nMy truth!—have clasped her body, and she goes\nA virgin still. Myself would hold it shame\nTo abase this daughter of a royal name.\nI am too lowly to love violence. Yea,\nOrestes too doth move me, far away,\nMine unknown brother! Will he ever now\nCome back and see his sister bowed so low?\nDoth any deem me fool, to hold a fair\nMaid in my room and seek no joy, but spare\nHer maidenhood? If any such there be,\nLet him but look within. The fool is he\nIn gentle things, weighing the more and less\nOf love by his own heart's untenderness.\n[As he ceases ELECTRA comes out of the hut. She is in mourning garb, and carries a large pitcher on her head. She speaks without observing the PEASANT'S presence.\nELECTRA.\nDark shepherdess of many a golden star,\nDost see me, Mother Night? And how this jar\nHath worn my earth-bowed head, as forth and fro\nFor water to the hillward springs I go?\nNot for mere stress of need, but purpose set,\nThat never day nor night God may forget\nAegisthus' sin: aye, and perchance a cry\nCast forth to the waste shining of the sky\nMay find my father's ear…. The woman bred\nOf Tyndareus, my mother—on her head\nBe curses!—from my house hath outcast me;\nShe hath borne children to our enemy;\nShe hath made me naught, she hath made Orestes naught….\n[As the bitterness of her tone increases, the PEASANT comes forward.\nPEASANT.\nWhat wouldst thou now, my sad one, ever fraught\nWith toil to lighten my toil? And so soft\nThy nurture was! Have I not chid thee oft,\nAnd thou wilt cease not, serving without end?\nELECTRA (turning to him with impulsive affection).\nO friend, my friend, as God might be my friend,\nThou only hast not trampled on my tears.\nLife scarce can be so hard, 'mid many fears\nAnd many shames, when mortal heart can find\nSomewhere one healing touch, as my sick mind\nFinds thee…. And should I wait thy word, to endure\nA little for thine easing, yea, or pour\nMy strength out in thy toiling fellowship?\nThou hast enough with fields and kine to keep;\n'Tis mine to make all bright within the door.\n'Tis joy to him that toils, when toil is o'er,\nTo find home waiting, full of happy things.\nPEASANT.\nIf so it please thee, go thy way. The springs\nAre not far off. And I before the morn\nMust drive my team afield, and sow the corn\nIn the hollows.—Not a thousand prayers can gain\nA man's bare bread, save an he work amain.\n[ELECTRA and the PEASANT depart on their several ways. After a few moments there enter stealthily two armed men, ORESTES and PYLADES.\nORESTES.\nThou art the first that I have known in deed\nTrue and my friend, and shelterer of my need.\nThou only, Pylades, of all that knew,\nHast held Orestes of some worth, all through\nThese years of helplessness, wherein I lie\nDowntrodden by the murderer—yea, and by\nThe murderess, my mother!… I am come,\nFresh from the cleansing of Apollo, home\nTo Argos—and my coming no man yet\nKnoweth—to pay the bloody twain their debt\nOf blood. This very night I crept alone\nTo my dead father's grave, and poured thereon\nMy heart's first tears and tresses of my head\nNew-shorn, and o'er the barrow of the dead\nSlew a black lamb, unknown of them that reign\nIn this unhappy land…. I am not fain\nTo pass the city gates, but hold me here\nHard on the borders. So my road is clear\nTo fly if men look close and watch my way;\nIf not, to seek my sister. For men say\nShe dwelleth in these hills, no more a maid\nBut wedded. I must find her house, for aid\nTo guide our work, and learn what hath betid\nOf late in Argos.—Ha, the radiant lid\nOf Dawn's eye lifteth! Come, friend; leave we now\nThis trodden path. Some worker of the plough,\nOr serving damsel at her early task\nWill presently come by, whom we may ask\nIf here my sister dwells. But soft! Even now\nI see some bondmaid there, her death-shorn brow\nBending beneath its freight of well-water.\nLie close until she pass; then question her.\nA slave might help us well, or speak some sign\nOf import to this work of mine and thine.\n[The two men retire into ambush. ELECTRA enters, returning from the well.\nELECTRA.\nOnward, O labouring tread,\nAs on move the years;\nOnward amid thy tears,\nO happier dead!\nLet me remember. I am she, [Strophe 1.\nAgamemnon's child, and the mother of me\nClytemnestra, the evil Queen,\nHelen's sister. And folk, I ween,\nThat pass in the streets call yet my name\nElectra…. God protect my shame!\nFor toil, toil is a weary thing,\nAnd life is heavy about my head;\nAnd thou far off, O Father and King,\nIn the lost lands of the dead.\nA bloody twain made these things be;\nOne was thy bitterest enemy,\nAnd one the wife that lay by thee.\nBrother, brother, on some far shore [Antistrophe 1.\nHast thou a city, is there a door\nThat knows thy footfall, Wandering One?\nWho left me, left me, when all our pain\nWas bitter about us, a father slain,\nAnd a girl that wept in her room alone.\nThou couldst break me this bondage sore,\nOnly thou, who art far away,\nLoose our father, and wake once more….\nZeus, Zeus, dost hear me pray?…\nThe sleeping blood and the shame and the doom!\nO feet that rest not, over the foam\nOf distant seas, come home, come home!\nWhat boots this cruse that I carry? [Strophe 2.\nO, set free my brow!\nFor the gathered tears that tarry\nThrough the day and the dark till now,\nNow in the dawn are free,\nFather, and flow beneath\nThe floor of the world, to be\nAs a song in she house of Death:\nFrom the rising up of the day\nThey guide my heart alway,\nThe silent tears unshed,\nAnd my body mourns for the dead;\nMy cheeks bleed silently,\nAnd these bruised temples keep\nTheir pain, remembering thee\nAnd thy bloody sleep.\nBe rent, O hair of mine head!\nAs a swan crying alone\nWhere the river windeth cold,\nFor a loved, for a silent one,\nWhom the toils of the fowler hold,\nI cry, Father, to thee,\nO slain in misery!\nThe water, the wan water, [Antistrophe 2.\nLapped him, and his head\nDrooped in the bed of slaughter\nLow, as one wearièd;\nWoe for the edgèd axe,\nAnd woe for the heart of hate,\nHoundlike about thy tracks,\nO conqueror desolate,\nFrom Troy over land and sea,\nTill a wife stood waiting thee;\nNot with crowns did she stand,\nNor flowers of peace in her hand;\nWith Aegisthus' dagger drawn\nFor her hire she strove,\nThrough shame and through blood alone;\nAnd won her a traitor's love.\n[As she ceases there enter from right and left the CHORUS, consisting of women of Argos, young and old, in festal dress.\nCHORUS.\nSome Women.\nChild of the mighty dead, [Strophe.\nElectra, lo, my way\nTo thee in the dawn hath sped,\nAnd the cot on the mountain grey,\nFor the Watcher hath cried this day:\nHe of the ancient folk,\nThe walker of waste and hill,\nWho drinketh the milk of the flock;\nAnd he told of Hera's will;\nFor the morrow's morrow now\nThey cry her festival,\nAnd before her throne shall bow\nOur damsels all.\nELECTRA.\nNot unto joy, nor sweet\nMusic, nor shining of gold,\nThe wings of my spirit beat.\nLet the brides of Argos hold\nTheir dance in the night, as of old;\nI lead no dance; I mark\nNo beat as the dancers sway;\nWith tears I dwell in the dark,\nAnd my thought is of tears alway,\nTo the going down of the day.\nLook on my wasted hair\nAnd raiment….

No more of wailing! Women, flee!\nStrange armèd men beside the dwelling there\nLie ambushed! They are rising from their lair.\nBack by the road, all you. I will essay\nThe house; and may our good feet save us!\nORESTES (between ELECTRA and the hut).\nStay,\nUnhappy woman! Never fear my steel.\nELECTRA (in utter panic).\nO bright Apollo! Mercy! See, I kneel;\nSlay me not.\nORESTES.\nOthers I have yet to slay\nLess dear than thou.\nELECTRA.\nGo from me!

But speak,\nTell of thy life, that I may know, and seek\nThy brother with a tale that must be heard\nHowe'er it sicken. If mine eyes be blurred,\nRemember, 'tis the fool that feels not. Aye,\nWisdom is full of pity; and thereby\nMen pay for too much wisdom with much pain.\nLEADER.\nMy heart is moved as this man's. I would fain\nLearn all thy tale. Here dwelling on the hills\nLittle I know of Argos and its ills.\nELECTRA.\nIf I must speak—and at love's call, God knows,\nI fear not—I will tell thee all; my woes,\nMy father's woes, and—O, since thou hast stirred\nThis storm of speech, thou bear him this my word—\nHis woes and shame! Tell of this narrow cloak\nIn the wind; this grime and reek of toil, that choke\nMy breathing; this low roof that bows my head\nAfter a king's. This raiment … thread by thread,\n'Tis I must weave it, or go bare—must bring,\nMyself, each jar of water from the spring.\nNo holy day for me, no festival,\nNo dance upon the green! From all, from all\nI am cut off. No portion hath my life\n'Mid wives of Argos, being no true wife.\nNo portion where the maidens throng to praise\nCastor—my Castor, whom in ancient days,\nEre he passed from us and men worshipped him,\nThey named my bridegroom!—\nAnd she, she!… The grim\nTroy spoils gleam round her throne, and by each hand\nQueens of the East, my father's prisoners, stand,\nA cloud of Orient webs and tangling gold.\nAnd there upon the floor, the blood, the old\nBlack blood, yet crawls and cankers, like a rot\nIn the stone! And on our father's chariot\nThe murderer's foot stands glorying, and the red\nFalse hand uplifts that ancient staff, that led\nThe armies of the world!… Aye, tell him how\nThe grave of Agamemnon, even now,\nLacketh the common honour of the dead;\nA desert barrow, where no tears are shed,\nNo tresses hung, no gift, no myrtle spray.\nAnd when the wine is in him, so men say,\nOur mother's mighty master leaps thereon,\nSpurning the slab, or pelteth stone on stone,\nFlouting the lone dead and the twain that live:\n'Where is thy son Orestes? Doth he give\nThy tomb good tendance? Or is all forgot?'\nSo is he scorned because he cometh not….\nO Stranger, on my knees, I charge thee, tell\nThis tale, not mine, but of dumb wrongs that swell\nCrowding—and I the trumpet of their pain,\nThis tongue, these arms, this bitter burning brain;\nThese dead shorn locks, and he for whom they died!\nHis father slew Troy's thousands in their pride;\nHe hath but one to kill…. O God, but one!\nIs he a man, and Agamemnon's son?\nLEADER.\nBut hold: is this thy husband from the plain,\nHis labour ended, hasting home again?\nEnter the PEASANT.\nPEASANT.\nHa, who be these? Strange men in arms before\nMy house! What would they at this lonely door?\nSeek they for me?—Strange gallants should not stay\nA woman's goings.\nELECTRA.\nFriend and helper!—Nay,\nThink not of any evil. These men be\nFriends of Orestes, charged with words for me!…\nStrangers, forgive his speech.\nPEASANT.\nWhat word have they\nOf him? At least he lives and sees the day!\nELECTRA.\nSo fares their tale—and sure I doubt it not!\nPEASANT.\nAnd ye two still are living in his thought,\nThou and his father?\nELECTRA.\nIn his dreams we live.\nAn exile hath small power.\nPEASANT.\nAnd did he give\nSome privy message?\nELECTRA.\nNone: they come as spies\nFor news of me.\nPEASANT.\nThine outward news their eyes\nCan see; the rest, methinks, thyself will tell.\nELECTRA.\nThey have seen all, heard all. I trust them well.\nPEASANT.\nWhy were our doors not open long ago?—\nBe welcome, strangers both, and pass below\nMy lintel. In return for your glad words\nBe sure all greeting that mine house affords\nIs yours.—Ye followers, bear in their gear!—\nGainsay me not; for his sake are ye dear\nThat sent you to our house; and though my part\nIn life be low, I am no churl at heart.\n[The PEASANT goes to the ARMED SERVANTS at the back, to help them with the baggage.\nORESTES (aside to ELECTRA).\nIs this the man that shields thy maidenhood\nUnknown, and will not wrong thy father's blood?\nELECTRA.\nHe is called my husband. 'Tis for him I toil.\nORESTES.\nHow dark lies honour hid! And what turmoil\nIn all things human: sons of mighty men\nFallen to naught, and from ill seed again\nGood fruit: yea, famine in the rich man's scroll\nWrit deep, and in poor flesh a lordly soul.\nAs, lo, this man, not great in Argos, not\nWith pride of house uplifted, in a lot\nOf unmarked life hath shown a prince's grace.\n[To the PEASANT, who has returned.\nAll that is here of Agamemnon's race,\nAnd all that lacketh yet, for whom we come,\nDo thank thee, and the welcome of thy home\nAccept with gladness.—Ho, men; hasten ye\nWithin!—This open-hearted poverty\nIs blither to my sense than feasts of gold.\nLady, thine husband's welcome makes me bold;\nYet would thou hadst thy brother, before all\nConfessed, to greet us in a prince's hall!\nWhich may be, even yet. Apollo spake\nThe word; and surely, though small store I make\nOf man's divining, God will fail us not.\n[ORESTES and PYLADES go in, following the SERVANTS.\nLEADER.\nO never was the heart of hope so hot\nWithin me. How? So moveless in time past,\nHath Fortune girded up her loins at last?\nELECTRA.\nNow know'st thou not thine own ill furniture,\nTo bid these strangers in, to whom for sure\nOur best were hardship, men of gentle breed?\nPEASANT.\nNay, if the men be gentle, as indeed\nI deem them, they will take good cheer or ill\nWith even kindness.\nELECTRA.\n'Twas ill done; but still—\nGo, since so poor thou art, to that old friend\nWho reared my father. At the realm's last end\nHe dwells, where Tanaos river foams between\nArgos and Sparta. Long time hath he been\nAn exile 'mid his flocks. Tell him what thing\nHath chanced on me, and bid him haste and bring\nMeat for the strangers' tending.—Glad, I trow,\nThat old man's heart will be, and many a vow\nWill lift to God, to learn the child he stole\nFrom death, yet breathes.—I will not ask a dole\nFrom home; how should my mother help me? Nay,\nI pity him that seeks that door, to say\nOrestes liveth!\nPEASANT.\nWilt thou have it so?\nI will take word to the old man. But go\nQuickly within, and whatso there thou find\nSet out for them.

In a set\nGarden beside a channelled rivulet,\nCulling a myrtle garland for his brow,\nHe walked: but hailed us as we passed: 'How now,\nStrangers! Who are ye? Of what city sprung,\nAnd whither bound?' 'Thessalians,' answered young\nOrestes: 'to Alpheüs journeying,\nWith gifts to Olympian Zeus.' Whereat the king:\n'This while, beseech you, tarry, and make full\nThe feast upon my hearth. We slay a bull\nHere to the Nymphs. Set forth at break of day\nTo-morrow, and 'twill cost you no delay.\nBut come'—and so he gave his hand, and led\nThe two men in—'I must not be gainsaid;\nCome to the house. Ho, there; set close at hand\nVats of pure water, that the guests may stand\nAt the altar's verge, where falls the holy spray.'\nThen quickly spake Orestes: 'By the way\nWe cleansed us in a torrent stream. We need\nNo purifying here. But if indeed\nStrangers may share thy worship, here are we\nReady, O King, and swift to follow thee.'\nSo spoke they in the midst. And every thrall\nLaid down the spears they served the King withal,\nAnd hied him to the work. Some bore amain\nThe death-vat, some the corbs of hallowed grain;\nOr kindled fire, and round the fire and in\nSet cauldrons foaming; and a festal din\nFilled all the place. Then took thy mother's lord\nThe ritual grains, and o'er the altar poured\nIts due, and prayed: 'O Nymphs of Rock and Mere,\nWith many a sacrifice for many a year,\nMay I and she who waits at home for me,\nMy Tyndarid Queen, adore you. May it be\nPeace with us always, even as now; and all\nIll to mine enemies'—meaning withal\nThee and Orestes. Then my master prayed\nAgainst that prayer, but silently, and said\nNo word, to win once more his fatherland.\nThen in the corb Aegisthus set his hand,\nTook the straight blade, cut from the proud bull's head\nA lock, and laid it where the fire was red;\nThen, while the young men held the bull on high,\nSlew it with one clean gash; and suddenly\nTurned on thy brother: 'Stranger, every true\nThessalian, so the story goes, can hew\nA bull's limbs clean, and tame a mountain steed.\nTake up the steel, and show us if indeed\nRumour speak true,' Right swift Orestes took\nThe Dorian blade, back from his shoulders shook\nHis broochèd mantle, called on Pylades\nTo aid him, and waved back the thralls. With ease\nHeelwise he held the bull, and with one glide\nBared the white limb; then stripped the mighty hide\nFrom off him, swifter than a runner runs\nHis furlongs, and laid clean the flank. At once\nAegisthus stooped, and lifted up with care\nThe ominous parts, and gazed. No lobe was there;\nBut lo, strange caves of gall, and, darkly raised,\nThe portal vein boded to him that gazed\nFell visitations. Dark as night his brow\nClouded. Then spake Orestes: 'Why art thou\nCast down so sudden?' 'Guest,' he cried, 'there be\nTreasons from whence I know not, seeking me.\nOf all my foes, 'tis Agamemnon's son;\nHis hate is on my house, like war.' 'Have done!'\nOrestes cried: 'thou fear'st an exile's plot,\nLord of a city? Make thy cold heart hot\nWith meat.—Ho, fling me a Thessalian steel!\nThis Dorian is too light. I will unseal\nThe breast of him.' He took the heavier blade,\nAnd clave the bone. And there Aegisthus stayed,\nThe omens in his hand, dividing slow\nThis sign from that; till, while his head bent low,\nUp with a leap thy brother flashed the sword,\nThen down upon his neck, and cleft the cord\nOf brain and spine. Shuddering the body stood\nOne instant in an agony of blood,\nAnd gasped and fell. The henchmen saw, and straight\nFlew to their spears, a host of them to set\nAgainst those twain. But there the twain did stand\nUnfaltering, each his iron in his hand,\nEdge fronting edge. Till 'Hold,' Orestes calls:\n'I come not as in wrath against these walls\nAnd mine own people. One man righteously\nI have slain, who slew my father. It is I,\nThe wronged Orestes! Hold, and smite me not,\nOld housefolk of my father!' When they caught\nThat name, their lances fell. And one old man,\nAn ancient in the house, drew nigh to scan\nHis face, and knew him. Then with one accord\nThey crowned thy brother's temples, and outpoured\njoy and loud songs. And hither now he fares\nTo show the head, no Gorgon, that he bears,\nBut that Aegisthus whom thou hatest! Yea,\nBlood against blood, his debt is paid this day.\n[He goes off to meet the others—ELECTRA stands as though stupefied.\nCHORUS.\nNow, now thou shalt dance in our dances,\nBeloved, as a fawn in the night!\nThe wind is astir for the glances\nOf thy feet; thou art robed with delight.\nHe hath conquered, he cometh to free us\nWith garlands new-won,\nMore high than the crowns of Alpheüs,\nThine own father's son:\nCry, cry, for the day that is won!\nELECTRA.\nO Light of the Sun, O chariot wheels of flame,\nO Earth and Night, dead Night without a name\nThat held me!

Had it been\nTo save some falling city, leaguered in\nWith foemen; to prop up our castle towers,\nAnd rescue other children that were ours,\nGiving one life for many, by God's laws\nI had forgiven all! Not so. Because\nHelen was wanton, and her master knew\nNo curb for her: for that, for that, he slew\nMy daughter!—Even then, with all my wrong,\nNo wild beast yet was in me. Nay, for long,\nI never would have killed him. But he came,\nAt last, bringing that damsel, with the flame\nOf God about her, mad and knowing all:\nAnd set her in my room; and in one wall\nWould hold two queens!—O wild are woman's eyes\nAnd hot her heart. I say not otherwise.\nBut, being thus wild, if then her master stray\nTo love far off, and cast his own away,\nShall not her will break prison too, and wend\nSomewhere to win some other for a friend?\nAnd then on us the world's curse waxes strong\nIn righteousness! The lords of all the wrong\nMust hear no curse!—I slew him. I trod then\nThe only road: which led me to the men\nHe hated.

I will but pleasure thee.\nELECTRA.\nI answer then. And, mother, this shall be\nMy prayer of opening, where hangs the whole:\nWould God that He had made thee clean of soul!\nHelen and thou—O, face and form were fair,\nMeet for men's praise; but sisters twain ye were,\nBoth things of naught, a stain on Castor's star,\nAnd Helen slew her honour, borne afar\nIn wilful ravishment: but thou didst slay\nThe highest man of the world. And now wilt say\n'Twas wrought in justice for thy child laid low\nAt Aulis?… Ah, who knows thee as I know?\nThou, thou, who long ere aught of ill was done\nThy child, when Agamemnon scarce was gone,\nSate at the looking-glass, and tress by tress\nDidst comb the twined gold in loneliness.\nWhen any wife, her lord being far away.\nToils to be fair, O blot her out that day\nAs false within! What would she with a cheek\nSo bright in strange men's eyes, unless she seek\nSome treason? None but I, thy child, could so\nWatch thee in Hellas: none but I could know\nThy face of gladness when our enemies\nWere strong, and the swift cloud upon thine eyes\nIf Troy seemed falling, all thy soul keen-set\nPraying that he might come no more!… And yet\nIt was so easy to be true. A king\nWas thine, not feebler, not in anything\nBelow Aegisthus; one whom Hellas chose\nFor chief beyond all kings. Aye, and God knows,\nHow sweet a name in Greece, after the sin\nThy sister wrought, lay in thy ways to win.\nIll deeds make fair ones shine, and turn thereto\nMen's eyes.—Enough: but say he wronged thee; slew\nBy craft thy child:—what wrong had I done, what\nThe babe Orestes? Why didst render not\nBack unto us, the children of the dead,\nOur father's portion? Must thou heap thy bed\nWith gold of murdered men, to buy to thee\nThy strange man's arms? Justice!

See Elmsley on vss. 49 and 474.\nTHE ARGUMENT.\nIolaus, son of Iphiclus, and nephew of Hercules, whom he had joined in his expeditions during his youth, in his old age protected his sons. For the sons of Hercules having been driven out of every part of Greece by Eurystheus, he came with them to Athens; and, embracing the altars of the Gods, was safe, Demophoon being king of the city; and when Copreus, the herald of Eurystheus, wished to remove the suppliants, he prevented him. Upon this he departed, threatening war. Demophoon despised him; but hearing the oracles promise him victory if he sacrificed the most noble Athenian virgin to Ceres, he was grieved; not wishing to slay either his own daughter, or that of any citizen, for the sake of the suppliants. But Macaria, one of the daughters of Hercules, hearing of the prediction, willingly devoted herself. They honored her for her noble death, and, knowing that their enemies were at hand, went forth to battle. The play ends with their victory, and the capture of Eurystheus.\nTHE HERACLIDÆ.\nIOLAUS.\nThis has long since been my established opinion, the just man is born for his neighbors; but he who has a mind bent upon gain is both useless to the city and disagreeable to deal with, but best for himself. And I know this, not having learned it by word of mouth; for I, through shame, and reverencing the ties of kindred, when it was in my power to dwell quietly in Argos, partook of more of Hercules' labors, while he was with us, than any one man besides:[1] and now that he dwells in heaven, keeping these his children under my wings, I preserve them, I myself being in want of safety. For since their father was removed from the earth, first Eurystheus wished to kill me, but I escaped; and my country indeed is no more, but my life is saved, and I wander in exile, migrating from one city to another. For, in addition to my other ills, Eurystheus has chosen to insult me with this insult; sending heralds whenever on earth he learns we are settled, he demands us, and drives us out of the land; alleging the city of Argos, one not paltry either to be friends with or to make an enemy, and himself too prospering as he is; but they seeing my weak state, and that these too are little, and bereaved of their sire, respecting the more powerful, drive us from the land. And I am banished, together with the banished children, and fare ill together with those who fare ill, loathing to desert them, lest some may say thus, Behold, now that the children have no father, Iolaus, their kinsman born, defends them not. But being bereft of all Greece, coming to Marathon and the country under the same rule, we sit suppliants at the altars of the Gods, that they may assist us; for it is said that the two sons of Theseus inhabit the territory of this land, of the race of Pandion, having received it by lot, being near akin to these children; on which account we have come this way to the frontiers of illustrious Athens. And by two aged people is this flight led, I, indeed, being alarmed about these children; and the female race of her son Alcmena preserves within this temple, clasping it in her arms; for we are ashamed that virgins should mingle with the mob, and stand at the altars. But Hyllus and his brothers, who are older, are seeking where there is a strong-hold that we may inhabit, if we be thrust forth from this land by force. O children, children! hither; take hold of my garments; I see the herald of Eurystheus coming hither toward us, by whom we are pursued as wanderers, deprived of every land.[2] O detested one, may you perish, and the man who sent you: how many evils indeed have you announced to the noble father of these children from that same mouth!\nCOPREUS. I suppose you think that this is a fine seat you are sitting in, and have come to a city which is an ally, thinking foolishly; for there is no one who will choose your useless power in preference to Eurystheus. Depart; why toilest thou thus? You must rise up and go to Argos, where punishment by stoning awaits you.\nIOL. Not so, since the altar of the God will aid me, and the free land in which we tread.\nCOP. Do you wish to cause me trouble with this band?\nIOL. Surely you will not drag me away, nor these children, seizing by force?\nCOP. You shall know; but you are not a good prophet in this.\nIOL. This shall never happen, while I am alive.\nCOP. Depart; but I will lead these away, even though you be unwilling, considering them, wherever they may be, to belong to Eurystheus.\nIOL. O ye who have dwelt in Athens a long time, defend us; for, being suppliants of Jove, the Presider over the Forum,[3] we are treated with violence, and our garlands are profaned, both a reproach to the city, and an insult to the Gods.\nCHORUS. Hollo! hollo! what is this noise near the altar? what calamity will it straightway portend?\nIOL. Behold me, a weak old man, thrown down on the plain; miserable that I am.\nCHOR. By whose hand do you fall this unhappy fall?\n* * * *\nIOL. This man, O strangers, dishonoring your Gods, drags me violently from the altar of Jupiter.\nCHOR. From what land, O old man, have you come hither to this people dwelling together in four cities?[4] or, have you come hither from across [the sea] with marine oar, having quitted the Eubœan shore?\nIOL. O strangers, I am not accustomed to an islander's life, but we are come to your land from Mycenæ.\nCHOR. What name, O old man, did the Mycenæan people call you?\nIOL. Know that I am lolaus, once the companion of Hercules; for this body is not unrenowned.\nCHOR. I know, having heard of it before; but say whose youthful children you are leading in your hand.\nIOL. These, O strangers, are the sons of Hercules, who are come as suppliants of you and the city.\nCHOR. What do ye seek? or, tell me, is it wanting to have speech of the city?\nIOL. Not to be given up, and not to go to Argos, being dragged from your Gods by force.\nCOP. But this will not be sufficient for your masters, who, having power over you, find you here.\nCHOR. It is right, O stranger, to reverence the suppliants of the Gods, and not for you to leave by violent hands the habitations of the deities, for venerable Justice will not suffer this.\nCOP. Send now Eurystheus's subjects out of this land, and I will not use this hand violently.\nCHOR. It is impious for a state to reject the suppliant prayer of strangers.\nCOP. But it is good to have one's foot out of trouble, being possessed of the better counsel.\nCHOR. You should then have dared this, having spoken to the king of this land, but you should not drag strangers away from the Gods by force, if you respect a free land.\nCOP. But who is king of this country and city?\nCHOR. Demophoon, the son of Theseus, of a noble father.\nCOP. With him, then, the contest of this argument had best be; all else is spoken in vain.\nCHOR. And indeed hither he comes in haste, and Acamas, his brother, to hear these words.\nDEMOPHOON. Since you, being an old man, have anticipated us, who are younger, in running to this hearth of Jove, say what hap collects this multitude here.\nCHOR. These sons of Hercules sit here as suppliants, having crowned the altar, as you see. O king, and Iolaus, the faithful companion of their father.\nDE. Why then did this chance occasion clamors?\nCHOR. This man caused the noise, seeking to lead him by force from this hearth; and he tripped up the legs of the old man, so that I shed the tear for pity.\nDE. And indeed he has a Grecian robe and style of dress; but these are the doings of a barbarian hand; it is for you then to tell me, and not to delay, leaving the confines of what land you are come hither.\nCOP. I am an Argive; for this you wish to learn: and I am willing to say why, and from whom, I am come. Eurystheus, the king of Mycenæ, sends me hither to lead away these men; and I have come, O stranger, having many just things at once to do and to say; for I being an Argive myself, lead away Argives, having them as fugitives from my country condemned to die by the laws there; and we have the right, managing our city ourselves by ourselves, to fix our own punishments: but they having come to the hearths of many others also, there also we have taken our stand on these same arguments, and no one has dared to bring evils upon himself. But either perceiving some folly in you, they have come hither, or in perplexity running the risk, whether it shall be or not. For surely they do not think that you alone are mad, in so great a portion of Greece as they have been over, so as to commiserate their foolish distresses. Come, compare the two; admitting them into your land, and suffering us to lead them away, what will you gain? Such things as these you may gain from us; you may add to this city the whole power of Argos, and all the might of Eurystheus; but if looking to the words and pitiable condition of these men, you are softened by them, the matter comes to the contest of the spear; for think not that we will give up this contest without steel. What then will you say? deprived of what lands, making war with the Tirynthians and Argives, and repelling them, with what allies, and on whose behalf will you bury the dead that fall? Surely you will obtain an evil report among the citizens, if, for the sake of an old man, a mere tomb,[5] one who is nothing, as one may say, and of these children, you will put your foot into a mess;[6] you will say, at best, that you shall find, at least, hope; and this too is at present much wanting; for these who are armed would fight but ill with Argives if they were grown up, if this encourages your mind, and there is much time in the mean while in which ye may be destroyed; but be persuaded by me, giving nothing, but permitting me to lead away my own, gain Mycenæ. And do not (as you are wont to do) suffer this, when it is in your power to choose the better friends, choose the worse.\nCHOR. Who can decide what is right, or understand an argument, till he has clearly heard the statement of both?\nIOL. O king, this exists in thy city; I am permitted in turn to speak and to hear, and no one will reject me before that, as in other places; but with this man we have nothing to do; for since nothing of Argos is any longer ours, (it having been decreed by a vote,) but we are exiled our country, how can this man justly lead us away as Mycenæans, whom they have driven from the land? for we are strangers; or else you decide that whoever is banished Argos is banished the boundaries of the Greeks. Surely not from Athens; they will not, for fear of the Argives, drive out the children of Hercules from their land; for it is not Trachis, nor the Achæan city, from whence you, not by justice, but bragging about Argos; just as you now speak, drove these men, sitting at the altars as suppliants; for if this shall be, and they ratify your words, I no longer know this Athens as free. But I know their disposition and nature; they will rather die; for among virtuous men, disgrace is considered before life. Enough of the city; for indeed it is an invidious thing to praise it too much; and often I know myself I have been oppressed at being overpraised: but I wish to say to you that it is necessary for you to save these men, since you are ruler over this land. Pittheus was son of Pelops and Æthra, daughter of Pittheus, and your father Theseus was born of her. And again I trace for you their descent: Hercules was son of Jupiter and Alcmena, and she was the child of the daughter of Pelops; so your father and theirs must be fellow-cousins. Thus you, O Demophoon, are related to them by birth; and, besides this connection, I will tell you for what you are bound to requite the children. For I say, I formerly, when shield-bearer to their father, sailed with Theseus after the belt,[7] the cause of much slaughter, and from the murky recesses of hell did he bring forth your father. All Greece bears witness to this; for which things they beseech you to return a kindness, and that they may not be yielded up, nor be driven from this land, torn from your Gods by violence; for this would be disgraceful to you by yourself, and an evil to the city,[8] that suppliant relations, wanderers—alas for the misery! look on them, look—should be dragged away by force. But I beseech you, and offer you suppliant garlands, by your hands and your chin, do not dishonor the children of Hercules, having received them in your power; but be thou a relation to them, be a friend, father, brother, master; for all these things are better than [for them] to fall into the power of the Argives.\nCHOR. Hearing of these men's misfortunes, I pitied them, O king! and now particularly I have witnessed nobleness overcome by fortune; for these men, being sons of a noble father, are undeservedly unhappy.\nDE. Three ways of misfortune urge me, O Iolaus, not to reject these suppliants. The greatest, Jupiter, at whose altars you sit, having this procession of youths with you; and my relationship to them, and because I am bound of old that they should fare well at my hands, in gratitude to their father; and the disgrace,[9] which one ought exceedingly to regard. For if I permitted this altar to be violated by force by a strange man, I shall not seem to inhabit a free country. But I fear to betray my suppliants to the Argives; and this is nearly as bad as the noose. But I wish you had come with better fortune; but still, even now, fear not that any one shall drag you and these children by force from this altar. And do thou, going to Argos, both tell this to Eurystheus; and besides that, if he has any charge against these strangers, he shall meet with justice; but you shall never drag away these men.\nCOP. Not if it be just, and I prevail in argument?\nDE. And how can it be just to drag away a suppliant by force?\nCOP. This, then, is not disgraceful to me, but an injury to you.\nDE. To me indeed, if I allow you to drag them away.\nCOP. But do you depart, and then will I drag them thence.\nDE. You are stupid, thinking yourself wiser than a God.\nCOP. Hither it seems the wicked should fly.\nDE. The seat of the Gods is a common defense to all.\nCOP. Perhaps this will not seem good to the Mycenæans.\nDE. Am not I then master over those here?\nCOP. [Ay,] but not to injure them, if you are wise.\nDE. Are ye hurt, if I do not defile the Gods?\nCOP. I do not wish you to have war with the Argives.\nDE. I, too, am the same; but I will not let go of these men.\nCOP. At all events, taking possession of my own, I shall lead them away.\nDE. Then you will not easily depart back to Argos.\nCOP. I shall soon see that by experience.\nDE. You will touch them to your own injury, and that without delay.\nCHOR. For God's sake, venture not to strike a herald!\nDE. I will not, if the herald at least will learn to be wise.\nCHOR. Depart thou; and do not you touch him, O king!\nCOP. I go; for the struggle of a single hand is powerless. But I will come, bringing hither many a brazen spear of Argive war; and ten thousand shield-bearers await me, and Eurystheus, the king himself, as general. And he waits, expecting news from hence, on the extreme confines of Alcathus; and, having heard of your insolence, he will make himself too well known to you, and to the citizens, and to this land, and to the trees; for in vain should we have so much youth in Argos, if we did not chastise you.\nDE. Destruction on you! for I do not fear your Argos. But you are not likely, insulting me, to drag these men away from hence by force; for I possess this land, not being subject to that of Argos, but free.\nCHOR. It is time to provide, before the army of the Argives approaches the borders. And very impetuous is the Mars of the Mycenæans, and on this account more than before; for it is the habit of all heralds to tower up what is twice as much. What do you not think he will say to his princes about what terrible things he has suffered, and how within a little he was losing his life.\nIOL. There is not, to this man's children, a more glorious honor than to be sprung from a good and valiant father, and to marry from a good family; but I will not praise him who, overcome by desire, has mingled with the vulgar, to leave his children a reproach instead of pleasure; for noble birth wards off misfortune better than low descent; for we, having fallen into the extremity of evils, find these men friends and relations, who alone, in so large a country as Greece, have stood forward [on our behalf.] Give, O children, give them your right hand; and do ye give yours to the children, and draw near to them. O children, we have come to experience of our friends; and if you ever have a return to your country, and [again] possess the homes and honors of your father, always consider them your saviors and friends, and never lift the hostile spear against the land, remembering these things; but consider it the dearest city of all. And they are worthy that you should revere them, who have chosen to have so great a country and the Pelasgic people as enemies instead of us, though seeing us to be beggared wanderers; but still they have not given us up, nor driven us from their land. But I, living and dying, when I do die, with much praise, my friend, will extol you when I am in company with Theseus; and telling this, I will delight him, saying how well you received and aided the children of Hercules; and, being noble, you preserve through Greece your ancestral glory; and being born of noble parents, you are nowise inferior to your father, with but few others; for among many you may find perhaps but one who is not inferior to his father.[10]\nCHOR. This land is ever willing to aid in a just cause those in difficulty; therefore it has borne numberless toils for its friends, and now I see this contest at hand.\nDE. Thou hast spoken well; and I boast, old man, that their disposition is such that the kindness will be remembered. And I will make an assembly of the citizens, and draw them up so as to receive the army of the Mycenæans with a large force. First, I will send spies toward it, that it may not fall upon me by surprise: for in Argos every warrior is eager to run to assistance. And having collected the soothsayers, I will sacrifice. And do you go to my palace with the children, leaving the hearth of Jove, for there are those who, even if I be from home, will take care of you; go then, old man, to my palace.\nIOL. I will not leave the altar; but we will sit here, as suppliants, waiting till the city is successful; and when you are well freed from this contest, we will go to thy palace. But we have Gods as allies not inferior to those of the Argives, O king; for Juno, the wife of Jove, is their champion, but Minerva ours; and I say that this also tends to success, to have the best Gods, for Pallas will not endure to be conquered.\nCHOR. If thou boastest greatly, others do not therefore care for thee the more, O stranger, coming from Argos; but with thy big words thou wilt not terrify my mind: may it not be so to the mighty Athens, with the beauteous dances. But both thou art foolish, the son of Sthenelus, king in Argos, who, coming to another city not less than Argos, being a stranger, seek by violence to lead away wanderers, suppliants of the Gods, and claiming the protection of my land, not yielding to our kings, nor saying any thing else that is just. How can this be thought well among the wise? Peace indeed pleases me; but, O foolish king, I tell thee, if thou comest to this city, thou wilt not thus obtain what thou thinkest for. You are not the only one who has a spear and a brazen shield; but, O lover of war, mayest thou not with the spear disturb my city dear to the Graces; but restrain thyself.\nIOL. O my son, why comest thou, bringing solicitude to my eyes? Hast thou any news of the enemy? Do they delay, or are they at hand I or what do you hear? for I fear the word of the herald will in no wise be false, for their leader will come, having been fortunate in previous affairs, I clearly know, and with no moderate pride, against Athens; but Jove is the chastiser of over-arrogant thoughts.[11]\nDE. The army of the Argives is coming, and Eurystheus the king. I have seen it myself;[12] for it behooves a man who says he knows well the duty of a general not to reconnoitre the enemy by means of messengers. He has not then, as yet, let loose his army on these plains, but, sitting on a lofty crag, he reconnoitres (I should tell thee this as a conjecture) to see by which way he shall now lead his expedition, and place it in a safe station in this land; and my preparations are already well arranged, and the city is in arms, and the victims stand ready for those Gods to whom they ought to be slain offered; and the city, by means of soothsayers, is preparing by sacrifices flight for the enemy and safety for the city.[13] And having collected together all the bards who proclaim oracles, I have tested the ancient oracles, both public and concealed, which might save this land; and in their other counsels many things are different; but one opinion of all is conspicuously the same, they command me to sacrifice to the daughter of Ceres a damsel who is of a noble father.[14] And I have indeed, as you see, such great good-will toward you, but I will neither slay my own child[15] nor compel any other of my citizens to do so unwillingly; and who is so mad of his own accord, as to give out of his hands his dearest children? And now you may see bitter meetings; some saying that it is right to aid foreign suppliants, and some blaming my folly; and if I do this, a civil war is at once prepared. This, then, do you consider, and devise how both you yourselves may be saved and this land, and I be not brought into ill odor with the citizens; for I have not absolute sovereignty, as over barbarians; but if I do just things, I shall receive just things.\nCHOR. But does not the Goddess allow this city, although eager, to aid strangers?\nIOL. O children, we are like sailors, who, fleeing from the fierce rage of the storm, have come close to land, and then, again, by gales from the land, have been driven again out to sea; thus also shall we be driven from this land, being already on shore, as if saved. Alas! why, O wretched hope, did you then delight me, not being about to perfect my joy? For his thoughts, in truth, are to be pardoned if he is not willing to slay the children of his citizens; and I acquiesce in their conduct here, if the Gods decree that I shall fare thus. My gratitude to you shall never perish. O children, I know not what to do with you: whither shall we turn? for who of the Gods has been uncrowned by us? and what bulwark of land have we not approachedl? We shall perish, my children, we shall be given up; and for myself I care nothing if it behooves me to die, except that, dying, I shall gratify my enemies; but I weep for and pity you, O children, and Alcmena, the aged mother of your father; O! unhappy art thou, because of thy long life; and miserable am I, having labored much in vain. It was our fate then, our fate, falling into the hands of an enemy, to leave life disgracefully and miserably. But do you know in what you may aid me? for all hope of their safety has not deserted me. Give me up to the Argives instead of them, O king, and so neither run any risk yourself, and let the children be saved for me; I must not love my own life, let it go; and above all, Eurystheus would like taking me, the ally of Hercules, to insult me; for he is a froward man; and the wise should pray to have enmity with a wise man, not with an ignorant disposition, for in that case one, even if unfortunate, may meet with much respect.\nCHOR. O old man, do not now blame the city, perhaps it might be a gain to us; but still it would be an evil reproach that we betrayed strangers,\nDE. You have spoken things noble indeed, but impossible; the king does not lead his army hither wanting you; for what profit were it to Eurystheus for an old man to die? but he wishes to slay these children; for noble youths, who remember their fathers' injuries, springing up, are terrible to enemies; all which he must needs foresee; but if you know any other more seasonable counsel, prepare it, since I am perplexed and full of fear, having heard the oracle.\nMACARIA. O strangers, do not impute boldness to me because of my advances,[16] this I will beg first; for silence and modesty are best for a woman, and to remain quietly in-doors; but, having heard your lamentations, O Iolaus, I have come forth, not being commissioned to act as embassador for my race, but I am in some wise fit to do so; but chiefly do I care for these, my brothers: concerning myself I wish to ask whether, besides our former evils, any additional distress gnaws your mind?\nIOL. O daughter, it is not a new thing that I justly have to praise you most of the children of Hercules; but our house having appeared to us to progress well, has again changed to perplexity, for this man says, that the deliverers of oracles order us to sacrifice not a bull or a heifer, but a virgin, who is of a noble father, if we and this city would exist. About this then we are perplexed, for this man says he will neither slay his own children nor those of any one else; and to me he says, not plainly indeed, but somehow or other, unless I can devise any remedy for this, that we must find some other land, but he himself wishes to preserve this country.\nMAC. On this condition can we then be saved?\nIOL. On this, being fortunate in other respects.\nMAC. Fear not then any longer the hostile spear of the Argives; for I myself, old man, before I am commanded, am prepared to die, and to stand for slaughter; for what shall we say if the city thinks fit for our sakes to encounter a great danger, but we putting toils on others, avoid death when we can be saved? Not so, since this would be ridiculous for suppliants sitting at the shrines of the Gods to mourn, but being of such a sire as we are, to be seen to be cowards; how can this seem good! it were more noble, I think, (which may it never happen!) to fall into the hands of the enemy, this city being taken, and afterward, being born of a noble father, having suffered dreadful things, to see Hades none the less; but shall I wander about, driven from this land, and shall I not indeed be ashamed if any one says, 'Why have ye come hither with your suppliant branches, yourselves being too fond of life! Depart from the land, for we will not aid cowards.' But neither, indeed, if these die, and I myself am saved, have I any hope to fare well; for before now many have in this way betrayed their friends. For who would choose to have me, a solitary damsel, for his wife, or to raise children from me? therefore it is better to die than to have such an unworthy fate as this; and this may even be more seemly for some other, who is not illustrious as I. Lead me then where this body must needs die, and crown me and begin the rites, if you think fit, and conquer your enemies; for this life is ready for you, willing, and not unwilling; and I promise to die for these my brethren, and for myself; for not caring for life, I have found this most glorious thing to find, namely, to leave life gloriously.\nCHOR. Alas! alas! what shall I say, hearing this noble speech of the maiden who is willing to die on behalf of her brothers? Who can utter more noble words than these I who of men can do [a greater deed?][17]\nIOL. My child, your head comes from no other source, but thou, the seed of a divine mind, art sprung from Hercules.[18] I am not ashamed at your words, but I am grieved for your fortune; but how it may be more justly done, I will say: we must call hither all her sisters, and then let her who draws the lot die for her family; but it is not right for thee to die without casting lots.\nMAC. I will not die, obtaining the lot by chance, for then there are no thanks [to me;]—speak it not, old man; but if you accept me, and are willing to use me willing, I readily give up my life to them, but not, being compelled.\nIOL. Alas! this word of thine is again nobler than the former, and that other was most excellent; but you surpass daring by daring, and [good] words by good words. I do not bid you, nor do I forbid you, to die, my child; but you will benefit your brothers by dying.\nMAC. Thou biddest wisely; fear not to partake of my pollution, but I shall die freely. But follow me, O old man; for I wish to die by your hand; and do you, being present, wrap my body in my garments, since I am going to the terror of sacrifice, because I am born of the father of whom I boast to be.\nIOL. I could not be present at your death.\nMAC. At least, then, entreat of him that I may die, not by the hands of men, but of women.\nCHOR. It shall be so, O hapless virgin; since it were disgraceful to me too not to deck thee honorably on many accounts; both for your valiant spirit, and for justice' sake: but you are the most unhappy of all women that I have beheld with mine eyes; but, if thou wilt, depart, bespeaking a last address to these and to the old man.\nMAC. Farewell, old man, farewell; and train up for me these children to be such as thyself, wise in all respects, nothing more, for they will suffice; and endeavor to save them, not being over-willing to die. We are your children; by your hands we were brought up, and behold see me yielding up my nuptial hour, dying for them. And ye, my company of brothers now present, may ye be happy, and may every thing be yours, for the sake of which my soul is sacrificed; and honor the old man, and the old woman in the house, Alcmena, the mother of my father, and these strangers. And if a release from troubles, and a return should ever be found for you through the Gods, remember to bury her who saves you, as is fitting; most honorably were just, for I was not wanting to you, but died for my race. This is my heir-loom instead of children and virginity, if indeed there be aught under the earth. May there indeed be nothing; for if we, mortals who die, are to have cares even there, I know not where one can turn, for to die is considered the greatest remedy for evils.\nIOL. But, O you, who mightily surpass all women in courage, know that, both living and dying, you shall be most honored by us: and farewell; for I abhor to speak words of ill omen about the Goddess to whom your body is given as the first-fruits, the daughter of Ceres. O children, we are undone; my limbs are relaxed by grief; take me, and place me in my seat, veiling me there with these garments, O children; since neither am I pleased at these things which are done, and if the oracle were not fulfilled, life would be unbearable, for the ruin would be greater; but even this is a calamity.\nCHOR. I say that no man is either happy or miserable but through the Gods, and that the same family does not always walk in good fortune, but different fates pursue it different ways; it is wont to make one from a lofty station insignificant, and makes the wanderer wealthy: but it is impossible to avoid what is fated; no one can repel it by wisdom, but he who is hasty without purpose will always have trouble; but do not thus bear the fortune sent by the Gods, falling down [in prayer,] and do not over-pain your mind with grief, for she hapless possesses a glorious portion of death on behalf of her brethren and her country; nor will an inglorious reputation among men await her: but virtue proceeds through toils. These things are worthy of her father, and worthy of her noble descent; and if you respect the deaths of the good, I share your feelings.\nSERVANT. O children, hail! But at what distance from this place is the aged Iolaus and your father's mother?\nIOL. We are here, such a presence as mine is.\nSERV. On what account dost thou lie thus, and have an eye so downcast?\nIOL. A domestic care has come upon me, by which I am constrained.\nSERV. Raise now thyself, erect thy head.\nIOL. I am an old man, and by no means strong.\nSERV. But I am come, bearing to you a great joy.\nIOL. And who art thou, where having met you, do I forget you?\nSERV. I am a poor servant of Hyllus; do you not recognize me, seeing me?\nIOL. O dearest one, dost thou then come as a savior to us from injury?\nSERV. Surely; and moreover you are prosperous as to the present state of affairs.\nIOL. O mother of a doughty son, I mean Alcmena, come forth, hear these most welcome words; for you have been long wasting away as to your soul in anxiety concerning those who have come hither, where they would ever arrive.[19]\nALCMENA. Wherefore has a mighty shout filled all this house? O Iolaus, does any herald, coming from Argos, again do you violence? my strength indeed is weak, but thus much you must know, O stranger, you shall never drag these away while I am living, else may I no longer be thought to be his mother; but if you touch them with your hand, you will have no honorable contest with two old people.\nIOL. Be of good cheer, old woman; fear not, the herald is not come from Argos bearing hostile words.\nALC. Why then did you raise a shout, a messenger of fear?\nIOL. To you, that you should approach near before this temple.\nALC. I do not understand this; for who is this man?\nIOL. He announces that your son's son is come.\nALC. O! hail thou also for this news; but why and where[20] is he now absent putting his foot in this country? what calamity prevents him from appearing hither with you, and delighting my mind?\nSERV. He is stationing and marshaling the army which he has come bringing.\nALC. I no longer understand this speech.\nIOL. I do; but it is my business to inquire about this.\nSERV. What then of what has been done do you wish to learn?\nIOL. With how great a multitude of allies is he come?\nSERV. With many; but I can say no other number.\nIOL. The chiefs of the Athenians know, I suppose.\nSERV. They do; and they occupy the left wing.[21]\nIOL. Is then the army already armed as for the work?\nSERV. Ay; and already the victims are led away from the ranks.\nIOL. And how far distant is the Argive army?\nSERV. So that the general can be distinctly seen.\nIOL. Doing what? arraying the ranks of the enemies?\nSERV. We conjectured this, for we did not hear him; but I will go; I should not like my masters to join battle with the enemy, deserted as far as my part is concerned.\nIOL. And I will go with you; for we think the same things, being present to aid our friends as much as we can.\nSERV. It is not your part to say a foolish word.\nIOL. And not to share the sturdy battle with my friends!\nSERV. One can not see a wound from an inactive hand.\nIOL. But what, can not I too strike through a shield?\nSERV. You might strike, but you yourself would fall first.\nIOL. No one of the enemy will dare to behold me.\nSERV. You have not, my good friend, the strength which once you had.\nIOL. But I will fight with them who will not be the fewer in numbers.\nSERV. You add but a slight weight to your friends.\nIOL. Do not detain me who am prepared to act.\nSERV. You are not able to do any thing, but you may perhaps be to advise.\nIOL. You may say the rest, as I not staying to hear.\nSERV. How then will you appear to the soldiers without arms?\nIOL. There are within this palace arms taken in war, which I will use and restore if alive; but the God will not demand them back of me, if I fall; but go in, and taking them down from the pegs, bring me as quickly as possible the panoply of a warrior; for this is a disgraceful house-keeping, for some to fight, and some to remain behind through fear.\nCHOR. Time does not depress your spirit, but it grows young again, but your body is weak: why dost thou toil in vain? which will harm you indeed, but profit our city but little; you should consider your age, and leave alone impossibilities, it can not be that you again should acquire youth.\nALC. Why are you, not being in your senses, about to leave me alone with my children?\nIOL. For valor is the part of men; but it is your duty to take care of them.\nALC. But what if you die? how shall I be saved?\nIOL. Your sons who are left will take care of your son.\nALC. But if they, which Heaven forbid, should meet with fate!\nIOL. These strangers will not betray you, do not fear.\nALC. Such confidence indeed I have, nothing else.\nIOL. And Jove, I well know, cares for your toils.\nALC. Alas! Jupiter shall never be reproached by me, but he himself knows whether he is just toward me.\nSERV. You see now this panoply of arms; but you can not make too much haste[22] in arraying your body in them, as the contest is at hand, and, above all things, Mars hates those who delay; but if you fear the weight of arms, now then go forth unarmed,[23] and in the ranks be clad with this equipment, and I will carry it so far.\nIOL. Thou hast said well; but bring the arms, having them close at hand, and put a spear in my hand, and support my left arm guiding my foot.\nSERV. Is it right to lead a warrior like a child?\nIOL. One must go safely for the sake of the omen.\nSERV. Would you were able to do as much as you are willing.\nIOL. Make haste, I shall suffer sadly if too late for the battle.\nSERV. It is you who delay, and not I, seeming to do something.\nIOL. Do you not see how my foot presses on?\nSERV. I see you rather seeming to hasten than hastening.\nIOL. You will not say so, when you behold me there.\nSERV. Doing what? I wish I may see you successful.\nIOL. Striking some of the enemy through the shield.\nSERV. If indeed we get there; for that I have fears of.\nIOL. Alas! O arm, would thou wert such an ally to me as I recollect you in your youth, when you ravaged Sparta with Hercules, how would I put Eurystheus to flight; since he is but a coward in abiding a spear. But in prosperity then is this too which is not right, a reputation for courage; for we think that he who is prosperous knows all things well.\nCHOR. O earth, and moon that shinest through the night, and most brilliant rays of the God, that gave light to mortals, bring me news, and shout in heaven and at the queenly throne of the blue-eyed Minerva. I am about, on behalf of my country, on behalf of my house, having received suppliants I am about to cut through danger with the white steel. It is terrible that a city, prosperous as Mycenæ, and much praised for valor in war, should nourish secret[24] anger against my land; but it is evil too, O city, if we are to give up strangers at the bidding of Argos.[25] Jupiter is my ally, I fear not; Jupiter rightly has favor toward me. Never shall the Gods seem inferior to men in my opinion.[26] But, O venerable Goddess, for the soil of this land is thine, and the city of which you are mother, mistress, and guardian, lead away by some other way him who unjustly leads on this spear-brandishing host from Argos; for as far as my virtue is concerned, I do not deserve to be banished from these halls. For honor, with much sacrifice, is ever offered to you; nor does the waning[27] day of the month forget you, nor the songs of youths, nor the measures of dances; but on the lofty hill shouts resound in accordance with the beatings of the feet of virgins the livelong night.\nSERV. O mistress, I bring news most concise for you to hear, and to myself most glorious; we have conquered our enemies, and trophies are set up bearing the panoply of your enemies.\nALC. O best beloved, this day has caused thee to be made free for this thy news; but from one disaster you do not yet free me, for I fear whether they be living to me whom I wish to be.\nSERV. They live, the most glorious in the army.\nALC. Does not the aged Iolaus survive?\nSERV. Surely, and having done most glorious deeds by help of the Gods.\nALC. But what? has he done any doughty act in the fight?\nSERV. He has changed from an old into a young man again.\nALC. Thou tellest marvelous things, but first I wish you to relate the prosperous contest of your friends in battle.\nSERV. One speech of mine shall tell you all this; for when stretching out [our ranks] face to face, we arrayed our armies against one another, Hyllus putting his foot out of his four-horse chariot, stood in the mid-space of the field;[28] and then said, O general, you are come from Argos, why leave we not this land alone? and you will do Mycenæ no harm, depriving it of one man; but you fighting alone with me alone, either killing me, lead away the children of Hercules, or dying, allow me to possess my ancestral prerogative and palaces. And the army gave praise; that the speech was well spoken for a termination of their toils, and in respect of courage. But he neither regarding those who had heard the speech, nor, although he was general, his [own character for] cowardice, ventured not to come near the warlike spear, but was most cowardly; and being such, he came to enslave the descendants of Hercules. Hyllus then returned again back to his ranks; but the soothsayers, when they saw that the affair could not be arranged by single combat of one shield, sacrificed, and delayed not, but let fall forth immediately the propitious slaughter of mortal throats; and some mounted chariots, and some concealed their sides under the sides of their shields; but the king of the Athenians gave to his army such orders as become a high-born man. 'O fellow-citizens, now it behooves one to defend the land that has produced and cherished us.'[29] And the other also besought his allies not to disgrace Argos and Mycenæ. But when the signal was sounded on a Tyrrhenian trumpet, and they joined battle with one another, what a clash of spears dost thou think sounded, how great a groaning and lamentation at the same time! And first the dashing on of the Argive spear broke us; then they again retreated; and next foot being interchanged with foot, and man standing against man, the battle waged fierce; and many fell; and there were two cries, O ye who [dwell in] Athens, O ye who sow the land of the Argives, will ye not avert disgrace from the city? And with difficulty doing every thing, not without toils did we put the Argive force to flight; and then the old man, seeing Hyllus rushing on, Iolaus, stretching forth his right hand, besought him to place him on the horse-chariot; and seizing the reins in his hands, he pressed hard upon the horses of Eurystheus. And what happened after this I must tell by having heard from others, I myself hitherto having seen all; for passing by the venerable hill of the divine Minerva of Pellene, seeing the chariot of Eurystheus, he prayed to Juno and Jupiter to be young for one day, and to work vengeance on his enemies. But you have a marvel to hear; for two stars standing on the horse-chariot, concealed the chariot in a dim cloud, the wiser men say it was thy son and Hebe; but he from the obscure darkness showed forth a youthful image of youthful arms. And the glorious Iolaus takes the four-horse chariot of Eurystheus at the Scironian rocks—and having bound his hands in fetters, he comes bringing as glorious first-fruits of victory, the general, him who before was prosperous; but by his present fortune he proclaims clearly to all mortals to learn not to envy him who seems prosperous, till one sees him dead, as fortune is but for the day.\nCHOR. O Jupiter, thou turner to flight, now is it mine to behold a day free from dreadful fear.\nALC. O Jupiter, at length you have looked upon my miseries, but still I thank you for what has been done: and I, who formerly did not think that my son dwelt with the Gods, now clearly know it. O children, now indeed you shall be free from toils, and free from Eurystheus, who shall perish miserably; and ye shall see the city of your sire, and you shall tread on your inheritance of land; and ye shall sacrifice to your ancestral gods, debarred from whom ye have had, as strangers, a wandering miserable life. But devising what clever thing has Iolaus spared Eurystheus, so as not to slay him, tell me; for in my opinion this is not wise, having taken our enemies, not to exact punishment of them.\nSERV. Having respect for you, that with your own eyes you may see him[30] defeated and subjected to your hand; not, indeed, of his own will, but he has bound him by force in constraint, for he was not willing to come alive into your sight and to be punished. But, O old woman, farewell, and remember for me what you first said when I began my tale. Make me free; and in such noble people as you the mouth ought to be free from falsehood.\nCHOR. To me the dance is sweet, if there be the thrilling delight of the pipe at the feast; and may Venus be kind. And sweet it is to see the good fortune of friends who did not expect it before; for the fate which accomplishes gifts gives birth to many things; and Time, the son of Saturn. You have, O city, a just path, you should never be deprived of it, to honor the Gods; and he who bids you not do so, is near madness, such proofs as these being shown. God, in truth, evidently exhorts us, taking away the arrogance of the unjust forever. Your son, O old woman, is gone to heaven; he shuns the report of having descended to the realm of Pluto, being consumed as to his body in the terrible flame of fire; and he embraces the lovely bed of Hebe in the golden hall. O Hymen, you have honored two children of Jupiter. Many things agree with many; for in truth they say that Minerva was an ally of their father, and the city and people of that Goddess has saved them, and has restrained the insolence of a man to whom passion was before justice, through violence. May my mind and soul, never be insatiable.\nMESS. O mistress, you see, but still it shall be said, we are come, bringing to you Eurystheus here, an unhoped-for sight, and one no less so for him to meet with, for he never expected to come into your hands when he went forth from Mycenæ with a much-toiling band of spearmen, proudly planning things much greater than his fortune, that he should destroy Athens; but the God changed his fortune, and made it contrary. Hyllus, therefore, and the good Iolaus, have set up a statue, in honor of their victory, of Jove, the putter to flight; and they send me to bring this man to you, wishing to delight your mind; for it is most delightful to see an enemy unfortunate, after having been fortunate.\nALC. O hateful thing, art thou come? has justice taken you at last? first then indeed turn hither your head toward me, and dare to look your enemies in the face; for now you are ruled, and you rule no more. Art thou he, for I wish to know, who chose, O wretch, much to insult my son, though no longer existing? For in what respect didst thou not dare to insult him? who led him, while alive, down to hell, and sent him forth, bidding him destroy hydras and lions? And I am silent concerning the other evils you contrived, for it would be a long story; and it did not satisfy you that he alone should endure these things, but you drove me also, and my children, out of all Greece, sitting as suppliants of the Gods, some old, and some still infants; but you found men and a city free, who feared you not. Thou needs must die miserably, and you shall gain every thing, for you ought to die not once only, having wrought many evil deeds.\nMESS. It is not practicable for you to put him to death.[31]\nALC. In vain then have we taken him prisoner. But what law hinders him from dying?\nMESS. It seems not so to the chiefs of this land.\nALC. What is this? not good to them to slay one's enemies?\nMESS. Not any one whom they have taken alive in battle.\nALC. And did Hyllus endure this decision?\nMESS. He could, I suppose, disobey this land![32]\nALC. He ought no longer to live, nor behold the light.\nMESS. Then first he did wrong in not dying.\nALC. Then it is no longer right for him to be punished?[33]\nMESS. There is no one who may put him to death.\nALC. I will. And yet I say that I am some one.\nMESS. You will indeed have much blame if you do this.\nALC. I love this city. It can not be denied. But as for this man, since he has come into my power, there is no mortal who shall take him from me. For this, whoever will may call me bold, and thinking things too much for a woman; but this deed shall be done by me.\nCHOR. It is a serious and excusable thing, O lady, for you to have hatred against this man, I well know it.\nEURYSTHEUS. O woman, know plainly that I will not flatter you, nor say any thing else for my life, whence I may incur any imputation of cowardice. But not of my own accord did I undertake this strife—I knew that I was your cousin by birth, and a relation to your son Hercules; but whether I wished it or not, Juno, for it was a Goddess, forced me to toil through this ill. But when I took up enmity against him, and determined to contest this contest, I became a contriver of many evils, and sitting continually in council with myself, I brought forth many plans by night, how dispersing and slaying my enemies, I might dwell for the future not with fear, knowing that your son was not one of the many, but truly a man; for though he be mine enemy, yet shall he be well spoken of, as he was a doughty man. And when he was released [from life], did it not behoove me, being hated by these children, and knowing their father's hatred to me, to move every stone, slaying and banishing them, and contriving, that, doing such things, my own affairs would have been safe? You, therefore, had you obtained my fortunes, would not have oppressed with evils the hostile offspring of a hated lion, but would wisely have permitted them to live in Argos; you will persuade no one of this. Now then, since they did not destroy me then, when I was willing, by the laws of the Greeks I shall, if slain, bear pollution to my slayer; and the city, being wise, has let me go, having greater honor for God than for its enmity toward me. And to what you said you have heard a reply: and now you may call me at once suppliant and brave.[34] Thus is the case with me, I do not wish to die, but I should not be grieved at leaving life.\nCHOR. I wish, O Alcmena, to advise you a little, to let go this man, since it seems so to the city.\nALC. But how, if he both die, and still we obey the city?\nCHOR. That would be best; but how can that be?\nALC. I will teach you, easily; for having slain him, then I will give his corpse to those of his friends who come after him; for I will not deny his body to the earth, but he dying, shall satisfy my revenge.\nEU. Slay me, I do not deprecate thy wrath. But this city indeed, since it has released me, and feared to slay me, I will present with an ancient oracle of Apollo, which, in time, will be of greater profit than you would expect; for ye will bury me when I am dead, where it is fated, before the temple of the divine virgin of Pallene; and being well disposed to you, and a protector to the city, I shall ever lie as a sojourner under the ground, but most hostile to their descendants when they come hither with much force, betraying this kindness: such strangers do ye now defend. How then did I, knowing this, come hither, and not respect the oracle of the God? Thinking Juno far more powerful than oracles, and that she would not betray me, [I did so.] But suffer neither libations nor blood to be poured on my tomb, for I will give them an evil return as a requital for these things; and ye shall have a double gain from me, I will both profit you and injure them by dying.\nALC. Why then do ye delay, if you are fated to accomplish safety to the city and to your descendants, to slay this man, hearing these things? for they show us the safest path. The man is an enemy, but he will profit us dying. Take him away, O servants; then having slain him, ye must give him to the dogs; for hope not thou, that living, thou shalt again banish me from my native land.\nCHOR. These things seem good to me, proceed, O attendants, for every thing on our part shall be done completely for our sovereigns.",

The play was first acted when Epameinon was Archon, Olympiad 87, year 4 (B.C. 429). Euripides was first, Iophon second, Ion third.\nAPHRODITE\nGreat among men, and not unnamed am I,\nThe Cyprian, in God's inmost halls on high.\nAnd wheresoe'er from Pontus to the far\nRed West men dwell, and see the glad day-star,\nAnd worship Me, the pious heart I bless,\nAnd wreck that life that lives in stubbornness.\nFor that there is, even in a great God's mind,\nThat hungereth for the praise of human kind.\nSo runs my word; and soon the very deed\nShall follow. For this Prince of Theseus' seed,\nHippolytus, child of that dead Amazon,\nAnd reared by saintly Pittheus in his own\nStrait ways, hath dared, alone of all Trozên,\nTo hold me least of spirits and most mean,\nAnd spurns my spell and seeks no woman's kiss,\nBut great Apollo's sister, Artemis,\nHe holds of all most high, gives love and praise,\nAnd through the wild dark woods for ever strays,\nHe and the Maid together, with swift hounds\nTo slay all angry beasts from out these bounds,\nTo more than mortal friendship consecrate!\nI grudge it not. No grudge know I, nor hate;\nYet, seeing he hath offended, I this day\nShall smite Hippolytus. Long since my way\nWas opened, nor needs now much labour more.\nFor once from Pittheus' castle to the shore\nOf Athens came Hippolytus over-seas\nSeeking the vision of the Mysteries.\nAnd Phaedra there, his father's Queen high-born;\nSaw him, and as she saw, her heart was torn\nWith great love, by the working of my will.\nAnd for his sake, long since, on Pallas' hill,\nDeep in the rock, that Love no more might roam,\nShe built a shrine, and named it Love-at-home :\nAnd the rock held it, but its face alway\nSeeks Trozên o'er the seas. Then came the day\nWhen Theseus, for the blood of kinsmen shed,\nSpake doom of exile on himself, and fled,\nPhaedra beside him, even to this Trozên.\nAnd here that grievous and amazed Queen,\nWounded and wondering, with ne'er a word,\nWastes slowly; and her secret none hath heard\nNor dreamed.\nBut never thus this love shall end!\nTo Theseus' ear some whisper will I send,\nAnd all be bare! And that proud Prince, my foe,\nHis sire shall slay with curses. Even so\nEndeth that boon the great Lord of the Main\nTo Theseus gave, the Three Prayers not in vain.\nAnd she, not in dishonour, yet shall die.\nI would not rate this woman's pain so high\nAs not to pay mine haters in full fee\nThat vengeance that shall make all well with me.\nBut soft, here comes he, striding from the chase,\nOur Prince Hippolytus!—I will go my ways.—\nAnd hunters at his heels: and a loud throng\nGlorying Artemis with praise and song!\nLittle he knows that Hell's gates opened are,\nAnd this his last look on the great Day-star!\n[APHRODITE withdraws, unseen by HIPPOLYTUS\nand a band of huntsmen, who enter from the left, singing.\nThey pass the Statue of APHRODITE without notice. ]\nHIPPOLYTUS\nFollow, O follow me,\nSinging on your ways\nHer in whose hand are we,\nHer whose own flock we be,\nThe Zeus-Child, the Heavenly;\nTo Artemis be praise!\nHUNTSMAN\nHail to thee, Maiden blest,\nProudest and holiest:\nGod's Daughter, great in bliss,\nLeto-born, Artemis!\nHail to thee, Maiden, far\nFairest of all that are,\nYea, and most high thine home,\nChild of the Father's hall;\nHear, O most virginal,\nHear, O most fair of all,\nIn high God's golden dome.\n[ The huntsmen have gathered about the altar of ARTEMIS.\nHIPPOLYTUS now advances from them, and approaches the Statue\nwith a wreath in his hand. ]\nHIPPOLYTUS\nTo thee this wreathed garland, from a green\nAnd virgin meadow bear I, O my Queen,\nWhere never shepherd leads his grazing ewes\nNor scythe has touched. Only the river dews\nGleam, and the spring bee sings, and in the glade\nHath Solitude her mystic garden made.\nNo evil hand may cull it: only he\nWhose heart hath known the heart of Purity,\nUnlearned of man, and true whate'er befall.\nTake therefore from pure hands this coronal,\nO mistress loved, thy golden hair to twine.\nFor, sole of living men, this grace is mine,\nTo dwell with thee, and speak, and hear replies\nOf voice divine, though none may see thine eyes.\nOh, keep me to the end in this same road!\n[ An OLD HUNTSMAN,  who has stood apart from\nthe rest, here comes up to HIPPOLYTUS.]\nHUNTSMAN\nMy Prince—for 'Master' name I none but God—\nGave I good counsel, wouldst thou welcome it?\nHIPPOLYTUS\nRight gladly, friend; else were I poor of wit.\nHUNTSMAN\nKnowest thou one law, that through the world has won?\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWhat wouldst thou? And how runs thy law? Say on.\nHUNTSMAN\nIt hates that Pride that speaks not all men fair!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nAnd rightly.   Pride breeds hatred everywhere.\nHUNTSMAN\nAnd good words love, and grace in all men's sight?\nHIPPOLYTUS\nAye, and much gain withal, for trouble slight.\nHUNTSMAN\nHow deem'st thou of the Gods? Are they the same?\nHIPPOLYTUS\nSurely: we are but fashioned on their frame.\nHUNTSMAN\nWhy then wilt thou be proud, and worship not..\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWhom? If the name be speakable, speak out!\nHUNTSMAN\nShe stands here at thy gate: the Cyprian Queen!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nI greet her from afar: my life is clean.\nHUNTSMAN\nClean? Nay, proud, proud; a mark for all to scan!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nEach mind hath its own bent, for God or man.\nHUNTSMAN\nGod grant thee happiness.. and wiser thought!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nThese Spirits that reign in darkness like me not.\nHUNTSMAN\nWhat the Gods ask, O Son, that man must pay!\nHIPPOLYTUS ( turning from him to the others ).\nOn, huntsmen, to the Castle! Make your way\nStraight to the feast room; 'tis a merry thing\nAfter the chase, a board of banqueting.\nAnd see the steeds be groomed, and in array\nThe chariot dight. I drive them forth to-day\n[ He pauses, and makes a slight gesture of reverence to the Statue on\nthe left. Then to the OLD HUNTSMAN.]\nThat for thy Cyprian, friend, and nought beside!\n[HIPPOLYTUS follows the huntsmen, who stream by the central door in\nthe Castle. The OLD HUNTSMAN remains]\nHUNTSMAN ( approaching the Statue and kneeling )\nO Cyprian—for a young man in his pride\nI will not follow!—here before thee, meek,\nIn that one language that a slave may speak,\nI pray thee; Oh, if some wild heart in froth\nOf youth surges against thee, be not wroth\nFor ever! Nay, be far and hear not then:\nGods should be gentler and more wise than men!\n[ He rises and follows the others into the Castle.]\nThe Orchestra is empty for a moment, then there enter from right and\nleft several Trosenian women young and old. Their number eventually\namounts to fifteen.\nCHORUS\nThere riseth a rock-born river,\nOf Ocean's tribe, men say;\nThe crags of it gleam and quiver,\nAnd pitchers dip in the spray:\nA woman was there with raiment white\nTo bathe and spread in the warm sunlight,\nAnd she told a tale to me there by the river\nThe tale of the Queen and her evil day:\nHow, ailing beyond allayment,\nWithin she hath bowed her head,\nAnd with shadow of silken raiment\nThe bright brown hair bespread.\nFor three long days she hath lain forlorn,\nHer lips untainted of flesh or corn,\nFor that secret sorrow beyond allayment\nThat steers to the far sad shore of the dead.\nSome Women\nIs this some Spirit, O child of man?\nDoth Hecat hold thee perchance, or Pan?\nDoth she of the Mountains work her ban,\nOr the dread Corybantes bind thee?\nOthers\nNay, is it sin that upon thee lies,\nSin of forgotten sacrifice,\nIn thine own Dictynna's sea-wild eyes?\nWho in Limna here can find thee;\nFor the Deep's dry floor is her easy way,\nAnd she moves in the salt wet whirl of the spray.\nOther Women\nOr doth the Lord of Erechtheus' race,\nThy Theseus, watch for a fairer face,\nFor secret arms in a silent place,\nFar from thy love or chiding?\nOthers\nOr hath there landed, amid the loud\nHum of Piraeus' sailor-crowd,\nSome Cretan venturer, weary-browed,\nWho bears to the Queen some tiding;\nSome far home-grief, that hath bowed her low,\nAnd chained her soul to a bed of woe?\nAn Older Woman\nNay—know yet not?—this burden hath alway lain\nOn the devious being of woman; yea, burdens twain,\nThe burden of Wild Will and the burden of Pain.\nThrough my heart once that wind of terror sped;\nBut I, in fear confessèd,\nCried from the dark to Her in heavenly bliss,\nThe Helper of Pain, the Bow-Maid Artemis:\nWhose feet I praise for ever, where they tread\nFar off among the blessèd!\nTHE LEADER\nBut see, the Queen's grey nurse at the door,\nSad-eyed and sterner, methinks, than of yore\nWith the Queen. Doth she lead her hither\nTo the wind and sun?—Ah, fain would I know\nWhat strange betiding hath blanched that brow\nAnd made that young life wither.\n[ The NURSE comes out from the central door followed by PHAEDRA,\nwho is supported by two handmaids. They make ready a couch for\nPHAEDRA to lie upon.]\nNURSE\nO sick and sore are the days of men!\nWhat wouldst thou?  What shall I change again\nHere is the Sun for thee; here is the sky;\nAnd thy weary pillows wind-swept lie,\nBy the castle door.\nBut the cloud of thy brow is dark, I ween;\nAnd soon thou wilt back to thy bower within:\nSo swift to change is the path of thy feet,\nAnd near things hateful, and far things sweet;\nSo was it before!\nOh, pain were better than tending pain!\nFor that were single, and this is twain,\nWith grief of heart and labour of limb.\nYet all man's life is but ailing and dim,\nAnd rest upon earth comes never.\nBut if any far-off state there be,\nDearer than life to mortality;\nThe hand of the Dark hath hold thereof,\nAnd mist is under and mist above.\nAnd so we are sick of life, and cling\nOn earth to this nameless and shining thing.\nFor other life is a fountain sealed,\nAnd the deeps below are unrevealed,\nAnd we drift on legends for ever!\n[PHAEDRA during this has been laid on her couch;\nshe speaks to the handmaids.]\nPHAEDRA\nYes; lift me: not my head so low.\nThere, hold my arms.—Fair arms they seem!—\nMy poor limbs scarce obey me now!\nTake off that hood that weighs my brow,\nAnd let my long hair stream.\nNURSE\nNay, toss not, Child, so feveredly.\nThe sickness best will win relief\nBy quiet rest and constancy.\nAll men have grief.\nPHAEDRA ( not noticing her )\nOh for a deep and dewy spring,\nWith runlets cold to draw and drink!\nAnd a great meadow blossoming,\nLong-grassed, and poplars in a ring,\nTo rest me by the brink!\nNURSE\nNay, Child!   Shall strangers hear this tone\nSo wild, and thoughts so fever-flown?\nPHAEDRA\nOh, take me to the Mountain! Oh,\nPass the great pines and through the wood,\nUp where the lean hounds softly go,\nA-whine for wild things' blood,\nAnd madly flies the dappled roe.\nO God, to shout and speed them there,\nAn arrow by my chestnut hair\nDrawn tight, and one keen glimmering spear—\nAh! if I could!\nNURSE\nWhat wouldst thou with them—fancies all!—\nThy hunting and thy fountain brink?\nWhat wouldst thou? By the city wall\nCanst hear our own brook plash and fall\nDownhill, if thou wouldst drink.\nPHAEDRA\nO Mistress of the Sea-lorn Mere\nWhere horse-hoofs beat the sand and sing,\nO Artemis, that I were there\nTo tame Enetian steeds and steer\nSwift chariots in the ring!\nNURSE\nNay, mountainward but now thy hands\nYearned out, with craving for the chase;\nAnd now toward the unseaswept sands\nThou roamest, where the coursers pace!\nO wild young steed, what prophet knows\nThe power that holds thy curb, and throws\nThy swift heart from its race?\n[ At these words PHAEDRA gradually recovers herself\nand pays attention. ]\nPHAEDRA\nWhat have I said? Woe's me! And where\nGone straying from my wholesome mind?\nWhat? Did I fall in some god's snare?\n—Nurse, veil my head again, and blind\nMine eyes.—There is a tear behind\nThat lash.—Oh, I am sick with shame!\nAye, but it hath a sting,\nTo come to reason; yet the name\nOf madness is an awful thing.—\nCould I but die in one swift flame\nUnthinking, unknowing!\nNURSE\nI veil thy face, Child.—Would that so\nMine own were veiled for evermore,\nSo sore I love thee!... Though the lore\nOf long life mocks me, and I know\nHow love should be a lightsome thing\nNot rooted in the deep o' the heart;\nWith gentle ties, to twine apart\nIf need so call, or closer cling.—\nWhy do I love thee so? O fool,\nO fool, the heart that bleeds for twain,\nAnd builds, men tell us, walls of pain,\nTo walk by love's unswerving rule\nThe same for ever, stern and true!\nFor 'Thorough' is no word of peace:\n'Tis 'Naught-too-much' makes trouble cease.\nAnd many a wise man bows thereto.\n[ The LEADER OF THE CHORUS here approaches the NURSE.]\nLEADER\nNurse of our Queen, thou watcher old and true,\nWe see her great affliction, but no clue\nHave we to learn the sickness. Wouldst thou tell\nThe name and sort thereof, 'twould like us well.\nNURSE\nSmall leechcraft have I, and she tells no man.\nLEADER\nThou know'st no cause? Nor when the unrest began?\nNURSE\nIt all comes to the same. She will not speak.\nLEADER ( turning and looking at PHAEDRA).\nHow she is changed and wasted! And how weak!\nNURSE\n'Tis the third day she hath fasted utterly.\nLEADER\nWhat, is she mad? Or doth she seek to die?\nNURSE\nI know not. But to death it sure must lead.\nLEADER\n'Tis strange that Theseus takes hereof no heed.\nNURSE\nShe hides her wound, and vows it is not so.\nLEADER\nCan he not look into her face and know?\nNURSE\nNay, he is on a journey these last days.\nLEADER\nCanst thou not force her, then? Or think of ways\nTo trap the secret of the sick heart's pain?\nNURSE\nHave I not tried all ways, and all in vain?\nYet will I cease not now, and thou shalt tell\nIf in her grief I serve my mistress well!\n[ She goes across to where PHAEDRA lies; and\npresently, while speaking, kneels by her.]\nDear daughter mine, all that before was said\nLet both of us forget; and thou instead\nBe kindlier, and unlock that prisoned brow.\nAnd I, who followed then the wrong road, now\nWill leave it and be wiser. If thou fear\nSome secret sickness, there be women here\nTo give thee comfort. [PHAEDRA shakes her head.\nNo; not secret? Then\nIs it a sickness meet for aid of men?\nSpeak, that a leech may tend thee.\nSilent still?\nNay, Child, what profits silence? If 'tis ill\nThis that I counsel, makes me see the wrong:\nIf well, then yield to me.\nNay, Child, I long\nFor one kind word, one look!\n[PHAEDRA lies motionless. The NURSE rises. ]\nOh, woe is me!\nWomen, we labour here all fruitlessly,\nAll as far off as ever from her heart!\nShe ever scorned me, and now hears no part\nOf all my prayers! [ Turning to PHAEDRA again. ]\nNay, hear thou shalt, and be,\nIf so thou will, more wild than the wild sea;\nBut know, thou art thy little ones' betrayer!\nIf thou die now, shall child of thine be heir\nTo Theseus' castle? Nay, not thine, I ween,\nBut hers! That barbèd Amazonian Queen\nHath left a child to bend thy children low,\nA bastard royal-hearted—sayst not so?—\nHippolytus...\nPHAEDRA\nAh!\n[ She starts up, sitting, and throws the veil off.]\nNURSE\nThat stings thee?\nPHAEDRA\nNurse, most sore\nThou hast hurt me! In God's name, speak that name no more.\nNURSE\nThou seest? Thy mind is clear; but with thy mind\nThou wilt not save thy children, nor be kind\nTo thine own life.\nPHAEDRA\nMy children?  Nay, most dear\nI love them,—Far, far other grief is here.\nNURSE ( after a pause, wondering )\nThy hand is clean, O Child, from stain of blood?\nPHAEDRA\nMy hand is clean; but is my heart, O God?\nNURSE\nSome enemy's spell hath made thy spirit dim?\nPHAEDRA\nHe hates me not that slays me, nor I him.\nNURSE\nTheseus, the King, hath wronged thee in man's wise?\nPHAEDRA\nAh, could but I stand guiltless in his eyes!\nNURSE\nO speak! What is this death-fraught mystery?\nPHAEDRA\nNay, leave me to my wrong. I wrong not thee.\nNURSE ( suddenly throwing herself in supplication at PHAEDRA'S feet )\nNot wrong me, whom thou wouldst all desolate leave?\nPHAEDRA ( rising and trying to move away )\nWhat wouldst thou? Force me? Clinging to my sleeve?\nNURSE\nYea, to thy knees; and weep; and let not go!\nPHAEDRA\nWoe to thee, Woman, if thou learn it, woe!\nNURSE\nI know no bitterer woe than losing thee.\nPHAEDRA\nYet the deed shall honour me.\nNURSE\nWhy hide what honours thee? 'Tis all I claim!\nPHAEDRA\nWhy, so I build up honour out of shame!\nNURSE\nThen speak, and higher still thy fame shall stand.\nPHAEDRA\nGo, in God's name!—Nay, leave me; loose my hand!\nNURSE\nNever, until thou grant me what I pray.\nPHAEDRA ( yielding, after a pause )\nSo be it. I dare not tear that hand away.\nNURSE ( rising and releasing PHAEDRA )\nTell all thou wilt, Daughter. I speak no more.\nPHAEDRA ( after a long pause )\nMother, poor Mother, that didst love so sore!\nNURSE\nWhat mean'st thou, Child? The Wild Bull of the Tide?\nPHAEDRA\nAnd thou, sad sister, Dionysus' bride!\nNURSE\nChild! wouldst thou shame the house where thou wast born?\nPHAEDRA\nAnd I the third, sinking most all-forlorn!\nNURSE ( to herself )\nI am all lost and feared. What will she say?\nPHAEDRA\nFrom there my grief comes, not from yesterday.\nNURSE\nI come no nearer to thy parable.\nPHAEDRA\nOh, would that thou could'st tell what I must tell!\nNURSE\nI am no seer in things I wot not of.\nPHAEDRA ( again hesitating )\nWhat is it that they mean, who say men...love?\nNURSE\nA thing most sweet, my Child, yet dolorous.\nPHAEDRA\nOnly the half, belike, hath fallen on us!\nNURSE  ( starting )\nOn thee? Love?—Oh, what say'st thou? What man's son?\nPHAEDRA\nWhat man's? There was a Queen, an Amazon...\nNURSE\nHippolytus, say'st thou?\nPHAEDRA ( again wrapping her face in the veil )\nNay, 'twas thou, not I!\n[PHAEDRA sinks back on the couch and covers her face again.\nThe NURSE starts violently from her and walks up and down. ]\nNURSE\nO God! what wilt thou say, Child? Wouldst thou try\nTo kill me?—Oh, 'tis more than I can bear;\nWomen. I will no more of it, this glare\nOf hated day, this shining of the sky.\nI will fling down my body, and let it lie\nTill life be gone!\nWomen, God rest with you,\nMy works are over! For the pure and true\nAre forced to evil, against their own heart's vow,\nAnd love it!\n[ She suddenly sees the Statue of CYPRIS,  and\nstands with her eyes riveted upon it. ]\nAh, Cyprian! No god art thou,\nBut more than god, and greater, that hath thrust\nMe and my queen and all our house to dust!\n[ She throws herself on the ground close to the statue. ]\nCHORUS\nSome Women\nO Women, have ye heard? Nay, dare ye hear\nThe desolate cry of the young Queen's misery?\nA Woman\nMy Queen, I love thee dear,\nYet liefer were I dead than framed like thee.\nOthers\nWoe, woe to me for this thy bitter bane,\nSurely the food man feeds upon is pain!\nOthers\nHow wilt thou bear thee through this livelong day,\nLost, and thine evil naked to the light?\nStrange things are close upon us—who shall say\nHow strange?—save one thing that is plain to sight,\nThe stroke of the Cyprian and the fall thereof\nOn thee, thou child of the Isle of fearful Love!\n[PHAEDRA during this has risen from the couch and comes forward\ncollectedly. As she speaks the NURSE gradually rouses herself,\nand listens more calmly. ]\nPHAEDRA\nO Women, dwellers in this portal-seat\nOf Pelops' land, gazing towards my Crete,\nHow oft, in other days than these, have I\nThrough night's long hours thought of man's misery,\nAnd how this life is wrecked! And, to mine eyes,\nNot in man's knowledge, not in wisdom, lies\nThe lack that makes for sorrow. Nay, we scan\nAnd know the right—for wit hath many a man—\nBut will not to the last end strive and serve.\nFor some grow too soon weary, and some swerve\nTo other paths, setting before the Right\nThe diverse far-off image of Delight:\nAnd many are delights beneath the sun!\nLong hours of converse; and to sit alone\nMusing—a deadly happiness!—and Shame:\nThough two things there be hidden in one name,\nAnd Shame can be slow poison if it will;\nThis is the truth I saw then, and see still;\nNor is there any magic that can stain\nThat white truth for me, or make me blind again.\nCome, I will show thee how my spirit hath moved.\nWhen the first stab came, and I knew I loved,\nI cast about how best to face mine ill.\nAnd the first thought that came, was to be still\nAnd hide my sickness.—For no trust there is\nIn man's tongue, that so well admonishes\nAnd counsels and betrays, and waxes fat\nWith griefs of its own gathering!—After that\nI would my madness bravely bear, and try\nTo conquer by mine own heart's purity.\nMy third mind, when these two availed me naught\nTo quell love was to die—\n[ Motion of protest among the Women. ]\n—the best, best thought— —Gainsay me not—of all that man can say!\nI would not have mine honour hidden away;\nWhy should I have my shame before men's eyes\nKept living? And I knew, in deadly wise,\nShame was the deed and shame the suffering;\nAnd I a woman, too, to face the thing,\nDespised of all!\nOh, utterly accurst\nBe she of women, whoso dared the first\nTo cast her honour out to a strange man!\n'Twas in some great house, surely, that began\nThis plague upon us; then the baser kind,\nWhen the good led towards evil, followed blind\nAnd joyous! Cursed be they whose lips are clean\nAnd wise and seemly, but their hearts within\nRank with bad daring! How can they, O Thou\nThat walkest on the waves, great Cyprian, how\nSmile in their husbands' faces, and not fall,\nNot cower before the Darkness that knows all,\nAye, dread the dead still chambers, lest one day\nThe stones find voice, and all be finished!\nNay,\nFriends, 'tis for this I die; lest I stand there\nHaving shamed my husband and the babes I bare.\nIn ancient Athens they shall some day dwell,\nMy babes, free men, free-spoken, honourable,\nEURIPIDES\nAnd when one asks their mother, proud of me!\nFor, oh, it cows a man, though bold he be,\nTo know a mother's or a father's sin.\n'Tis written, one way is there, one, to win\nThis life's race, could man keep it from his birth,\nA true clean spirit. And through all this earth\nTo every false man, that hour comes apace\nWhen Time holds up a mirror to his face,\nAnd girl-like, marvelling, there he stares to see\nHow foul his heart! Be it not so with me!\nLEADER OF CHORUS\nAh, God, how sweet is virtue, and how wise,\nAnd honour its due meed in all men's eyes!\nNURSE ( who has now risen and recovered herself )\nMistress, a sharp swift terror struck me low\nA moment since, hearing of this thy woe.\nBut now—I was a coward! And men say\nOur second thought the wiser is alway.\nThis is no monstrous thing; no grief too dire\nTo meet with quiet thinking. In her ire\nA most strong goddess hath swept down on thee.\nThou lovest. Is that so strange? Many there be\nBeside thee!... And because thou lovest, wilt fall\nAnd die! And must all lovers die, then? All\nThat are or shall be? A blithe law for them!\nNay, when in might she swoops, no strength can stem\nCypris; and if man yields him, she is sweet;\nBut is he proud and stubborn? From his feet\nShe lifts him, and—how think you?—flings to scorn!\nShe ranges with the stars of eve and morn,\nShe wanders in the heaving of the sea,\nAnd all life lives from her.—Aye, this is she\nThat sows Love's seed and brings Love's fruit to birth;\nAnd great Love's brethren are all we on earth!\nNay, they who con grey books of ancient days\nOr dwell among the Muses, tell—and praise—\nHow Zeus himself once yearned for Semelê;\nHow maiden Eôs in her radiancy\nSwept Kephalos to heaven away, away,\nFor sore love's sake. And there they dwell, men say,\nAnd fear not, fret not; for a thing too stern\nHath met and crushed them!\nAnd must thou, then, turn\nAnd struggle? Sprang there from thy father's blood\nThy little soul all lonely? Or the god\nThat rules thee, is he other than our gods?\nNay, yield thee to men's ways, and kiss their rods!\nHow many, deem'st thou, of men good and wise\nKnow their own home's blot, and avert their eyes?\nHow many fathers, when a son has strayed\nAnd toiled beneath the Cyprian, bring him aid,\nNot chiding? And man's wisdom e'er hath been\nTo keep what is not good to see, unseen!\nA straight and perfect life is not for man;\nNay, in a shut house, let him, if he can,\n'Mid sheltered rooms, make all lines true. But here,\nOut in the wide sea fallen, and full of fear,\nHopest thou so easily to swim to land?\nCanst thou but set thine ill days on one hand\nAnd more good days on the other, verily,\nO child of woman, life is well with thee!\n[ She pauses, and then draws nearer to PHAEDRA.]\nNay, dear my daughter, cease thine evil mind,\nCease thy fierce pride! For pride it is, and blind,\nTo seek to outpass gods!—Love on and dare:\nA god hath willed it! And, since pain is there,\nMake the pain sleep! Songs are there to bring calm,\nAnd magic words. And I shall find the balm,\nBe sure, to heal thee. Else in sore dismay\nWere men, could not we women find our way!\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nHelp is there, Queen, in all this woman says,\nTo ease thy suffering. But 'tis thee I praise;\nAlbeit that praise is harder to thine ear\nThan all her chiding was, and bitterer!\nPHAEDRA\nOh, this it is hath flung to dogs and birds\nMen's lives and homes and cities-fair false word!\nOh, why speak things to please our ears? We crave\nNot that. Tis honour, honour, we must save!\nNURSE\nWhy prate so proud! 'Tis no words, brave nor base\nThou cravest; 'tis a man's arms!\n[PHAEDRA moves indignantly.]\nUp and face\nThe truth of what thou art, and name it straight!\nWere not thy life thrown open here for Fate\nTo beat on; hadst thou been a woman pure\nOr wise or strong; never had I for lure\nOf joy nor heartache led thee on to this!\nBut when a whole life one great battle is,\nTo win or lose—no man can blame me then.\nPHAEDRA\nShame on thee! Lock those lips, and ne'er again\nLet word nor thought so foul have harbour there!\nNURSE\nFoul, if thou wilt: but better than the fair\nFor thee and me. And better, too, the deed\nBehind them, if it save thee in thy need,\nThan that word Honour thou wilt die to win!\nPHAEDRA\nNay, in God's name,—such wisdom and such sin\nAre all about thy lips!—urge me no more.\nFor all the soul within me is wrought o'er\nBy Love; and if thou speak and speak, I may\nBe spent, and drift where now I shrink away.\nNURSE\nWell, if thou wilt!—'Twere best never to err,\nBut, having erred, to take a counsellor\nIs second.—Mark me now. I have within\nlove-philtres, to make peace where storm hath been,\nThat, with no shame, no scathe of mind, shall save\nThy life from anguish; wilt but thou be brave!\n[ To herself, rejecting.]\nAh, but from him, the well-beloved, some sign\nWe need, or word, or raiment's hem, to twine\nAmid the charm, and one spell knit from twain.\nPHAEDRA\nIs it a potion or a salve? Be plain.\nNURSE\nWho knows? Seek to be helped, Child, not to know.\nPHAEDRA\nWhy art thou ever subtle? I dread thee, so.\nNURSE\nThou wouldst dread everything!—What dost thou dread?\nPHAEDRA\nLeast to his ear some word be whispered.\nNURSE\nLet be, Child! I will make all well with thee!\n—Only do thou, O Cyprian of the Sea,\nBe with me! And mine own heart, come what may,\nShall know what ear to seek, what word to say!\n[ The NURSE,  having spoken these last words in prayer apart to the\nStatue of CYPRIS,  turns back and goes into the house. PHAEDRA sits\npensive again on her couch till towards the end of the following Song,\nwhen she rises and bends close to the door.]\nCHORUS\nErôs, Erôs, who blindest, tear by tear,\nMen's eyes with hunger; thou swift Foe\nthat  pliest\nDeep in our hearts joy like an edgèd spear;\nCome  not  to  me  with  Evil  haunting  near,\nWrath on the wind, nor jarring of the clear\nWing's music as thou fliest!\nThere is no shaft that burneth, not in fire,\nNot in wild stars, far off and flinging fear,\nAs in thine hands the shaft of All Desire,\nErôs, Child of the Highest!\nIn vain, in vain, by old Alpheüs' shore\nThe blood of many bulls doth stain the river\nAnd all Greece bows on Phoebus' Pythian floor;\nYet bring we to the Master of Man no store\nThe Keybearer, who standeth at the door\nClose-barred, where hideth ever\nThe heart of the shrine. Yea, though he sack\nman's  life\nLike a sacked city, and moveth evermore\nGirt with calamity and strange ways of strife,\nHim have we worshipped never!\nThere roamed a Steed in Oechalia's wild,\nA Maid without yoke, without Master,\nAnd Love she knew not, that far King's child;\nBut he came, he came, with a song in the night.\nWith fire, with blood; and she strove in flight,\nA Torrent Spirit, a Maenad white,\nFaster and vainly faster,\nSealed unto Heracles by the Cyprian's Might.\nAlas, thou Bride of Disaster!\nO Mouth of Dirce, O god-built wall,\nThat Dirce's wells run under,\nYe know the Cyprian's fleet footfall!\nYe saw the heavens around her flare,\nWhen she lulled to her sleep that Mother fair\nOf twy-born Bacchus, and decked her there\nThe Bride of the bladed Thunder.\nFor her breath is on all that hath life, and she floats in the air,\nBee-like, death-like, a wonder.\n[ During the last lines PHAEDRA has approached the door\nand is listening.]\nPHAEDRA\nSilence ye Women! Something is amiss.\nLEADER\nHow? In the house?—Phaedra, what fear is this?\nPHAEDRA\nLet me but listen! There are voices. Hark!\nLEADER\nI hold my peace: yet is thy presage dark.\nPHAEDRA\nOh, misery!\nO God, that such a thing should fall on me!\nLEADER\nWhat sound, what word,\nO Women, Friend, makes that sharp terror start\nOut at thy lips? What ominous cry half-heard\nHath leapt upon thine heart?\nPHAEDRA\nI am undone!—Bend to the door and hark,\nHark what a tone sounds there, and sinks away!\nLEADER\nThou art beside the bars. 'Tis thine to mark\nThe castle's floating message. Say, Oh, say\nWhat thing hath come to thee?\nPHAEDRA ( calmly )\nWhy, what thing should it be?\nThe son of that proud Amazon speaks again\nIn bitter wrath: speaks to my handmaiden!\nLEADER\nI hear a noise of voices, nothing clear.\nFor thee the din hath words, as through barred locks\nFloating, at thy heart it knocks.\nPHAEDRA\n'Pander of Sin' it says.—Now canst thou hear?—\nAnd there: 'Betrayer of a master's bed.'\nLEADER\nAh me, betrayed! Betrayed!\nSweet Princess, thou art ill bested,\nThy secret brought to light, and ruin near,\nBy her thou heldest dear,\nBy her that should have loved thee and obeyed!\nPHAEDRA\nAye, I am slain. She thought to help my fall\nWith love instead of honour, and wrecked all.\nLEADER\nWhere wilt thou turn thee, where?\nAnd what help seek, O wounded to despair?\nPHAEDRA\nI know not, save one thing to die right soon.\nFor such as me God keeps no other boon.\n[ The door in the centre bursts open, and HIPPOLYTUS comes forth,\nclosely followed by the NURSE. PHAEDRA cowers aside.]\nHIPPOLYTUS\nO Mother Earth, O Sun that makest clean,\nWhat poison have I heard, what speechless sin!\nNURSE\nHush O my Prince, lest others mark, and guess...\nHIPPOLYTUS\nI have heard horrors! Shall I hold my peace?\nNURSE\nYea by this fair right arm, Son, by thy pledge...\nHIPPOLYTUS\nDown with that hand! Touch not my garment's edge!\nNURSE\nOh, by thy knees, be silent or I die!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWhy, when thy speech was all so guiltless? Why?\nNURSE\nIt is not meet, fair Son, for every ear!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nGood words can bravely forth, and have no fear.\nNURSE\nThine oath, thine oath! I took thine oath before!\nHIPPOLYTUS\n'Twas but my tongue, 'twas not my soul that swore.\nNURSE\nO Son, what wilt thou? Wilt thou slay thy kin?\nHIPPOLYTUS\nI own no kindred with the spawn of sin!\n[ He flings her from him.]\nNURSE\nNay, spare me! Man was born to err; oh, spare!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nO God, why hast Thou made this gleaming snare,\nWoman, to dog us on the happy earth?\nWas it Thy will to make Man, why his birth\nThrough Love and Woman? Could we not have rolled\nOur store of prayer and offering, royal gold\nSilver and weight of bronze before Thy feet,\nAnd bought of God new child souls, as were meet\nFor each man's sacrifice, and dwelt in homes\nFree, where nor Love nor Woman goes and comes\nHow, is that daughter not a bane confessed,\nWhom her own sire sends forth—(He knows her best!)—\nAnd, will some man but take her, pays a dower!\nAnd he, poor fool, takes home the poison-flower;\nLaughs to hang jewels on the deadly thing\nHe joys in; labours for her robe-wearing,\nTill wealth and peace are dead. He smarts the less\nIn whose high seat is set a Nothingness,\nA woman naught availing. Worst of all\nThe wise deep-thoughted! Never in my hall\nMay she sit throned who thinks and waits and sighs!\nFor Cypris breeds most evil in the wise,\nAnd least in her whose heart has naught within;\nFor puny wit can work but puny sin.\nWhy do we let their handmaids pass the gate?\nWild beasts were best, voiceless and fanged, to wait\nAbout their rooms, that they might speak with none,\nNor ever hear one answering human tone!\nBut now dark women in still chambers lay\nPlans that creep out into light of day\nOn handmaids' lips—[ Turning to the NURSE.]\nAs thine accursèd head\nBraved the high honour of my Father's bed.\nAnd came to traffic... Our white torrent's spray\nShall drench mine ears to wash those words away!\nAnd couldst thou dream that I...? I feel impure\nStill at the very hearing! Know for sure,\nWoman, naught but mine honour saves ye both.\nHadst thou not trapped me with that guileful oath,\nNo power had held me secret till the King\nKnew all! But now, while he is journeying,\nI too will go my ways and make no sound.\nAnd when he comes again, I shall be found\nBeside him, silent, watching with what grace\nThou and thy mistress shall greet him face to face!\nThen shall I have the taste of it, and know\nWhat woman's guile is.—Woe upon you, woe!\nHow can I too much hate you, while the ill\nYe work upon the world grows deadlier still?\nToo much? Make woman pure, and wild Love tame,\nOr let me cry for ever on their shame!\n[ He goes off in fury to the left.\nPHAEDRA still cowering in her place begins to sob.]\nPHAEDRA\nSad, sad and evil-starred is Woman's state.\nWhat shelter now is left or guard?\nWhat spell to loose the iron knot of fate?\nAnd this thing, O my God,\nO thou sweet Sunlight, is but my desert!\nI cannot fly before the avenging rod\nFalls, cannot hide my hurt.\nWhat help, O ye who love me, can come near,\nWhat god or man appear,\nTo aid a thing so evil and so lost?\nLost, for this anguish presses, soon or late,\nTo that swift river that no life hath crossed.\nNo woman ever lived so desolate!\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\nAh me, the time for deeds is gone; the boast\nProved vain that spake thine handmaid; and all lost!\n[ At these words PHAEDRA suddenly remembers the NURSE,  who is\ncowering silently where HIPPOLYTUS had thrown her from him.\nShe turns upon her.]\nPHAEDRA\nO wicked, wicked, wicked! Murderess heart\nTo them that loved thee! Hast thou played thy part?\nAm I enough trod down?\nMay Zeus, my sire,\nBlast and uproot thee! Stab thee dead with fire!\nSaid I not—Knew I not thine heart?—to name\nTo no one soul this that is now my shame?\nAnd thou couldst not be silent! So no more\nI die in honour. But enough; a store\nOf new words must be spoke and new things thought.\nThis man's whole being to one blade is wrought\nOf rage against me. Even now he speeds\nTo abase me to the King with thy misdeeds;\nTell Pittheus; fill the land with talk of sin!\nCursèd be thou, and whoso else leaps in\nTo bring bad aid to friends that want it not.\n[ The NURSE has raised herself, and faces PHAEDRA,\ndowncast but calm.]\nNURSE\nMistress, thou blamest me; and all thy lot\nSo bitter sore is, and the sting so wild,\nI bear with all. Yet, if I would, my Child,\nI have mine answer, couldst thou hearken aught.\nI nursed thee, and I love thee; and I sought\nOnly some balm to heal thy deep despair,\nAnd found—not what I sought for. Else I were\nWise, and thy friend, and good, had all sped right.\nSo fares it with us all in the world's sight.\nPHAEDRA\nFirst stab me to the heart, then humour me\nWith words! 'Tis fair; 'tis all as it should be!\nNURSE\nWe talk too long, Child. I did ill; but, oh,\nThere is a way to save thee, even so!\nPHAEDRA\nA way? No more ways! One way hast thou trod\nAlready, foul and false and loathed of god!\nBegone out of my sight; and ponder how\nThine own life stands! I need no helpers now.\n[ She turns from the NURSE,  who creeps abashed away into the Castle.]\nOnly do ye, high Daughters of Trozên,\nLet all ye hear be as it had not been;\nKnow naught, and speak of naught! 'Tis my last prayer.\nLEADER\nBy God's pure daughter, Artemis, I swear,\nNo word will I of these thy griefs reveal!\nPHAEDRA\n'Tis well. But now, yea, even while I reel\nAnd falter, one poor hope, as hope now is,\nI clutch at in this coil of miseries;\nTo save some honour for my children's sake;\nYea, for myself some fragment, though things break\nIn ruin around me. Nay, I will not shame\nThe old proud Cretan castle whence I came,\nI will not cower before King Theseus' eyes,\nAbased, for want of one life's sacrifice!\nLEADER\nWhat wilt thou?   Some dire deed beyond recall?\nPHAEDRA ( musing )\nDie; but how die?\nLEADER\nLet not such wild words fall!\nPHAEDRA ( turning upon her )\nGive thou not such light counsel! Let me be\nTo sate the Cyprian that is murdering me!\nTo-day shall be her day; and, all strife past\nHer bitter Love shall quell me at the last.\nYet, dying, shall I die another's bane!\nHe shall not stand so proud where I have lain\nBent in the dust! Oh, he shall stoop to share\nThe life I live in, and learn mercy there!\n[ She goes off wildly into the Castle.]\nCHORUS\nCould I take me to some cavern for mine hiding,\nIn the hill-tops where the Sun scarce hath trod;\nOr a cloud make the home of mine abiding,\nAs a bird among the bird-droves of God!\nCould I wing me to my rest amid the roar\nOf the deep Adriatic on the shore,\nWhere the waters of Eridanus are clear,\nAnd Phaëthon's sad sisters by his grave\nWeep into the river, and each tear\nGleams, a drop of amber, in the wave.\nTo the strand of the Daughters of the Sunset,\nThe Apple-tree, the singing and the gold;\nWhere the mariner must stay him from his onset,\nAnd the red wave is tranquil as of old;\nYea, beyond that Pillar of the End\nThat Atlas guardeth, would I wend;\nWhere a voice of living waters never ceaseth\nIn God's quiet garden by the sea,\nAnd Earth, the ancient life-giver, increaseth\nJoy among the meadows, like a tree.\nO shallop of Crete, whose milk-white wing\nThrough the swell and the storm-beating,\nBore us thy Prince's daughter,\nWas it well she came from a joyous home\nTo a far King's bridal across the foam?\nWhat joy hath her bridal brought her?\nSure some spell upon either hand\nFlew with thee from the Cretan strand,\nSeeking Athena's tower divine;\nAnd there, where Munychus fronts the brine,\nCrept by the shore-flung cables' line,\nThe curse from the Cretan water!\nAnd for that dark spell that about her clings,\nSick desires of forbidden things\nThe soul of her rend and sever;\nThe bitter tide of calamity\nHath risen above her lips; and she,\nWhere bends she her last endeavour?\nShe will hie her alone to her bridal room,\nAnd a rope swing slow in the rafters' gloom;\nAnd a fair white neck shall creep to the noose,\nA-shudder with dread, yet firm to choose\nThe one strait way for fame, and lose\nThe Love and the pain for ever.\n[ The Voice of the NURSE is heard from within, crying,\nat first inarticulately, then clearly.]\nVOICE\nHelp ho! The Queen! Help, whoso hearkeneth!\nHelp! Theseus' spouse caught in a noose of death!\nA WOMAN\nGod, is it so soon finished? That bright head\nSwinging beneath the rafters! Phaedra dead!\nVOICE\nO haste! This knot about her throat is made\nSo fast! Will no one bring me a swift blade?\nA WOMAN\nSay, friends, what think ye? Should we haste within,\nAnd from her own hand's knotting loose the Queen?\nANOTHER\nNay, are there not men there? 'Tis an ill road\nIn life, to finger at another's load.\nVOICE\nLet it lie straight! Alas! the cold white thing\nThat guards his empty castle for the King!\nA WOMAN\nAh! 'Let it lie straight!' Heard ye what she said?\nNo need for helpers now; the Queen is dead!\n[ The Women, intent upon the voices from the Castle, have not noticed\nthe approach of THESEUS. He enters from the left; his dress and the\ngarland on his head show that he has returned from some oracle or\nspecial abode of a God. He stands for a moment perplexed.]\nTHESEUS\nHo, Women, and what means this loud acclaim\nWithin the house? The vassals' outcry came\nTo smite mine ears far off. It were more meet\nTo fling out wide the Castle gates, and greet\nWith a joy held from God's Presence!\n[ The confusion and horror of the Women's faces gradually affects him.\nA dirge-cry comes from the Castle.]\nHow?\nNot Pittheus? Hath Time struck that hoary brow?\nOld is he, old, I know. But sore it were,\nReturning thus, to find his empty chair!\n[ The Women hesitate; then the Leader comes forward.]\nLEADER\nO Theseus, not on any old man's head\nThis stroke falls. Young and tender is the dead.\nTHESEUS\nYe Gods! One of my children torn from me?\nLEADER\nThy motherless children live, most grievously.\nTHESEUS\nHow sayst thou? What? My wife?...\nSay how she died.\nLEADER\nIn a high death-knot that her own hands tied.\nTHESEUS\nA fit of the old cold anguish? Tell me all—\nThat held her?   Or did some fresh thing befall?\nLEADER\nWe know no more. But now arrived we be,\nTheseus, to mourn for thy calamity.\n[THESEUS stays for a moment silent, and puts his hand on his brow.\nHe notices the wreath.]\nTHESEUS\nWhat? And all garlanded I come to her\nWith flowers, most evil-starred God's-messenger!\nHo, varlets, loose the portal bars; undo\nThe bolts; and let me see the bitter view\nOf her whose death hath brought me to mine own.\n[ The great central door of the Castle is thrown open wide, and the body\nof PHAEDRA is seen lying on a bier, surrounded by a group of\nHandmaids, wailing.]\nTHE HANDMAIDS\nAh me, what thou hast suffered and hast done:\nA deed to wrap this roof in flame!\nWhy was thine hand so strong, thine heart so bold?\nWherefore. O dead in anger, dead in shame,\nThe long, long wrestling ere thy breath was cold?\nO ill-starred Wife,\nWhat brought this blackness over all thy life?\n[ A throng of Men and Women has gradually collected.]\nTHESEUS\nAh me, this is the last\n—Hear, O my countrymen!—and bitterest\nOf Theseus' labours! Fortune all unblest,\nHow hath thine heavy heel across me passed!\nIs it the stain of sins done long ago,\nSome fell God still remembereth,\nThat must so dim and fret my life with death?\nI cannot win to shore; and the waves flow\nAbove mine eyes, to be surmounted not.\nAh wife, sweet wife, what name\nCan fit thine heavy lot?\nGone like a wild bird, like a blowing flame,\nIn one swift gust, where all things are forgot!\nAlas! this misery!\nSure 'tis some stroke of God's great anger rolled\nFrom age to age on me,\nFor some dire sin wrought by dim kings of old.\nLEADER\nSire, this great grief hath come to many an one,\nA true wife lost. Thou art not all alone.\nTHESEUS\nDeep, deep beneath the Earth,\nDark may my dwelling be,\nAnd night my heart's one comrade, in the dearth,\nO Love, of thy most sweet society.\nThis is my death, O Phaedra, more than thine.\n[ He turns suddenly on the Attendants.]\nSpeak who speak can! What was it? What malign\nSwift stroke, O heart discounselled, leapt on thee?\n[ He bends over PHAEDRA; then, as no one speaks looks fiercely up.]\nWhat, will ye speak? Or are they dumb as death,\nThis herd of thralls, my high house harboureth?\n[ There is no answer. He bends again over PHAEDRA.]\nSOME WOMEN\nWoe, woe! God brings to birth\nA new grief here, close on the other's tread!\nMy life hath lost its worth.\nMay all go now with what is finishèd!\nThe castle of my King is overthrown,\nA house no more, a house vanished and gone!\nOTHER WOMEN\nO God, if it may be in any way,\nLet not this house be wrecked! Help us who pray!\nI know not what is here: some unseen thing\nThat shows the Bird of Evil on the wing.\n[THESEUS has read the tablet and breaks out in uncontrollable emotion.]\nTHESEUS\nOh, horror piled on horror!—Here is writ...\nNay, who could bear it, who could speak of it?\nLEADER\nWhat, O my King? If I may hear it, speak!\nTHESEUS\nDoth not the tablet cry aloud, yea, shriek,\nThings not to be forgotten?—Oh, to fly\nAnd hide mine head! No more a man am I.\nGod what ghastly music echoes here!\nLEADER\nHow wild thy voice! Some terrible thing is near.\nTHESEUS\nNo; my lips' gates will hold it back no more;\nThis deadly word,\nThat struggles on the brink and will not o'er,\nYet will not stay unheard.\n[ He raises his hand, to make proclamation to all present.]\nHo, hearken all this land!\n[ The people gather expectantly about him.]\nHippolytus by violence hath laid hand\nOn this my wife, forgetting God's great eye.\n[ Murmurs of amazement and horror; THESEUS, apparently calm,\nraises both arms to heaven. ]\nTherefore, O Thou my Father, hear my cry,\nPoseidon! Thou didst grant me for mine own\nThree prayers; for one of these, slay now my son,\nHippolytus; let him not outlive this day,\nIf true thy promise was! Lo, thus I pray.\nLEADER\nOh, call that wild prayer back! O King, take heed!\nI know that thou wilt live to rue this deed.\nTHESEUS\nIt may not be.—And more, I cast him out\nFrom all my realms. He shall be held about\nBy two great dooms. Or by Poseidon's breath\nHe shall fall swiftly to the house of Death;\nOr wandering, outcast, o'er strange land and sea,\nShall live and drain the cup of misery.\nLEADER\nAh; see! here comes he at the point of need.\nShake off that evil mood, O King; have heed\nFor all thine house and folk—Great Theseus, hear!\n[THESEUS stands silent in fierce gloom.\nHIPPOLYTUS comes in from the right. ]\nHIPPOLYTUS\nFather, I heard thy cry, and sped in fear\nTo help thee, but I see not yet the cause\nThat racked thee so. Say, Father, what it was.\n[ The murmurs in the crowd, the silent gloom of his Father,\nand the horror of the Chorus-women gradually work on HIPPOLYTUS\nand bewilder him. He catches sight of the bier. ]\nAh, what is that! Nay, Father, not the Queen\nDead!\n[ Murmurs in the crowd. ]\n'Tis most strange. 'Tis passing strange, I ween.\n'Twas here I left her. Scarce an hour hath run\nSince here she stood and looked on this same sun.\nWhat is it with her? Wherefore did she die?\n[THESEUS remains silent. The murmurs increase. ]\nFather, to thee I speak. Oh, tell me, why,\nWhy art thou silent? What doth silence know\nOf skill to stem the bitter flood of woe?\nAnd human hearts in sorrow crave the more,\nFor knowledge, though the knowledge grieve them sore.\nIt is not love, to veil thy sorrows in\nFrom one most near to thee, and more than kin.\nTHESEUS ( to himself )\nFond race of men, so striving and so blind,\nTen thousand arts and wisdoms can ye find,\nDesiring all and all imagining:\nBut ne'er have reached nor understood one thing,\nTo make a true heart there where no heart is!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nThat were indeed beyond man's mysteries,\nTo make a false heart true against his will.\nBut why this subtle talk? It likes me ill,\nFather; thy speech runs wild beneath this blow.\nTHESEUS ( as before )\nO would that God had given us here below\nSome test of love, some sifting of the soul,\nTo tell the false and true! Or through the whole\nOf men two voices ran, one true and right,\nThe other as chance willed it; that we might\nConvict the liar by the true man's tone,\nAnd not live duped forever, every one!\nHIPPOLYTUS ( misunderstanding him; then guessing at something\nof the truth )\nWhat? Hath some friend proved false?\nOr in thine ear\nWhispered some slander? Stand I tainted here,\nThough utterly innocent?   [ Murmurs from the crowd.]\nYea, dazed am I;\n'Tis thy words daze me, falling all awry,\nAway from reason, by fell fancies vexed!\nTHESEUS\nO heart of man, what height wilt venture next?\nWhat end comes to thy daring and thy crime?\nFor if with each man's life 'twill higher climb,\nAnd every age break out in blood and lies\nBeyond its fathers, must not God devise\nSome new world far from ours, to hold therein\nSuch brood of all unfaithfulness and sin?\nLook, all, upon this man, my son, his life\nSprung forth from mine! He hath defiled my wife;\nAnd standeth here convicted by the dead,\nA most black villain!\n[HIPPOLYTUS falls back with a cry and covers his face with his robe.]\nNay, hide not thine head!\nPollution, is it? Thee it will not stain.\nLook up, and face thy Father's eyes again!\nThou friend of Gods, of all mankind elect;\nThou the pure heart, by thoughts of ill unflecked!\nI care not for thy boasts. I am not mad,\nTo deem that Gods love best the base and bad.\nNow is thy day! Now vaunt thee; thou so pure,\nNo flesh of life may pass thy lips! Now lure\nFools after thee; call Orpheus King and Lord;\nMake ecstasies and wonders! Thumb thine hoard\nOf ancient scrolls and ghostly mysteries—\nNow thou art caught and known!\nShun men like these,\nI charge ye all! With solemn words they chase\ntheir prey, and in their hearts plot foul disgrace.\nMy wife is dead.—'Ha, so that saves thee now,'\nThat is what grips thee worst, thou caitiff, thou!\nWhat oaths, what subtle words, shall stronger be\nThan this dead hand, to clear the guilt from thee?\n'She hated thee,' thou sayest; 'the bastard born\nIs ever sore and bitter as a thorn\nTo the true brood.'—A sorry bargainer\nIn the ills and goods of life thou makest her,\nIf all her best-beloved she cast away\nTo wreck blind hate on thee!—What, wilt thou say\n'Through every woman's nature one blind strand\nOf passion winds, that men scarce understand?'—\nAre we so different? Know I not the fire\nAnd perilous flood of a young man's desire,\nDesperate as any woman, and as blind,\nWhen Cypris stings? Save that the man behind\nHas all men's strength to aid him. Nay, 'twas thou...\nBut what avail to wrangle with thee now,\nWhen the dead speaks for all to understand,\nA perfect witness!\nHie thee from this land\nTo exile with all speed. Come never more\nTo god-built Athens, not to the utmost shore\nOf any realm where Theseus' arm is strong!\nWhat? Shall I bow my head beneath this wrong,\nAnd cower to thee? Not Isthmian Sinis so\nWill bear men witness that I laid him low,\nNor Skiron's rocks, that share the salt sea's prey,\nGrant that my hand hath weight vile things to slay!\nLEADER\nAlas! whom shall I call of mortal men\nHappy? The highest are cast down again.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nFather, the hot strained fury of thy heart\nIs terrible. Yet, albeit so swift thou art\nOf speech, if all this matter were laid bare,\nSpeech were not then so swift; nay, nor so fair...\n[ Murmurs again in the crowd.]\nI have no skill before a crowd to tell\nMy thoughts. 'Twere best with few, that know me well.—\nNay that is natural; tongues that sound but rude\nIn wise men's ears, speak to the multitude\nWith music.\nNone the less, since there is come\nThis stroke upon me, I must not be dumb,\nBut speak perforce... And there will I begin\nWhere thou beganst, as though to strip my sin\nNaked, and I not speak a word!\nDost see\nThis sunlight and this earth? I swear to thee\nThere dwelleth not in these one man—deny\nAll that thou wilt!—more pure of sin than I.\nTwo things I know on earth: God's worship first;\nNext to win friends about me, few, that thirst\nTo hold them clean of all unrighteousness.\nOur rule doth curse the tempters, and no less\nWho yieldeth to the tempters.—How, thou say'st,\n'Dupes that I jest at?' Nay; I make a jest\nOf no man. I am honest to the end,\nNear or far off, with him I call my friend.\nAnd most in that one thing, where now thy mesh\nWould grip me, stainless quite! No woman's flesh\nHath e'er this body touched. Of all such deed\nNaught wot I, save what things a man may read\nIn pictures or hear spoke; nor am I fain,\nBeing virgin-souled, to read or hear again.\nMy life of innocence moves thee not; so be it.\nShow then what hath seduced me; let me see it.\nWas that poor flesh so passing fair, beyond\nAll woman's loveliness?\nWas I some fond\nFalse plotter, that I schemed to win through her\nThy castle's heirdom? Fond indeed I were!\nNay, a stark madman! 'But a crown,' thou sayest,\n'Usurped, is sweet.' Nay, rather most unblest\nTo all wise-hearted; sweet to fools and them\nWhose eyes are blinded by the diadem.\nIn contests of all valour fain would I\nLead Hellas; but in rank and majesty\nNot lead, but be at ease, with good men near\nTo love me, free to work and not to fear.\nThat brings more joy than any crown or throne.\n[ He sees from the demeanor of THESEUS and of the crowd that his words\nare not winning them, but rather making them bitterer than before.\nIt comes to his lips to speak the whole truth.]\nI have said my say; save one thing...one alone\nO had I here some witness in my need,\nAs I was witness! Could she hear me plead,\nFace me and face the sunlight; well I know,\nOur deeds would search us out for thee, and show\nWho lies!\nBut now, I swear—so hear me both,\nThe Earth beneath and Zeus who Guards the Oath—\nI never touched this woman that was thine!\nNo words could win me to it, nor incline\nMy heart to dream it. May God strike me down,\nNameless and fameless, without home or town,\nAn outcast and a wanderer of the world;\nMay my dead bones rest never, but be hurled\nFrom sea to land, from land to angry sea,\nIf evil is my heart and false to thee!\n[ He waits a moment; but sees that his Father is unmoved.\nThe truth again comes to his lips.]\nIf 'twas some fear that made her cast away\nHer life... I know not. More I must not say.\nRight hath she done when in her was no right;\nAnd Right I follow to mine own despite!\nLEADER\nIt is enough! God's name is witness large,\nAnd thy great oath, to assoil thee of this charge,\nTHESEUS\nIs not the man a juggler and a mage,\nCool wits and one right oath—what more?—to assuage\nSin and the wrath of injured fatherhood!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nAm I so cool? Nay, Father, 'tis thy mood\nThat makes me marvel! By my faith, wert thou\nThe son, and I the sire; and deemed I now\nIn very truth thou hadst my wife assailed,\nI had not exiled thee, nor stood and railed,\nBut lifted once mine arm, and struck thee dead!\nTHESEUS\nThou gentle judge! Thou shalt not so be sped\nTo simple death, nor by thine own decree.\nSwift death is bliss to men in misery.\nFar off, friendless forever, thou shalt drain\nAmid strange cities the last dregs of pain!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWilt verily cast me now beyond thy pale,\nNot wait for Time, the lifter of the veil?\nTHESEUS\nAye, if I could, past Pontus, and the red\nAtlantic marge! So do I hate thine head.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWilt weigh nor oath nor faith nor prophet's word\nTo prove me? Drive me from thy sight unheard?\nTHESEUS\nThis tablet here, that needs no prophet's lot\nTo speak from, tells me all. I ponder not\nThy fowls that fly above us! Let them fly.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nO ye great Gods, wherefore unlock not I\nMy lips, ere yet ye have slain me utterly,\nYe whom I love most? No. It may not be!\nThe one heart that I need I ne'er should gain\nTo trust me. I should break mine oath in vain.\nTHESEUS\nDeath! but he chokes me with his saintly tone!—\nUp, get thee from this land! Begone! Begone!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWhere shall I turn me? Think. To what friend's door\nBetake me, banished on a charge so sore?\nTHESEUS\nWhoso delights to welcome to his hall\nVile ravishers... to guard his hearth withal!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nThou seekst my heart, my tears? Aye, let it be\nThus! I am vile to all men, and to thee!\nTHESEUS\nThere was a time for tears and thought; the time\nEre thou didst up and gird thee to thy crime.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nYe stones, will ye not speak? Ye castle walls!\nBear witness if I be so vile, so false!\nTHESEUS\nAye, fly to voiceless witnesses! Yet here\nA dumb deed speaks against thee, and speaks clear!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nAlas!\nWould I could stand and watch this thing, and see\nMy face, and weep for very pity of me!\nTHESEUS\nFull of thyself, as ever! Not a thought\nFor them that gave thee birth; nay, they are naught!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nO my wronged Mother! O my birth of shame!\nMay none I love e'er bear a bastard's name!\nTHESEUS ( in a sudden blaze of rage )\nUp, thralls, and drag him from my presence! What,\n'Tis but a foreign felon! Heard ye not?\n[ The thralls still hesitate in spite of his fury. ]\nHIPPOLYTUS\nThey touch me at their peril! Thine own hand\nLift, if thou canst, to drive me from the land.\nTHESEUS\nThat will I straight, unless my will be done!\n[HIPPOLYTUS comes close to him and kneels. ]\nNay! Not for thee my pity! Get thee gone!\n[HIPPOLYTUS rises, makes a sign of submission, and slowly moves away.\nTHESEUS,  as soon as he sees him going, turns rapidly and enters the\nCastle.  The door is closed again. HIPPOLYTUS has stopped for a\nmoment before the Statue of ARTEMIS,  and, as THESEUS departs,\nbreaks out in prayer. ]\nHIPPOLYTUS\nSo; it is done! O dark and miserable!\nI see it all, but see not how to tell\nThe tale.—O thou belovèd, Leto's Maid,\nChase-comrade, fellow-rester in the glade,\nLo, I am driven with a caitiff's brand\nForth from great Athens! Fare ye well, O land\nAnd city of old Erechtheus! Thou, Trozên,\nWhat riches of glad youth mine eyes have seen\nIn thy broad plain! Farewell! This is the end;\nThe last word, the last look!\nCome, every friend\nAnd fellow of my youth that still may stay,\nGive me god-speed and cheer me on my way.\nNe'er shall ye see a man more pure of spot\nThan me, though mine own Father loves me not!\n[HIPPOLYTUS goes away to the right, followed by many Huntsmen and other\nyoung men. The rest of the crowd has by this time dispersed, except the\nWomen of the Chorus and some Men of the Chorus of Huntsmen.]\nCHORUS\nMen\nSurely the thought of the Gods hath balm in it alway, to win me\nFar from my griefs; and a thought, deep in the dark of my mind,\nClings to a great Understanding. Yet all the spirit within me\nFaints, when I watch men's deeds matched with the guerdon they find.\nFor Good comes in Evil's traces,\nAnd the Evil the Good replaces;\nAnd Life, 'mid the changing faces,\nWandereth weak and blind.\nWomen\nWhat wilt thou grant me, O God? Lo, this is the prayer of my travail—\nSome well-being; and chance not very bitter thereby;\nSpirit uncrippled by pain; and a mind not deep to unravel\nTruth unseen, nor yet dark with the brand of a lie.\nWith a veering mood to borrow\nIts light from every morrow,\nFair friends and no deep sorrow,\nWell could man live and die!\nMen\nYet my spirit is no more clean,\nAnd the weft of my hope is torn,\nFor the deed of wrong that mine eyes have seen,\nThe lie and the rage and the scorn;\nA Star among men, yea, a Star\nThat in Hellas was bright,\nBy a Father's wrath driven far\nTo the wilds and the night.\nOh, alas for the sands of the shore!\nAlas for the brakes of the hill,\nWhere the wolves shall fear thee no more,\nAnd thy cry to Dictynna is still!\nWomen\nNo more in the yoke of thy car\nShall the colts of Enetia fleet;\nNor Limna's echoes quiver afar\nTo the clatter of galloping feet.\nThe sleepless music of old,\nThat leaped in the lyre,\nCeaseth now, and is cold,\nIn the halls of thy sire.\nThe bowers are discrowned and unladen\nWhere Artemis lay on the lea;\nAnd the love-dream of many a maiden\nLost, in the losing of thee.\nA Maiden\nAnd I, even I,\nFor thy fall, O Friend,\nAmid tears and tears,\nEndure to the end\nOf the empty years,\nOf a life run dry.\nIn vain didst thou bear him,\nThou Mother forlorn!\nYe Gods that did snare him,\nLo, I cast in your faces\nMy hate and my scorn!\nYe love-linkèd Graces,\n(Alas for the day!)\nWas he naught, then, to you,\nThat ye cast him away,\nThe stainless and true,\nFrom the old happy places?\nLEADER\nLook yonder! 'Tis the Prince's man, I ween\nSpeeding toward this gate, most dark of mien.\n[A HENCHMAN enters in haste.]\nHENCHMAN\nYe women, whither shall I go to seek\nKing Theseus? Is he in this dwelling? Speak!\nLEADER\nLo, where he cometh through the Castle gate!\n[THESEUS comes out from the Castle.]\nHENCHMAN\nO King, I bear thee tidings of dire weight\nTo thee, aye, and to every man, I ween,\nFrom Athens to the marches of Trozên.\nTHESEUS\nWhat? Some new stroke hath touched, unknown to me,\nThe sister cities of my sovranty?\nHENCHMAN\nHippolytus is...Nay, not dead; but stark\nOutstretched, a hairsbreadth this side of the dark.\nTHESEUS ( as though unmoved )\nHow slain? Was there some other man, whose wife\nHe had like mine denied, that sought his life?\nHENCHMAN\nHis own wild team destroyed him, and the dire\nCurse of thy lips.\nThe boon of thy great Sire\nIs granted thee, O King, and thy son slain.\nTHESEUS\nYe Gods! And thou, Poseidon! Not in vain\nI called thee Father; thou hast heard my prayer!\nHow did he die? Speak on. How closed the snare\nOf Heaven to slay the shamer of my blood?\nHENCHMAN\n'Twas by the bank of beating sea we stood,\nWe thralls, and decked the steeds, and combed each mane;\nWeeping; for word had come that ne'er again\nThe foot of our Hippolytus should roam\nThis land, but waste in exile by thy doom.\nSo stood we till he came, and in his tone\nNo music now save sorrow's, like our own,\nAnd in his train a concourse without end\nOf many a chase-fellow and many a friend.\nAt last he brushed his sobs away, and spake:\n'Why this fond loitering? I would not break\nMy Father's law—Ho, there! My coursers four\nAnd chariot, quick! This land is mine no more.'\nThereat, be sure, each man of us made speed.\nSwifter than speech we brought them up, each steed\nWell dight and shining, at our Prince's side.\nHe grasped the reins upon the rail: one stride\nAnd there he stood, a perfect charioteer,\nEach foot in its own station set. Then clear\nHis voice rose, and his arms to heaven were spread:\n'O Zeus, if I be false, strike thou me dead!\nBut, dead or living, let my Father see\nOne day, how falsely he hath hated me!'\nEven as he spake, he lifted up the goad\nAnd smote; and the steeds sprang. And down the road\nWe henchmen followed, hard beside the rein,\nEach hand, to speed him, toward the Argive plain\nAnd Epidaurus.\nSo we made our way\nUp toward the desert region, where the bay\nCurls to a promontory near the verge\nOf our Trozên, facing the southward surge\nOf Saron's gulf. Just there an angry sound,\nSlow-swelling, like God's thunder underground\nBroke on us, and we trembled. And the steeds\nPricked their ears skyward, and threw back their heads.\nAnd wonder came on all men, and affright,\nWhence rose that awful voice. And swift our sight\nTurned seaward, down the salt and roaring sand.\nAnd there, above the horizon, seemed to stand\nA wave unearthly, crested in the sky;\nTill Skiron's Cape first vanished from mine eye,\nThen sank the Isthmus hidden, then the rock\nOf Epidaurus. Then it broke, one shock\nAnd roar of gasping sea and spray flung far,\nAnd shoreward swept, where stood the Prince's car.\nThree lines of wave together raced, and, full\nIn the white crest of them, a wild Sea-Bull\nFlung to the shore, a fell and marvellous Thing.\nThe whole land held his voice, and answering\nRoared in each echo. And all we, gazing there,\nGazed seeing not; 'twas more than eyes could bear.\nThen straight upon the team wild terror fell.\nHowbeit, the Prince, cool-eyed and knowing well\nEach changing mood a horse has, gripped the reins\nHard in both hands; then as an oarsman strains\nUp from his bench, so strained he on the thong,\nBack in the chariot swinging. But the young\nWild steeds bit hard the curb, and fled afar;\nNor rein nor guiding hand nor morticed car\nStayed them at all. For when he veered them round,\nAnd aimed their flying feet to grassy ground,\nIn front uprose that Thing, and turned again\nThe four great coursers, terror-mad. But when\nTheir blind rage drove them toward the rocky places,\nSilent and ever nearer to the traces,\nIt followed rockward, till one wheel-edge grazed.\nThe chariot tript and flew, and all was mazed\nIn turmoil. Up went wheel-box with a din,\nWhere the rock jagged, and nave and axle-pin.\nAnd there—the long reins round him—there was he\nDragging, entangled irretrievably.\nA dear head battering at the chariot side,\nSharp rocks, and rippled flesh, and a voice that cried:\n'Stay, stay, O ye who fattened at my stalls,\nDash me not into nothing!—O thou false\nCurse of my Father!—Help! Help, whoso can,\nAn innocent, innocent and stainless man!'\nMany there were that laboured then, I wot,\nTo bear him succour, but could reach him not,\nTill—who knows how?—at last the tangled rein\nUnclasped him, and he fell, some little vein\nOf life still pulsing in him.\nAll beside,\nThe steeds, the hornèd Horror of the Tide,\nHad vanished—who knows where?—in that wild land.\nO King, I am a bondsman of thine hand;\nYet love nor fear nor duty me shall win\nTo say thine innocent son hath died in sin.\nAll women born may hang themselves, for me,\nAnd swing their dying words from every tree\nOn Ida! For I know that he was true!\nLEADER\nO God, so cometh new disaster, new\nDespair! And no escape from what must be!\nTHESEUS\nHate of the man thus stricken lifted me\nAt first to joy at hearing of thy tale;\nBut now, some shame before the Gods, some pale\nPity for mine own blood, hath o'er me come.\nI laugh not, neither weep, at this fell doom.\nHENCHMAN\nHow then? Behoves it bear him here, or how\nBest do thy pleasure?—Speak, Lord. Yet if thou\nWilt mark at all my word, thou wilt not be\nFierce-hearted to thy child in misery.\nTHESEUS\nAye, bring him hither. Let me see the face\nOf him who durst deny my deep disgrace\nAnd his own sin; yea, speak with him, and prove\nHis clear guilt by God's judgments from above.\n[ The HENCHMAN departs to fetch HIPPOLYTUS; THESEUS sits waiting in\nstern gloom, while the CHORUS sing. At the close of their song a\nDivine Figure is seen approaching on a cloud in the air and the voice\nof ARTEMIS speaks.]\nCHORUS\nThou comest to bend the pride\nOf the hearts of God and man,\nCypris; and by thy side,\nIn earth-encircling span,\nHe of the changing plumes,\nThe Wing that the world illumes,\nAs over the leagues of land flies he,\nOver the salt and sounding sea.\nFor mad is the heart of Love,\nAnd gold the gleam of his wing;\nAnd all to the spell thereof\nBend, when he makes his spring;\nAll life that is wild and young\nIn mountain and wave and stream,\nAll that of earth is sprung,\nOr breathes in the red sunbeam;\nYea, and Mankind. O'er all a royal throne,\nCyprian, Cyprian, is thine alone!\nA VOICE FROM THE CLOUD\nO thou that rulest in Aegeus' Hall,\nI charge thee, hearken!\nYea, it is I,\nArtemis, Virgin of God most High.\nThou bitter King, art thou glad withal\nFor thy murdered son?\nFor thine ear bent low to a lying Queen,\nFor thine heart so swift amid things unseen?\nLo, all may see what end thou hast won!\nGo, sink thine head in the waste abyss;\nOr aloft to another world than this,\nBirdwise with wings,\nFly far to thine hiding,\nFar over this blood that clots and clings;\nFor in righteous men and in holy things\nNo rest is thine nor abiding!\n[ The cloud has become stationary in the air. ]\nHear, Theseus, all the story of thy grief!\nVerily, I bring but anguish, not relief;\nYet, 'twas for this I came, to show how high\nAnd clean was thy son's heart, that he may die\nHonoured of men; aye, and to tell no less\nThe frenzy, or in some sort the nobleness,\nOf thy dead wife. One Spirit there is, whom we\nThat know the joy of white virginity,\nMost hate in heaven. She sent her fire to run\nIn Phaedra's veins, so that she loved thy son.\nYet strove she long with love, and in the stress\nFell not, till by her Nurse's craftiness\nBetrayed, who stole, with oaths of secrecy,\nTo entreat thy son. And he, most righteously,\nNor did her will, nor, when thy railing scorn\nBeat on him, broke the oath that he had sworn,\nFor God's sake. And thy Phaedra, panic-eyed,\nWrote a false writ, and slew thy son, and died,\nLying; but thou wast nimble to believe!\n[THESEUS,  at first bewildered, then dumfounded,\nnow utters a deep groan. ]\nIt stings thee, Theseus?—Nay, hear on and grieve\nYet sorer. Wottest thou three prayers were thine\nOf sure fulfilment, from thy Sire divine?\nHast thou no foes about thee, then, that one—\nThou vile King!—must be turned against thy son?\nThe deed was thine. Thy Sea-born Sire but heard\nThe call of prayer, and bowed him to his word.\nBut thou in his eyes and in mine art found\nEvil, who wouldst not think, nor probe, nor sound\nThe deeps of prophet's lore, nor day by day\nLeave Time to search; but swifter than man may,\nLet loose the curse to slay thine innocent son!\nTHESEUS\nO Goddess, let me die!\nARTEMIS\nNay; thou hast done\nA heavy wrong; yet even beyond this ill\nAbides for thee forgiveness. 'Twas the will\nOf Cypris that these evil things should be,\nSating her wrath. And this immutably\nHath Zeus ordained in heaven: no God may thwart\nA God's fixed will; we grieve but stand apart.\nElse, but for fear of the Great Father's blame,\nNever had I to such extreme of shame\nBowed me, be sure, as here to stand and see\nSlain him I loved best of mortality!\nThy fault, O King, its ignorance sunders wide\nFrom very wickedness; and she who died\nBy death the more disarmed thee, making dumb\nThe voice of question. And the storm has come\nMost bitterly of all on thee! Yet I\nHave mine own sorrow, too. When good men die,\nThere is no joy in heaven, albeit our ire\nOn child and house of the evil falls like fire.\n[ A throng is seen approaching; HIPPOLYTUS enters,\nsupported by his attendants. ]\nCHORUS\nLo, it is he! The bright young head\nYet upright there!\nAh the torn flesh and the blood-stained hair;\nAlas for the kindred's trouble!\nIt falls as fire from a God's hand sped,\nTwo deaths, and mourning double.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nAh, pain, pain, pain!\nO unrighteous curse!   O unrighteous sire!\nNo hope.—My head is stabbed with fire,\nAnd a leaping spasm about my brain.\nStay, let me rest. I can no more.\nO fell, fell steeds that my own hand fed,\nHave ye maimed me and slain, that loved me of yore?\n—Soft there, ye thralls!   No trembling hands\nAs ye lift me, now!—Who is that that stands\nAt the right?—Now firm, and with measured tread,\nLift one accursèd and stricken sore\nBy a father's sinning.\nThou, Zeus, dost see me? Yea, it is I;\nThe proud and pure, the server of God,\nThe white and shining in sanctity!\nTo a visible death, to an open sod,\nI walk my ways;\nAnd all the labour of saintly days\nLost, lost, without meaning!\nAh God, it crawls\nThis agony, over me!\nLet be, ye thralls!\nCome, Death, and cover me:\nCome, O thou Healer blest!\nBut a little more,\nAnd my soul is clear,\nAnd the anguish o'er!\nOh, a spear, a spear!\nTo rend my soul to its rest!\nOh, strange, false Curse! Was there some blood-stained head,\nSome father of my line, unpunishèd,\nWhose guilt lived in his kin,\nAnd passed, and slept, till after this long day\nIt lights... Oh, why on me? Me, far away\nAnd innocent of sin?\nO words that cannot save!\nWhen will this breathing end in that last deep\nPain that is painlessness? 'Tis sleep I crave.\nWhen wilt thou bring me sleep,\nThou dark and midnight magic of the grave!\nARTEMIS\nSore-stricken man, bethink thee in this stress,\nThou dost but die for thine own nobleness.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nAh!\nO breath of heavenly fragrance! Though my pain\nBurns, I can feel thee and find rest again.\nThe Goddess Artemis is with me here.\nARTEMIS\nWith thee and loving thee, poor sufferer!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nDost see me, Mistress, nearing my last sleep?\nARTEMIS\nAye, and would weep for thee, if Gods could weep.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWho now shall hunt with thee or hold thy quiver?\nARTEMIS\nHe dies but my love cleaves to him for ever.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nWho guide thy chariot, keep thy shrine-flowers fresh?\nARTEMIS\nThe accursed Cyprian caught him in her mesh!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nThe Cyprian? Now I see it!—Aye, 'twas she.\nARTEMIS\nShe missed her worship, loathed thy chastity!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nThree lives by her one hand! 'Tis all clear now.\nARTEMIS\nYea, three; thy father and his Queen and thou.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nMy father; yea, he too is pitiable!\nARTEMIS\nA plotting Goddess tripped him, and he fell.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nFather, where art thou?... Oh, thou sufferest sore!\nTHESEUS\nEven unto death, child. There is joy no more.\nHIPPOLYTUS\nI pity thee in this coil; aye, more than me.\nTHESEUS\nWould I could lie there dead instead of thee!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nOh, bitter bounty of Poseidon's love!\nTHESEUS\nWould God my lips had never breathed thereof!\nHIPPOLYTUS ( gently )\nNay, thine own rage had slain me then, some wise!\nTHESEUS\nA lying spirit had made blind mine eyes!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nAh me!\nWould that a mortal's curse could reach to God!\nARTEMIS\nLet be! For not, though deep beneath the sod\nThou liest, not unrequited nor unsung\nShall this fell stroke, from Cypris' rancour sprung,\nQuell thee, mine own, the saintly and the true!\nMy hand shall win its vengeance through and through,\nPiercing with flawless shaft what heart soe'er\nOf all men living is most dear to Her.\nYea, and to thee, for this sore travail's sake,\nHonours most high in Trozên will I make;\nFor yokeless maids before their bridal night\nShall shear for thee their tresses; and a rite\nOf honouring tears be thine in ceaseless store;\nAnd virgin's thoughts in music evermore\nTurn toward thee, and praise thee in the Song\nOf Phaedra's far-famed love and thy great wrong.\nO seed of ancient Aegeus, bend thee now\nAnd clasp thy son. Aye, hold and fear not thou!\nNot knowingly hast thou slain him; and man's way,\nWhen Gods send error, needs must fall astray.\nAnd thou, Hippolytus, shrink not from the King,\nThy father. Thou wast born to bear this thing.\nFarewell! I may not watch man's fleeting breath,\nNor strain mine eyes with the effluence of death.\nAnd sure that Terror now is very near.\n[ The cloud slowly rises and floats away.]\nHIPPOLYTUS\nFarewell, farewell, most Blessèd! Lift thee clear\nOf soiling men! Thou wilt not grieve in heaven\nFor my long love!...Father, thou art forgiven.\nIt was Her will. I am not wroth with thee...\nI have obeyed Her all my days!...\nAh me,\nThe dark is drawing down upon mine eyes;\nIt hath me!... Father!... Hold me! Help me rise!\nTHESEUS ( supporting him in his arms )\nAh, woe! How dost thou torture me, my son!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nI see the Great Gates opening. I am gone.\nTHESEUS\nGone? And my hand red-reeking from this thing!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nNay, nay; thou art assoiled of manslaying.\nTHESEUS\nThou leav'st me clear of murder? Sayst thou so?\nHIPPOLYTUS\nYea, by the Virgin of the Stainless Bow!\nTHESEUS\nDear Son! Ah, now I see thy nobleness!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nPray that a true-born child may fill my place.\nTHESEUS\nAh me, thy righteous and god-fearing heart!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nFarewell;\nA long farewell, dear Father, ere we part!\n[THESEUS bends down and embraces him passionately.]\nTHESEUS\nNot yet!—O hope and bear while thou hast breath!\nHIPPOLYTUS\nLo, I have borne my burden. This is death...\nQuick, Father; lay the mantle on my face.\n[THESEUS covers his face with a mantle and rises. ]\nTHESEUS\nYe bounds of Pallas and of Pelops' race,\nWhat greatness have ye lost!\nWoe, woe is me!\nThou Cyprian, long shall I remember thee!\nCHORUS\nOn all this folk, both low and high,\nA grief hath fallen beyond men's fears.\nThere cometh a throbbing of many tears,\nA sound as of waters falling.\nFor when great men die,\nA mighty name and a bitter cry\nRise up from a nation calling.\n[ They move into the Castle, carrying the body of HIPPOLYTUS.]",

    "content":"CHARACTERS\nin order of Appearance\nThe God hermes\nion, Temple Servant of Apollo at Delphi\nchorus, Handmaids of creusa\ncreusa, daughter of Erechtheus, King of Athens\nxuthus, an Achaean of Aeolid race, married to creusa\nan old retainer, devoted slave to creusa\na messenger, Servant of creusa\nthe pythia, or Inspired Prophetess of Delphi\nThe Goddess athena\n[Pg 13   1-18]\nION\nScene: the front of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The God HERMES discovered.\nHermes\nAtlas, whose brazen shoulders hold on high\nThe gods' primaeval home, the vaulted sky,\nBegat, by his divine and only love,\nMaia, who bore to the All-Father Jove\nMe, Hermes, courier to the gods. And, lo,\nToday I am come to Delphi, whence doth flow\nFrom Phoebus, throned above Earth's midmost heart,\nMusic eternal, with prophetic art\nRevealing that which Is or Is To Be.\nThere lives a City, proud in history,\nTrue-named from Pallas of the Spear of Gold,\nWhere Phoebus once in mastering arms did hold\nCreusa, the king's daughter. By the hill\nOf virgin Pallas the god wrought his will,\nWhere northward opening lies a cave they call\nIn Athens the Long Rocks. The maid withal,\nSecret and unsuspected by her sire,\nHeld her womb's burden—so the god's desire\nGuided—until her hour came and she bore\nHer child. Back to that cavern where of yore\nShe had known the god she took him and, arrayed\nFor death, left him to lie. A cradle made\n[Pg 14   19-45]To the ancient rule she laid with him, a round\nCasket, with golden serpents interwound.\nTwas thus to Erichthonius, child of earth,\nAthena gave, as guardians of his birth,\nTwo serpents, and the Aglaurid maidens set\nTo watch his cradle; the rule lingers yet\nIn Athens, round their cradled young to fold\nTwo golden snakes. All that she had of gold\nOr maiden treasures then Creusa gave,\nWeeping, to deck that infant to the grave.\nMeantime my brother Phoebus asked of me\nA brother's service; 'Prithee go,' said he,\n'To Athens and the earth-born race who dwell,\nUnchanging, round our sister's citadel—\nThou know'st the place—there, brother, seek and save\nA babe new-born, laid secret in a cave.\nBring him, his cradle and his tokens, all,\nTo Delphi, and beside my temple wall,\nJust at the entrance, leave him. All beside—\nFor, know, the child is mine—I will provide.'\nI did my brother's will. I bore away\nThe babe with all his tokens and array\nTo Pytho, and left the casket with its lid\nUplifted, that his face might not be hid.\nThe sun's great wheel just then across the sky\nWas mounting, and the Priestess, passing by\nToward the prophetic chamber, chanced to see\nAn infant by the doors. Amazed was she,\nThat any damsel in god's house should dare\nCast down the secret fruit her travail bare,\n[Pg 15   46-68]And first would fain have barred it from the door;\nThen pity stayed her from such harshness, nor\nWould Phoebus see his child so cast away.\nShe took the babe, and reared it to this day,\nNot dreaming that 'twas Phoebus who begot\nThat life, nor of his mother knowing aught;\nNor does the child aught of his parents know.\nPlaying amid the altars, to and fro,\nHis childhood passed, then, as to man he grew,\nThe Delphians made him treasure-guard and true\nSteward of all, and in the sanctuaries\nOf Phoebus still an honoured life is his.\nMeantime Creusa, nurse of this young life,\nAs changing fortunes fell, was given as wife\nTo Xuthus. For in time there chanced to be\nTwixt Athens and the Chalcodontidae,\nWho hold Euboea's isle, an angry swell\nOf war, wherein, since Xuthus shared so well\nThe spear's long toils and eke the victories,\nCreusa's hand was granted as his prize,\nA stranger he, of Zeus-born Aeolus\nBegot, by race Achaean. Wedded thus\nFor long years Xuthus and Creusa stayed\nChildless. And that is why at last they have made\nTheir pilgrim way to Apollo's oracle,\nTo ask god for a child. Aye, Loxias well\nGuideth the car of fortune. He hath not,\nAs men might fancy, his own child forgot.\n[Pg 16   69-91]He means, when Xuthus enters the great hall\nTo give this boy to him and say withal\nHe is truly Xuthus' child. So shall the son\nReturn to his own mother, and be known\nAs hers. So shall Apollo's loves in night\nBe hidden, but the boy possess his right.\nA famous name for him hath Phoebus planned,\nIon, first founder of the Ionian land.\nBut there he comes, out from the temple door,\nThe son of the great god, to sweep the floor\nWith broom of laurel! I will wait to see,\nHid in this myrtle grove, how Fate's decree\nWorks for this strippling, Ion; thus I claim\nFirst of the gods to have spoke his destined name.\n[Exit Hermes. Enter Ion from inside the Temple with a group of Temple Attendants.\nIon\nLo, where the Sun his chariot bright\nAbove the rim of earth hath driven,\nAnd star by star creeps to the night\nFor refuge from the fire of heaven.\nUp on Parnassus' peaks untrod\nIt flashes, and their answering ray\nHails for mankind the circling day,\nAnd fragrant is the dome of God,\nAs wreaths of myrrh their smoke entwine.\nNow is the Virgin of the Shrine\n[Pg 17   92-111]    Mounting in song her mystic throne\nThree-pillared, song that shall impart\nTo Hellas whatso lore unknown\nPhoebus hath whispered to her heart.\nGo, Delphians, servants of our god,\nFirst to Castalia's fount, and lave\nYour bodies in her silvery wave;\nThen only may his floor be trod.\nYour lips let holy silence bless:\nAnd teach the pilgrim hosts who seek\nGod's oracle, no word to speak,\nSaving of joy and holiness.\n[The Attendants disperse; Ion proceeds with his sweeping and sprinkling, and then driving off the Birds.\nI in the service undefiled\nWherein I have laboured from a child,\nWith hallowed wreaths and laurel boughs\nWill clean the entrance ways, and pour\nLibation to make sweet the floor\nOf Lord Apollo's House,\nAnd turn to flight those flocking wings\nOf birds who soil our offerings.\nMotherless and fatherless,\nThis House of God I serve and bless,\nWhich nursed me in my helplessness.\n[Pg 18   112-143]        To work, thou gentle broom of bay\nWho com'st our altar floor to keep!\nGardens immortal gave thee birth,\nWhere, issuing from the heart of earth,\nA stream doth leap,\nTo wash the myrtle and the bay,\nWherewith alway from dawn of day,\nI sweep, I sweep.\nPaian, O Healer mine,\nThou Leto's Son divine,\nAll life, all joy, be thine!\nO happy slavery! 'Tis well,\nLord Phoebus, at thy door to dwell\nAnd bow before thine oracle.\nNo task to mortal man I ply\nOf service, but to One on high\nAnd deathless, nor can I think of shame\nIn toil that bears so great a name.\nThe hand that feedeth me I bless.\nAnd that which gives me happiness\nI name my father: here is He,\nFather and life-giver to me,\nLord Phoebus in his sanctuary.\nPaian, O Healer mine,\nThou Leto's Son divine,\nAll life, all joy, be thine!\n[Pg 19   144-173]\nLo, from the laurel boughs I turn;\nI take me to my golden urn,\nAnd sprinkle earth-born waters, drawn\nFrom eddies deep of Castaly;\nPure is my body in the dawn,\nAnd holy must that water be.\nThus serving Phoebus may I cease\nNever, or but in blessed peace!\nHa! There the birds come flocking down\nFrom old Parnassus, where they haunt.\nAh, perch not on the cornice crown\nNor near the golden house! Avaunt,\nThou herald high of Zeus, begone!\nWilt taste again my arrow's bite,\nGreat eagle, thou whose taloned might\nSurpasseth all? . . . And there, a swan!\nHovering above the altar. Go!\nAway, white wings and crimson feet!\nSmall help will be that music sweet\nMeeting the clang of Phoebus' bow.\nTurn, turn thy wing, and distant make\nThy landing on the Delian Lake.\nObey, or must a blood-stain wrong\nThy sweet-voiced ecstacy of song?\nWhat strange fowl thou, that hoverest\nSo near? Dost think to build below\nOur eaves thy children's grassy nest?\nAh, fear the music of my bow!\n[Pg 20   174-192]        Off to Alpheios' eddying flood\nTo nurse them, or the Isthmian wood!\nNot to be fouled by thee or thine\nAre votive gifts and walls divine.\nTo kill you I have not the heart,\nYou prophets, who to man commend\nThe signs of God. And yet my part\nIs fixed, His Temple to defend.\nHis am I, and shall never be\nFalse to the hand that feedeth me.\n[Ion goes back into the Temple. Enter the Chorus of handmaids visiting the Temple and studying with excitement the scenes on the frieze, Heracles' Labours, Bellerophon slaying the Chimêra, and the War of the Gods and Giants.\nLeader\nNot only Athens, our home divine,\nHath temples then, with an ordered line\nOf pillars, and streets with many a sign\nTo guide through the Holy Places!\nThis House of Loxias Leto-born\nWith eyelid shining accosts the morn\nAnd light from its twofold faces.\nVarious Maidens   [in conversation:\n—Ah, look this way; Look!\n'Tis the Snake of Lerna, shorn\nOf her heads by a golden hook.\n'Tis He, the Alcmêna-born!\n[Pg 21   193-215]        —Here, darling, turn thine eyes.\n—I see.—And to help him hies,\nWith a fire-brand in his hold . . .\nIs it he of whom they told\nThose stories beside my loom?\nArmed Iolaüs, long in use\nTo share alway with the Son of Zeus\nThe Labours of his doom?\n—Ah, and look yonder too.\nYonder, a wondrous deed;\n'Tis one on a wingèd steed\nQuelling that awful thing\nThree-formed, fire-vomiting.\n—All round I turn my view.\n—See ye the wild affray\nIn the Giants' stony lair?\n—Nay, friends, I look this way.\n—Enkelados! Seest him there?\nSeest thou against him wield\nHer gorgon-bordered shield\nSome goddess . . . ?—I see. I see!\nPallas, my own! 'Tis she.\n—And there! The fiery thunder-rod\nTerrific in the hand of God,\nSmiting afar it flies!\nAnd yonder! 'Tis some giant dire\nIn rage that he consumes with fire.\n[Pg 22   216-224]         —I see. 'Tis Mimas!—There again\nAnother Earth-child lieth slain,\nQuelled by the peaceful ivy-rod\nOf mystic Dionyse.\nLeader\n[addressing Ion, as he returns from the Temple.\nThou by the portal, thee I call!\nIs it permitted that we go\nBeyond the threshold: we are all\nBare-footed?\nIon\nNay, stranger maids, it may not be.\nLeader\nMay we even so\nHave speech with thee, and seek to learn . . .\nIon\nWhat is it ye would know or see?\nLeader\nDoth Phoebus' precinct here inurn\nTruly the Earth's mid-navel stone?\nIon\nSurely 'tis here, with garlands tied,\nAnd gorgon heads on either side.\n[Pg 23   225-234]\nLeader\nAye, far that tale hath flown.\nIon\nIf in the forecourt ye have slain\nThe offering due, and now would fain\nPut your own questions to the god,\nPass to the sanctuary within.\nBut without sacrifice of blood\nThe Holy Place ye may not win.\nLeader\nI understand. Nowise\nWould we transgress the rule.\nThat which is here in full\nMeasure will feast our eyes.\nIon\n'Tis lawful; feast your eyes on all.\nLeader\nO'er all Apollo's field to roam\nMy mistress sets me free.\nIon\nAnd what great house doth hold you thrall?\n[Pg 24   235-254]\nLeader\nNeighbour to Pallas is the home\nOf her whose thralls we be.\nBut see who comes. 'Tis she.\n[Enter slowly Creusa; she stands still, gazing at the Temple with tears in her eyes. Ion cannot take his eyes from her.\nIon      [to himself\nWhat nobleness! Thy bearing is a sign,\nThou unknown woman, of a lordly line.\nHow oft in human kind one glance can trace\nBy look and bearing a man's noble race.\nHa! Strange! She gazes at the holy fane\nOf Loxias; then shuts her eyes again,\nAnd all that noble cheek is wet with tears.\nLady, what thoughts have touched thee, or what fears?\nHere, at the god's pure Temple, which to see\nMakes all men glad, thou weepest silently.\nCreusa\nFair youth, I count it no discourteous thing\nTo wonder at these tears and whence they spring.\n'Tis that, on seeing Apollo's dwelling-place,\nMy mind fled off to my own home, to trace\nLines of a far-off wrong . . . Ah, women still\nAre born to suffer, gods to work their will!\nHow else? What help is there, when those who do\nThe wrong that slays us are our judges too?\n[Pg 25   255-266]\nIon\nWhat dark grief, lady, lies on thee so sore?\nCreusa\n'Tis naught, I have shot my arrow, and no more\nWill speak of it. Give thou no thought thereto.\nIon\nWho art thou, and whence journeying? Would I knew\nThy land, and how 'tis meet to speak thy name.\nCreusa\nCreusa, King Erechtheus' child. I claim\nAs birthplace the Athenian citadel.\nIon\nSo noble a city, and so memorable\nA lineage! Truly, high is thy estate.\nCreusa\nSo far, no further, I am fortunate.\nIon\nIs it true, in God's name, as the legends go . . .\nCreusa\nWhat legends, youth? What is it thou wouldst know?\n[Pg 26   267-275]\nIon\nThy father's primal father sprang from earth?\nCreusa\nSmall help to me is Erichthonius' birth.\nIon\nAthena raised him from the furrowed sod?\nCreusa\nWith virgin hands. She knew no motherhood.\nIon\nAnd gave him, by the pictures I have seen . . .\nCreusa\nTo Cecrops' daughters to keep safe, unseen.\nIon\nAnd they, I have heard, the veiling coffer broke?\nCreusa\nAnd died therefor. Their life-blood stained the rock.\nIon\nMarvellous!\nIs this, then, true or just vain fantasy?\n[Pg 27   276-284]\nCreusa\nWhat? Ask thy fill. No business presseth me.\nIon\nThy sire, Erechtheus, his own daughters slew?\nCreusa\nIn sacrifice to save the land; 'tis true.\nIon\nHow came it thou wast slain not with the rest?\nCreusa\nI was a babe, then, at my mother's breast.\nIon\nAnd him the earth yawned and swallowed? Can it be?\nCreusa\nHe sank where struck the trident of the sea . . .\n[A pause\nIon\n'The Long Rocks' is a place there, is it not?\nCreusa\nWhy ask me that? . . . It stirs a sleeping thought.\n[Pg 28   285-293]\nIon\nThe Pythian and his fires fill it with grace.\nCreusa\nGrace?—Would to god I had never seen the place.\nIon\nWhy shrinkest thou from what our god holds dear?\nCreusa\n'Tis naught . . . I know a vile deed plotted there.\nIon\nWhat lord of Athens, lady, won thy hand?\nCreusa\nNone. 'Twas one summoned from an alien land.\nIon\nAlien? Then surely of some royal line.\nCreusa\nXuthus, an Aeolid of race divine.\nIon\nHow could an alien a bride so grand?\n[Pg 29   294-302]\nCreusa\nEuboea's name you know, our neighbour land? . . .\nIon\nThe lapping wave, they say, all round it runs.\nCreusa\nThat isle he conquered, leagued with Athens' sons.\nIon\nA friend in war, who thus became thy lord?\nCreusa\nEven so; my dowry was his spear's reward.\nIon\nIs it with him thou travellest, or alone?\nCreusa\nWith him. But to Trophonius now he is gone.\nIon\nTo see the cave, or seek the oracle?\nCreusa\nTo ask one question, there and here as well.\n[Pg 30   303-311]\nIon\n'Tis fruits of the earth, or children, brings thee here?\nCreusa\nWe are childless still, though married many a year.\nIon\nHast ne'er borne child, ne'er known a mother's stress?\nCreusa\nWell Phoebus knows my utter childlessness.\nIon\nPoor lady!\n'Mid all thy fortune this is misery.\nCreusa\nBut who art thou? Proud must thy mother be.\nIon\nApollo's slave I am called—and rightly called.\nCreusa\nA city's gift? Or by some master sold?\nIon\nThey call me His; no more is known of me.\n[Pg 31   312-321]\nCreusa\nPoor boy! Then I in turn must pity thee.\nIon\nNo mother, nor yet father, have I known.\nCreusa\nThou dwellest here, with no place of thine own?\nIon\nAll God's house; sleeping where sleep falls on me.\nCreusa\nThou camest in boyhood here, or infancy?\nIon\nI was a babe, they say who claim to know.\nCreusa\nSome woman suckled you, who found you so?\nIon\nI knew never the breast. She picked me up.\nCreusa\nWho, poor child? . . . Others then have drunk my cup!\nIon\nThe Prophetess. My only mother she.\n[Pg 32   322-330]\nCreusa\nAnd on to manhood, who supported thee?\nIon\nThe altars feed me, and visitors who pass.\nCreusa\nThy mother has suffered sore, whoe'er she was.\nIon\nSome woman's wrong produced me, I should guess.\nCreusa\nThou hast some wealth? this is no beggar's dress.\nIon\nThralls to the God, his livery we wear.\nCreusa\nDidst never seek to know . . . didst never care?\nIon\nLady, how can I seek? I have no clue.\nCreusa\nAlas!\nMuch the same thing befell a girl I knew.\n[Pg 33   331-340]\nIon\nWho? She might help me. That were happiness.\nCreusa\n'Tis for her sake I have come here . . . husbandless.\nIon\nWhat is thy wish? For service, count on me.\nCreusa\nTo ask the God one question . . . secretly.\nIon\nTell me. I will prepare the oracle.\nCreusa\nHer tale . . . No; 'tis a thing I cannot tell.\nIon\nA vain thing, shame! Thou wilt see no fruit thereof.\nCreusa\nShe says with Phoebus she was joined . . . in love.\nIon\nWith the God! She, a woman! Speak it not.\nCreusa\nAnd bore a secret child, by him begot.\n[Pg 34   341-350]\nIon\nImpossible! . . . 'Tis some man's foul deed she hides.\nCreusa\nBy her tale . . . she hath had more wrong besides.\nIon\nHow . . . if 'tis true that with a God she lay?\nCreusa\nThe babe she bore she hid and put away.\nIon\nExposed? And that child, is he living still?\nCreusa\nWho knows? That I must ask the oracle.\nIon\nIf not alive, how came it by its death?\nCreusa\nPoor baby, torn by wild beasts, so she saith.\nIon\nWild beasts? What reason had she for that thought?\nCreusa\nShe searched where he had lain and found him not.\n[Pg 35   351-360]\nIon\nWere any marks of blood about the place?\nCreusa\nNo. She searched well, she says, but found no trace.\nIon\nSince he thus vanished, how long would it be?\nCruesa\nIf living, he would be a lad like thee.\nIon\nThe god has wronged her, left her to her pain!\nCreusa\nThe woman never has borne child again.\nIon\nDid the god take and rear him as his own?\nCreusa      [Indignantly\nSteal what was hers and make it his alone?\nIon\nHow the tale chimes with my own history!\nCreusa\nFor sure, some mother somewhere pines for thee.\n[Pg 36   361-372]\nIon\nThat grief was half forgotten; let it rest!\nCreusa\nForgive me.—What of my sad friend's request?\nIon\nOne thing makes me despair of helping her.\nCreusa\nIn her whole life what is there but despair?\nIon\nCanst make him speak the thing he seeks to hide?\nCreusa\nShall Truth in Truth's own temple be denied?\nIon\nQuestion him not. Great shame to him it were.\nCreusa\nHis be the shame! 'Tis agony to her.\nIon\nNo man on earth would ask that question. No;\n'Twould be at his own altar-fire to show\nThe god unrighteous. He would surely smite\nA questioner who so misused his right.\n[Pg 37   373-395]Forget thy quest, lady. 'Twould like me ill\nTo use his oracle to thwart his will.\nAnd 'tis to that stark madness we should fall,\nTrying to force the god, in front of all,\nTo show what most he hides, by offerings\nOf slaughtered sheep or signs of fluttering wings.\nBe sure, a gift that gods unwilling give\nItself unwilling comes, and will not live.\nThat only blesseth which is meant to bless.\nLeader\nMan has his multitudes, and grief no less\nHer multitudinous shapes; but who shall find\nOne single cloudless life in all mankind?\nCreusa\nThou god, unrighteous art thou still today\nAs erstwhile to that woman far away\nWhose words are here! Thy son thou couldst have saved;\nAnd wouldst not; nor the knowledge that she craved\nShare with his mother, that if dead she might\nBuild him some tomb, pay him some funeral rite.\nIf living . . . But no more! God will not let\nMe know the thing I crave. I must forget.\nFair youth, I see mine honoured lord, who there\nApproacheth from Trophonius' caverned lair.\nPrithee, no word of this our colloquy.\n'Twould shame me thus to have my secret plea\n[Pg 38   395-413]Discovered; and the matter might be wrought\nFurther, to issues other than I thought.\nAh, hard to tread are woman's ways with men;\nThe true confounded with the false, and then\nAll hated! We are born but to be cursed.\n[Enter Xuthus. He goes straight to the entrance of the shrine. Creusa, much shaken, has time to recover.\nXuthus\nThe god must have my salutation first.\nAll hail, Lord! (Returning) And thou, too, wife. Do I see\nThat my late coming has affrighted thee?\nCreusa\nNot so. It chimed full closely with my thought.\nWhat answer from Trophonius hast thou brought\nWhereby our mating may not fruitless fall?\nXuthus\nThe word of Phoebus he would not forestall,\nBut this he said; that from this journey now\nI shall return not childless . . . no, nor thou!\nCreusa\nO holy mother of Phoebus, blessed be\nThis journey! . . .

Within, 'twill be the care\nOf others round the tripod throned in state,\nHigh Delphians, by the god's lot designate.\nXuthus\nEnough. That gives me all I need to know.\nI had best go straight within. Already, so\nThey tell me, there is held outside the doors\nA general sacrifice for visitors.\nAt once, therefore, the day being favourable,\nI must seek answer from the oracle.\nMeantime, go thou, my wife, with fronds of bay,\nAnd in my name at all the altars pray\nThat fruitful words may meet me from the throne.\nCreusa\nI will, I will. (Exit Xuthus into the Temple) If Loxias will atone\nThat wrong even now . . . he cannot be a friend\nIn full, but I will take what God may send.\n[Exit Creusa out to the Precinct.\nIon\nWhat can the woman mean, her every word\nWith secret cavil charged against our Lord?\nLoves she so much that friend for whom she pleads,\nOr is she holding back some tale that needs\n[Pg 40   432-452]Silence? . . . But why this fond anxiety\nAbout the strange princess? She is naught to me . . .\nWhere are my golden ewers? I must away\nAnd fill the sprinklers for the holy spray.\nBut Phoebus, what possessed him? Aye, and who\nCan chide him? Force a maiden . . . can he do\nSuch deeds? And then forsake her? Propagate\nA child unknown and leave him to his fate!\nNo, no! Ye that have power, seek to pursue\nGoodness. If mortal man does wrong, 'tis you,\nThe gods, who rightly punish him. Shall they\nWho wrote the laws their own laws disobey?\nIf ever—well I know it could not be;\nI play with fancy—if, in equity,\nThou and Poseidon, aye, and Zeus above\nPaid forfeit for your deeds of lawless love,\nThe fines would soon strip all your temples bare.\nUnrighteous, only for your joys ye care,\nNot for wise thought!

I have thee, and thou hast won\nThe ties of home and love, who erst had none.\nBut that upleaping of thy heart: I vow\nI understand. I feel it even as thou.\nThou cravest for thy mother; I too would see\nWhat manner of woman bore this child to me . . .\nBut that can wait. In due time we may well\nFind her. But first, now, bid a long farewell\nTo the god's precinct and this vagabond\nService; come forth, one-hearted with thy fond\nFather, to Athens. Think what waits thee there;\nA father's royal sceptre and a share\nIn wealth abundant. Here thou art forlorn,\nPoor, fatherless; there rich and nobly born.\nArt silent?\nThine eye to earth cast down? Hast fallen to thought,\nSo sudden sad, and our great joy forgot?\nTo see thee flings on me a cloud of fear.\nIon\nThings wear not the same face, when looked at near,\nAs at first sight, far off. Most truly I greet\nWith joy this fortune that hath let me meet\nAt last my Father . . . Yet, give ear to me\nNow, till I open all my mind to thee.\nAthens! A folk born of the soil, not brought\nFrom other lands at all, so I am taught,\n[Pg 54   591-614]Has made that city. Think; should I not bear\nA twofold stain, to come intruding there,\nMy father alien and myself base-born?\nHow should I bear that twofold weight of scorn?\nIf with that shame I rest, ambitionless,\nWhat shall I be? A blank, a nothingness—\nYet, if among the princes of the state\nI claim to sit, shall I not earn much hate\nOf the weaker folk? All power breeds jealousy.\nBesides, many good men, who well might be\nWise leaders, hold their peace and seek no rule\nNor office; such as they would call me fool\nAnd vain, lacking the wisdom to stand clear\nOf conflict in a city racked with fear.\nOthers there are with famous names, who play\nGreat parts in the land's guidance; will not they,\nThe more I rise in power, the keenlier throw\nTheir voice against me? Sure, 'tis always so;\nThose who rule cities, counted patriots great,\nKeep for their rivals their most lively hate.\nAnd then, at home, an alien in your fold,\nForced on a childless woman, who of old\nHad in all fortunes a full share with thee,\nWhich now is lost! Will she not bitterly\nResent her loneliness? Will she not hate—\nAnd with good reason—me, standing in state\nClose to thy throne and smiled on as thy son?\nWill every word not stab that heart, alone\nAnd childless? . . . And thyself, what choice for thee?\nSlight me and look to her? Or else give me\n[Pg 55   615-638]Preferment, and have all the house distraught . . .\nWhat deeds of blood, what poisonings, have been wrought\nBy women on men who wronged them! But apart\nFrom that, father, I pity from my heart\nThy wife, a childless wife, nearing old age.\n'Tis all unmeet that one of heritage\nSo noble by this wrong should be struck down.\nI know men count it great to wear a crown;\nNo, 'tis a fair front, but the house within\nA place of pain. What king hath ever been\nAt peace or happy, striving, amid fears\nAnd sidelong glances, to prolong his years\nUnmurdered? Nay, for joy in common things\nGive me the plain man's circuit, not the king's,\nKings have no friends, save of the baser kind.\nThey hate, from sick fear, those of nobler mind.\n'Gold,' you say, 'outweighs all; a king enjoys\nHis riches.' No; to start at every noise,\nClutching my gold, is not the life for me.\nBetter a low estate from troubles free.\nThink, Father, what good things were round me here.\nFirst, what men reckon beyond all things dear,\nLeisure; then no great turmoil; no base crowd\nTo thrust me from my path. To have some loud\nIll-bred man jostling one is hard to bear.\nRound me were pilgrims whom I led in prayer;\n[Pg 56   639-658]Not men with gloomy faces, but all glad.\nTo those departing on their way I bade\nGod-speed; the newcomers 'twas mine to greet,\nFresh faces alway, which is alway sweet.\nThen, what all pray for, though some like it not,\nAn innocent life, was here my natural lot\nIn the god's service, both by law and by\nMy natural bent. Revolving carefully\nAll these things, better in this quiet shrine\nIs life to me than in that city of thine.\nHere let me live. Man's life can be as sweet\nContent with little as with pride replete.\nLeader\nOh, noble words, if but the bent thereof\nMay help the peace of mind of her I love.\nXuthus\nOh, cease such talk! Learn to be rich and great.\nHere where I found thee, son, I will instate\nOur joint life. First a banquet I will hold,\nThen pay the Birth Rite that was due of old.\nFor thee, I now will treat thee as a guest\nWhom to my house I welcome with a feast\nAnd take with me to Athens. Thou shalt there\nStill be no kin, only a sightseer;\nI would not wound my wife, now left alone\nChildless, with this good fortune of my own.\n[Pg 57   659-675]Later, I will persuade her in thy hand\nTo let my sceptre lie, ruling the land.\nAnd now, since first when from the shrine I came\nI looked on thee, Ion I name thy name.\nSo fortune wills it.\nGather now a throng\nOf thine old comrades here; bring them along\nTo a great feast of oxen slain. 'Twill be\nThy farewell, ere thou leave this land with me.\n[Turning to the Chorus: abruptly.\nYe thralls, of all this tale no word must fly\nAbroad: speak to your mistress and you die!\n[Exit Xuthus.\nIon\nWell, I will go. In this high fortune yet\nIs one thing lacking. If I am ne'er to get\nNearer to her who bare me . . . there is naught\nIn life to live for! To speak all my thought,\nMost would I pray it were a woman born\nIn Athens were my mother. Then no scorn\nWere on me from her side, and speech were free.\nIf in a true-bred land one alien be,\nWhate'er the laws may say, his tongue is still\nA slave's tongue.

Then midway in the tent\nHe stood great mixing bowls, and forth was sent\nA herald who, to full height straining, cried\nThat Delphians all who would should come inside\nAnd share the banquet. When the room was full\nThey crowned them with fresh flowers, and bountiful\nThe feast was. Later, when desire for food\nWas sated, in came that old man, and stood\nAmid the feasters, and much merriment\nHe caused, so busily he came and went,\nCarried the pitchers, poured the hand-water,\nAnd burned sweet incense made with gum of myrrh.\n[Pg 87   1175-1204]Then all the golden goblets he alone\nMust portion—by no orders but his own,\nThen when the time for flutes and loving-cup\nFor all had come, this greybeard lifted up\nHis voice: 'Away with these light bowls,' he said,\n'Bring larger vessels, that our guests be led\nQuicker to mirth.' So men were set to go\nWith silver cups and golden, to and fro,\nCrowding, while he one beaker from the board\nChose out for offering to his new-found lord.\nInto that wine he cast a drop of death\nWhich secretly the Queen—so rumour saith—\nHad given to slay that young life in its joy.\nNo eye had seen it. In his hand the boy\nTook with the rest his cup when, lo, he heard\nSome slave let fall an inauspicious word.\nThe lad being temple-trained, true to his role,\nFeared the bad sign and bade them bring a bowl\nOf untouched wine; meantime out on the floor\nHe poured his draught and bade the others pour.\nSo all stood silent, while we filled those fine\nBeakers with water pure and Byblian wine.\nWhile this was doing, in there burst a flight\nOf sudden pigeons, such as dwell of right\nIn Phoebus' house, and where the wine lay spilled\nThe dry beaks dipped and the soft throats were filled.\nHarmless was that libation to the rest,\nBut one, which lighted where the birthday guest\nHad poured his, while she there her pleasure took . . .\nA-sudden all that feathery form was shook,\n[Pg 88   1205-1228]And widly leapt and screamed with a strange cry\nIncomprehensible. On every eye\nAmazement fell to think what ailed the bird.\nThen in one dying gasp she fell, and stirred\nNo more those roseate feet. Up leapt the young\nFore-destined son, cast off his mantle, flung\nAcross the table his bare arms, and caught\nThe old man with a shout; 'Who was it, sought\nTo kill me? Thine was all the meddling; thine,\nGreybeard, the hand that offered me the wine!\nConfess!' With that he gript the old grey frame\nSearching to find wherefrom the poison came.\nTwas found, and with fierce questioning they broke\nThe old man down, and, telling all, he spoke,\nCreusa's charge and how the drink was planned.\nThen out into the city with his band\nOf feasters went the youth of Phoebus' choice\nAnd 'mid the Lords of Delphi raised his voice:\n'O holy land, Erechtheus' daughter, she\nAn alien here, hath sought to murder me.'\nThe rulers then decreed with one accord,\nSeeing she had slain the servant of the Lord\nOf Delphi, and with blood the sanctuary\nDefiled, our mistress shall be stoned and die.\nNow all the city is set forth to find\nThat woman, on a blind road wandering blind,\nWho came to Phoebus for a child to pray,\nAnd now child, life and all hath cast away.\n[Exit.\n[Pg 89   1229-1251]\nChorus\n—No escape, none.

Where are the torches, where the fires?\nCreusa\nTo rob me, and to steal my father's throne!\nIon\nMy father's gift; the land he had made his own.\nCreusa\nWhat right had the Aeolid in Pallas' land?\n[Pg 94   1298-1307]\nIon\nHe saved it, saved it by his own strong hand.\nCreusa\nA foreign ally is no citizen.\nIon\nFor what I might intend, you killed me, then?\nCreusa\nWhat you intended you would soon have done.\nIon\nChildless, your envy grudged my sire his son.\nCreusa\nIf childless, must I needs have you for heir?\nIon\nIn my own father's wealth have I no share?\nCreusa\nHis shield and spear! Take them! They were his own.\nIon\nOh, leave that altar! From god's seat begone!\nCreusa\nAsk thy lost mother! She may list to thee.\n[Pg 95   1308-1323]\nIon\nThinkst thou to go unpunished, murdering me?\nCreusa\nElse on this altar my spilt blood will lie.\nIon\nWhy seekst thou thus in the god's wreaths to die?\nCreusa\nIf I must suffer, thou shalt suffer too.\nIon\n'Tis strange, these sacred rules; how all untrue\nThe gods have made them, how unreasoning.\nWhy should the guilty have this right to cling\nTo the altar? Cast them out! God's sanctities\nShould never endure the touch of such as these.\nOnly to save the wronged and innocent\nThis refuge in the sanctuaries was meant.\nNot that, if once they reach the sacred place,\nWicked and good are equal in god's grace.\n[Enter from the inner shrine the Pythian Priestess, bearing in her arms an old cradle.\nPythia\nSon, hold thy hand! Behold, I leave my throne\nOf prophecy and pass this threshold stone,\nI, god's own virgin, chosen from all the land\nTo see the laws he made unbroken stand.\n[Pg 96   1324-1332]\nIon\nMother, though not in flesh, mother in love!\nPythia\nAye, call me that. Sweet is the sound thereof.\nIon\nHast heard? This woman planned to murder me.\nPythia\nI heard; nor do I praise thy cruelty.\nIon\nMust I not strike at one who seeks my life?\nPythia\nFierce to the stepson always is the wife.\nIon\nAnd I to stepmothers who poison me.\nPythia\nPeace!\nSeek thine own land. This temple sets thee free.\nIon      [completely yielding.\nI accept thy charge; say all that I must do.\n[Pg 97   1333-1341]\nPythia\nEnter thy home unstained, with omens true.\nIon\nThe hand is clean that slays an open foe.\nPythia\nSuch thoughts are not for thee . . . But mark me now\nIon\nLet me but hear. I know thy loving care.\nPythia\nThou seest what burden in my arms I bear?\nIon\nI see a cradle, old and swathed in bands.\nPythia\nIn this, new-born, thou camest to my hands.\nIon\nHow? This is new; a tale I have never known.\nPythia\nBefore 'twas hid: at last it must be shown.\n[Pg 98   1342-1350]\nIon\nHid all these years! Why was it hid at all?\nPythia\n'Twas His will, here to keep thee his own thrall.\nIon\nAnd now His will is changed? . . . How do we know?\nPythia\nWith thy new father now he bids thee go.\nIon\nWhy was the cradle kept? His charge, or why?\nPythia\nHe put some feeling in my heart that I . . .    [she hesitates.\nIon\nThat thou . . . Speak on. Complete what thou wouldst say.\nPythia\nThat I should keep it safe until this day.\nIon\nWhat bodeth it to me, of ill or good?\n[Pg 99   1351-1363]\nPythia\nIt holds the tokens of thy babyhood.\n[Creusa watches with interest.\nIon\nTokens? Whereby my mother might be sought?\nPythia\nEven so. 'Tis now His will. Before 'twas not.\nIon\nO blessed light! This is a wondrous day!\nPythia\nTake them and seek her. Faint not on thy way.\nIon\nThrough Europe and all Asia till she is mine!\nPythia\nThat thou wilt judge. 'Twas by His will divine\nI reared thee, child; and back to thee I give\nThese vestures which He willed me to receive\nAnd keep, unbidden. Why He willed it so\nI know not. That I have kept them none could know,\nThese long years; none their hiding place could tell.\nAnd now, child, with a mother's love, farewell!    [She turns to go.\n[Pg 100   1364-1383]\nStart on thy quest. Seek first, was there some maid\nOf Delphi, ravished, gave thee birth, and laid\nIn the god's house the burden of her shame;\nIf not, then search all Hellas. In the name\nOf Phoebus, that is the last word shall fall\nFrom me or from the god who hath shared in all!\n[Exit into the Temple.\nIon\nAlas, the tears are wet upon my eyes\nThinking of her, my mother, stealthy-wise\nWedded, who sought to expel me far away\nUnwanted; never on her breast I lay;\nA slave's life, nameless, in god's house I had.\nAh, good the god hath been to me, but bad\nThe ways of Fortune. All the time I should\nHave lived enwrapped in happy babyhood,\nAnd known life's joy, I was cut off, exiled\nFrom that fond life a mother gives her child.\nPoor mother, too! She likewise from the boy\nShe had born cut off, ne'er knew a mother's joy.\nThis cradle it were best, methinks, to take\nInside and to the god an offering make,\nLest, if I find, I find not what I crave.\nThe woman who bore me . . . if she were a slave\n'Twere worse to find her than to let things be.\n[Pg 101   1384-1403]  Lord Phoebus, here in offering to thee . . .\nAnd yet, what is it with me? Would I fight\n'Gainst the god's purpose, who hath brought to light\nHer tokens? Open, then, and see, and dare!\nThe burden Fate ordains I needs must bear . . .\n[He opens the cradle.\nAh, look! The wrapping of the cradle's fold\nBy some strange providence hath grown not old.\nNo mould is on the straps. Yet year on year\nThese things have lain, hoarded and secret here.\nCreusa\nWhat dream is this? What unimagined sign?\nIon\nSilence! We know enough of thee and thine . . .\nCreusa\nMy need will brook no silence. School me not.\nThe casket there—in that I once set out\nIn Cecrops' cavern, in the rock on high . . .\nThee, child! . . . I leave this altar though I die.\n[Moves towards Ion.\nIon\nSeize her. She is god-maddened, and she stands\nClear of the altar's emblems.—Bind her hands!\n[Pg 102   1404-1413]\nCreusa\nOh, hack me! Never falter! I cling fast\nTo this, to thee, and all thy hidden past!\nIon\nShe claims me hers. Such brazenness unknown . . .\nCreusa\nAt last, she who is yours has found her own!\nIon\nHer own? . . . And then you tried to murder me!\nCreusa\nMy child; what more my own could ever be?\nIon\nOh, cease this twisting. I will test your claim.\nCreusa\nLet all be tested. 'Tis at that I aim.\nIon\nIs this urn empty, or has it aught within?\nCreusa\nYour things, the swathings that I wrapped you in.\n[Pg 103   1414-1422]\nIon\nGive them a name while yet unseen they lie.\nCreusa\nThat will I. If I fail thee let me die.\nIon\nSpeak on. . . . Thy daring makes me half afraid.\nCreusa\nThen look. A childish sampler that I made . . .\nIon\nWhat sort of sampler? Many kinds they make\nCreusa\nUnfinished; a child's task for practice sake.\nIon\nWhat pattern has it? I will not be misled.\nCreusa\nIn the mid warp there is a Gorgon's head.\nIon\nO Zeus, what fate is this that tracks us out?\n[Pg 104   1423-1432]\nCreusa\nRinged like an aegis, with snakes coiled about.\nIon\nLook . . .\nHere is it—as one reads an oracle.\nCreusa\nThat old, old childwork, but remembered well!\nIon\nIs there aught else?

    "content":"IPHIGENIA IN AULIS.\nPERSONS REPRESENTED.\nAGAMEMNON.\nOLD MAN.\nMENELAUS.\nACHILLES.\nMESSENGER.\nANOTHER MESSENGER.\nIPHIGENIA.\nCLYTÆMNESTRA.\nCHORUS.\nTHE ARGUMENT.\nWhen the Greeks were detained at Aulis by stress of weather, Calchas declared that they would never reach Troy unless the daughter of Agamemnon, Iphigenia, was sacrificed to Diana. Agamemnon sent for his daughter with this view, but repenting, he dispatched a messenger to prevent Clytæmnestra sending her. The messenger being intercepted by Menelaus, an altercation between the brother chieftains arose, during which Iphigenia, who had been tempted with the expectation of being wedded to Achilles, arrived with her mother. The latter, meeting with Achilles, discovered the deception, and Achilles swore to protect her. But Iphigenia, having determined to die nobly on behalf of the Greeks, was snatched away by the Goddess, and a stag substituted in her place. The Greeks were then enabled to set sail.\nIPHIGENIA IN AULIS.\nAGAMEMNON. Come before this dwelling, O aged man.\nOLD MAN. I come. But what new thing dost thou meditate, king Agamemnon?\nAG. You shall learn.[1]\nOLD M. I hasten. My old age is very sleepless, and sits wakeful upon mine eyes.\nAG. What star can this be that traverses this way?\nOLD M. Sirius, flitting yet midway (between the heavens and the ocean,)[2] close to the seven Pleiads.\nAG. No longer therefore is there the sound either of birds or of the sea, but silence of the winds reigns about this Euripus.\nOLD M. But why art thou hastening without the tent, king Agamemnon? But still there is silence here by Aulis, and the guards of the fortifications are undisturbed. Let us go within.\nAG. I envy thee, old man, and I envy that man who has passed through a life without danger, unknown, unglorious; but I less envy those in honor.\nOLD M. And yet 'tis in this that the glory of life is.\nAG. But this very glory is uncertain, for the love of popularity is pleasant indeed, but hurts when present. Sometimes the worship of the Gods not rightly conducted upturns one's life, and sometimes the many and dissatisfied opinions of men harass.\nOLD M. I praise not these remarks in a chieftain. O Agamemnon, Atreus did not beget thee upon a condition of complete good fortune.[3] But thou needs must rejoice and grieve; [in turn,] for thou art a mortal born, and even though you wish it not, the will of the Gods will be thus. But thou, opening the light of a lamp, art both writing this letter, which thou still art carrying in thy hands, and again you blot out the same characters, and seal, and loose again, and cast the tablet to the ground, pouring abundant tears, and thou lackest naught of the unwonted things that tend to madness. Why art thou troubled, why art thou troubled? What new thing, what new thing [has happened] concerning thee, O king? Come, communicate discourse with me. But thou wilt speak to a good and faithful man, for to thy wife Tyndarus sent me once on a time, as a dower-gift, and disinterested companion.[4]\nAG. To Leda, daughter of Thestias, were born three virgins, Phœbe, and Clytæmnestra my spouse, and Helen. Of this latter, the youths of Greece that were in the first state of prosperity came as suitors. But terrible threats of bloodshed[5] arose against one another, from whoever should not obtain the virgin. But the matter was difficult for her father Tyndarus, whether to give, or not to give [her in marriage,] and how he might best deal with the circumstances, when this occurred to him; that the suitors should join oaths and plight right hands with one another, and over burnt-offerings should enter into treaty, and bind themselves by this oath, 'Of whomsoever the daughter of Tyndarus shall become wife, that they will join to assist him, if any one should depart from his house taking [her] with him, and excluding the possessor from his bed, and that they will make an expedition in arms, and sack the city [of the ravisher,] Greek or barbarian alike.' But after they had pledged themselves, the old man Tyndarus somehow cleverly overreached them by a cunning plan. He permits his daughter to choose one of the suitors, toward whom the friendly gales of Venus might impel her. But she chose (whom would she had never taken!) Menelaus. And he who, according to the story told by men, once judged the Goddesses, coming from Phrygia to Lacedæmon, flowered in the vesture of his garments, and glittering with gold, barbarian finery, loving Helen who loved him, he stole and bore her away to the bull-stalls of Ida, having found Menelaus abroad. But he, goaded hastily[6] through Greece, calls to witness the old oath given to Tyndarus, that it behooves to assist the aggrieved. Henceforth the Greeks hastening with the spear, having taken their arms, come to this Aulis with its narrow straits, with ships and shields together, and accoutred with many horses and chariots. And they chose me general of the host, out of regard for Menelaus, being his brother forsooth. And would that some other than I had obtained the dignity. But when the army was assembled and levied, we sat, having no power of sailing, at Aulis. But Calchas the seer proclaimed to us, being at a loss, that we should sacrifice Iphigenia, whom I begat, to Diana, who inhabits this place, and that if we sacrificed her, we should have both our voyage, and the sacking of Troy, but that this should not befall us if we did not sacrifice her. But I hearing this in rousing proclamation, bade Talthybius dismiss the whole army, as I should never have the heart to slay my daughter. Upon this, indeed, my brother, alleging every kind of reasoning, persuaded me to dare the dreadful deed, and having written in the folds of a letter, I sent word to my wife to send her daughter as if to be married to Achilles, both enlarging on the dignity of the man, and asserting that he would not sail with the Greeks, unless a wife for him from among us should come to Phthia. For I had this means of persuading my wife, having made up a pretended match for the virgin. But we alone of the Greeks know how these matters are, Calchas, Ulysses, and Nestor. But the things which I then determined not well, I am now differently writing so as to be well, in this letter, which by the shadow of night thou beheldest me opening and closing, old man. But come, go thou, taking these letters, to Argos. But as to what the letter conceals in its folds, I will tell thee in words all that is written therein; for thou art faithful to my wife and house.\nOLD M. Speak, and tell me, that with my tongue I may also say what agrees with your letter.\nAG. (reading) 'I send to thee, O germ of Leda, besides[7] my former dispatches, not to send thy daughter to the bay-like wing of Eubœa,[8] waveless Aulis. For we will delay the bridals of our daughter till another season.'\nOLD M. And how will not Achilles raise up his temper against thee and thy wife, showing great wrath at failing of his spouse? This also is terrible. Show what thou meanest.\nAG. Achilles, furnishing the pretext, not the reality, knows not these nuptials, nor what we are doing; nor that I have professed to give my daughter into the nuptial chain of his arms by marriage.[9]\nOLD M. Thou venturest terrible things, king Agamemnon, who, having promised thy daughter as wife to the son of the Goddess, dost lead her as a sacrifice on behalf of the Greeks.\nAG. Ah me! I was out of my senses. Alas! And I am falling into calamity. But go, plying thy foot, yielding naught to old age.\nOLD M. I hasten, O king.\nAG. Do not thou either sit down by the woody fountains, nor repose in sleep.\nOLD M. Speak good words.\nAG. But every where as you pass the double track, look about, watching lest there escape thee a chariot passing with swift wheels, bearing my daughter hither to the ships of the Greeks.\nOLD M. This shall be.\nAG. And go out of the gates[10] quickly,† for if you meet with the procession,† again go forth, shake the reins, going to the temples reared by the Cyclops.\nOLD M. But tell me, how, saying this, I shall obtain belief from thy daughter and wife.\nAG. Preserve the seal, this which thou bearest on this letter. Go: morn, already dawning forth this light, grows white, and the fire of the sun's four steeds. Aid me in my toils. But no one of mortals is prosperous or blest to the last, for none hath yet been born free from pain.\nCHORUS. I came to the sands of the shore of marine Aulis, having sailed through the waves of Euripus, quitting Chalcis with its narrow strait, my city, the nurse of the sea-neighboring waters[11] of renowned Arethusa, in order that I might behold the army of the Greeks, and the ship-conveying oars of the Grecian youths, whom against Troy in a thousand ships of fir, our husbands say that yellow-haired Menelaus and Agamemnon of noble birth, are leading in quest of Helen,[12] whom the herdsman Paris bore from reed-nourishing Eurotas, a gift of Venus, when at the fountain dews Venus held contest, contest respecting beauty with Juno and Pallas. But I came swiftly through the wood of Diana with its many sacrifices, making my cheek red with youthful modesty, wishing to behold the defense of the shield, and the arm-bearing tents[13] of the Greeks, and the crowd of steeds. But I saw the two Ajaces companions, the son of Oileus, and the son of Telamon, the glory of Salamis, and Protesilaus and Palamedes, whom the daughter of Neptune bore, diverting themselves[14] with the complicated figures of draughts, and Diomede rejoicing in the pleasures of the disk, and by them Merione, the blossom of Mars, a marvel to mortals, and the son of Laertes from the mountains of the isle, and with them Nireus, fairest of the Greeks, and Achilles, tempest-like in the course, fleet as the winds, whom Thetis bore, and Chiron trained up, I beheld him on the shore, coursing in arms along the shingles. And he toiled through a contest of feet, running against a chariot of four steeds for victory. But the charioteer cried out, Eumelus, the grandson of Pheres,[15] whose most beauteous steeds I beheld, decked out with gold-tricked bits, hurried on by the lash, the middle ones in yoke dappled with white-spotted hair, but those outside, in loose harness, running contrariwise in the bendings of the course, bays, with dappled skins under their legs with solid hoofs. Close by which Pelides was running in arms, by the orb and wheels of the chariot.[16] And I came to the multitude of ships, a sight not to be described, that I might satiate the sight of my woman's eyes, a sweet delight. And at the right horn [of the fleet] was the Phthiotic army of the Myrmidons, with fifty valiant ships. And in golden effigies the Nereid Goddesses stood on the summit of the poops, the standard of the host of Achilles. And next to these there stood the Argive ships, with equal number of oars, of which [Euryalus] the grandson of Mecisteus was general, whom his father Talaus trains up, and Sthenelus son of Capaneus. But [Acamas] son of Theseus, leading sixty ships from Athens, kept station, having the Goddess Pallas placed[17] in her equestrian winged chariot, a prosperous sign to sailors. But I beheld the armament of the Bœotians, fifty sea-bound ships, with signs at the figure-heads, and their sign was Cadmus, holding a golden dragon, at the beaks of the ships, and Leitus the earth-born was leader of the naval armament, and [I beheld] those from the Phocian land. But the son of Oileus, leading an equal number of Locrian ships, came, having left the Thronian city. But from Cyclopian Mycenæ the son of Atreus sent the assembled mariners of a hundred ships. And with him was Adrastus, as friend with friend, in order that Greece might wreak vengeance on those who fled their homes, for the sake of barbarian nuptials. But from Pylos we beheld on the poops of Gerenian Nestor, a sign bull-footed to view, his neighbor Alpheus. But there were twelve beaks of Ænian ships, which king Gyneus led, and near these again the chieftains of Elis, whom all the people named Epeians, and o'er these Eurytus had power. But the white-oared Taphian host * * * * led,[18] which Meges ruled, the offspring of Phyleus, leaving the island Echinades, inaccessible to sailors. And Ajax, the foster-child of Salamis, joined the right horn to the left, to which he was stationed nearest, joining them with his furthermost ships, with twelve most swift vessels, as I heard, and beheld the naval people. To which if any one add the barbarian barks, * * * * it will not obtain a return. * * * * Where I beheld the naval expedition, but hearing other things at home I preserve remembrance of the assembled army.\nOLD M. Menelaus, thou art daring dreadful deeds thou shouldst not dare.\nMENELAUS. Away with thee! thou art too faithful to thy masters.\nOLD M. An honorable rebuke thou hast rebuked me with!\nMEN. To thy cost shall it be, if thou dost that thou shouldst not do.\nOLD M. You have no right to open the letter which I was carrying.\nMEN. Nor shouldst thou bear ills to all the Greeks.\nOLD M. Contest this point with others, but give up this [letter] to me.\nMEN. I will not let it go.\nOLD M. Nor will I let it go.\nMEN. Then quickly with my sceptre will I make thine head bloody.\nOLD M. But glorious it is to die for one's masters.\nMEN. Let go. Being a slave, thou speakest too many words.\nOLD M. O master, I am wronged, and this man, having snatched thy letter out of my hands, O Agamemnon, is unwilling to act rightly.\nMEN. Ah! what is this tumult and disorder of words?\nOLD M. My words, not his, are fittest to speak.[19]\nAG. But wherefore, Menelaus, dost thou come to strife with this man and art dragging him by force?\nMEN. Look at me, that I may take this commencement of my speech.\nAG. What, shall I through fear not open mine eyelids, being born of Atreus?\nMEN. Seest thou this letter, the minister of writings most vile?\nAG. I see it, and do thou first let it go from thy hands.\nMEN. Not, at least, before I show to the Greeks what is written therein.\nAG. What, knowest thou what 'tis unseasonable thou shouldst know, having broken the seal?\nMEN. Ay, so as to pain thee, having unfolded the ills thou hast wrought privily.\nAG. But where didst thou obtain it? O Gods, for thy shameless heart!\nMEN. Expecting thy daughter from Argos, whether she will come to the army.\nAG. What behooves thee to keep watch upon my affairs? Is not this the act of a shameless man?\nMEN. Because the will [to do so] teased me, and I am not born thy slave.\nAG. Is it not dreadful? Shall I not be suffered to be master of my own family?\nMEN. For thou thinkest inconsistently, now one thing, before another, another thing presently.\nAG. Well hast thou talked evil. Hateful is a too clever tongue.[20]\nMEN. But an unstable mind is an unjust thing to possess, and not clear[21] for friends. I wish to expostulate with thee, but do not thou in wrath turn away from the truth, nor will I speak overlong. Thou knowest when thou wast making interest to be leader of the Greeks against Troy—in seeming indeed not wishing it, but wishing it in will—how humble thou wast, taking hold of every right hand, and keeping open doors to any of the people that wished, and giving audience to all in turn even if one wished it not, seeking by manners to purchase popularity among the multitude. But when you obtained the power, changing to different manners, you were no longer the same friend as before to your old friends, difficult of access,[22] and rarely within doors. But it behooves not a man who has met with great fortune to change his manners, but then chiefly to be firm toward his friends, when he is best able to benefit them, being prosperous. I have first gone over these charges against thee, in which I first found thee base. But when thou afterward camest into Aulis and to the army of all the Greeks, thou wast naught, but wast in stupefaction at the fortune which then befell us from the Gods, lacking a favorable breeze for the journey. But the Greeks demanded that you should dismiss the ships, and not toil vainly at Aulis. But how cheerless and distressed a countenance you wore, because you were not able to land your army at Priam's land, having a thousand ships under command.[23] And thou besoughtest me, 'What shall I do?' 'But what resource shall I find from whence?' so that thou mightest not lose an ill renown, being deprived of the command. And then, when Calchas o'er the victims said that thou must sacrifice thy daughter to Diana, and that there would [then] be means of sailing for the Greeks, delighted in heart, you gladly promised to sacrifice your child, and of your own accord, not by compulsion—do not say so—you send to your wife to convoy your daughter hither, on a pretext of being wedded to Achilles. And then changing [your mind] you are caught altering to other writings, to the effect that you will not now be the slayer of your daughter. Very pretty, forsooth! This is the same air which heard these very protestations from thee. But innumerable men experience this in their affairs; they persevere in labor when in power,[24] and then make a bad result, sometimes through the foolish mind of the citizens, but sometimes with reason, themselves becoming incapable of preserving the state, I indeed chiefly groan for hapless Greece, who, wishing to work some doughty deed against these good-for-nothing barbarians, will let them, laughing at us, slip through her hands, on account of thee and thy daughter. I would not make any one ruler of the land for the sake of necessity,[25] nor chieftain of armed men. It behooves the general of the state to possess sense, for every man is a ruler who possesses sense.\nCHOR. 'Tis dreadful for words and strife to happen between brothers, when they fall into dispute.\nAG. I wish to address thee in evil terms, but mildly,[26] in brief, not uplifting mine eyelids too much aloft through insolence, but moderately, as being my brother. For a good man is wont to show respect [to others.] Tell me, why dost thou burst forth thus violently, having thy face suffused with rage? Who wrongs thee? What lackest thou? Wouldst fain gain a good wife! I can not supply thee, for thou didst ill rule over the one you possessed. Must I therefore pay the penalty of your mismanagement, who have made no mistake? Or does my ambition annoy thee? But wouldst thou fain hold in thine arms a fair woman, forgetting discretion and honor? Evil pleasures belong to an evil man. But if I, having before resolved ill, have changed to good counsel, am I mad? Rather art thou [mad,] who, having lost a bad wife, desirest to recover her, when God has well prospered thy fortune. The nuptial-craving suitors in their folly swore the oath to Tyndarus, but hope, I ween, was their God, and wrought this more than thyself and thy strength. Whom taking[27] make thou the expedition, but I think thou wilt know [that it is] through the folly of their hearts, for the divinity is not ignorant, but is capable of discerning oaths ill plighted and perforce. But I will not slay my children, so that thy state will in justice be well, revenge upon the worst of wives, but nights and days will waste me away in tears, having wrought lawless, unjust deeds against the children whom I begat. These words are briefly spoken to thee, both plain and easy, but if thou art unwilling to be wise, I will arrange my own affairs well.\nCHOR. These words are different from those before spoken, but they are to a good effect, that the children be spared.\nMEN. Alas! alas! have I then wretched no friends?\nAG. [Yes, you have,] at least, if you do not wish to ruin your friends.\nMEN. But how will you show that you are born of the same sire with me?\nAG. I am born to be wise with you, not foolish.[28]\nMEN. It behooves friends to grieve in common with friends.\nAG. Admonish me by well doing, not by paining me.\nMEN. Dost thou not then think fit to toil through this with Greece?\nAG. But Greece, with thee, is sickening through some deity.\nMEN. Vaunt then on thy sceptre, having betrayed thy brother. But I will seek some other schemes, and other friends.\n[Enter a Messenger.[29]]\nMESSENGER. O Agamemnon, king of all the Greeks, I am come, bringing thy daughter to thee, whom thou didst name Iphigenia in thy palace. But her mother follows, the person of thy [wife] Clytæmnestra, and the boy Orestes, that thou mayest be pleased at the sight, being away from thine home a long season. But as they have come a long way, they and their mares are refreshing their female feet by the fair-flowing fountain, and we let loose the mares in a grassy meadow, that they might taste fodder. But I am come before them to prepare you [for their reception,] for a swift report passed through the army, that thy daughter had arrived. And all the multitude comes out hastily to the spectacle, that they may behold thy child. For prosperous men are renowned and conspicuous among all mortals. And they say, 'Is there a marriage on foot? or what is going on?' Or, 'Has king Agamemnon, having a yearning after his daughter, brought his child hither?' But from some you would have heard this: 'They are initiating[30] the damsel in honor of Artemis, queen of Aulis, who will marry her.' But come, get ready the baskets,[31] which come next, crown thine head. And do thou, king Menelaus, prepare a nuptial lay, and through the house let the pipe sound and let there be noise of feet, for this day comes blessed upon the virgin.\nAG. I commend [your words,] but go thou within the house, and it shall be well, as fortune takes its course. Alas! what shall I wretched say? Whence shall I begin? Into what fetters of necessity have I fallen! Fortune has upturned me, so as to become far too clever for my cleverness. But lowness of birth has some advantage thus. For such persons are at liberty to weep, and speak unhappy words, but to him that is of noble birth, all these things belong. We have our dignity as ruler of our life, and are slaves to the multitude. For I am ashamed indeed to let fall the tear, yet again wretched am I ashamed not to weep, having come into the greatest calamities. Well! what shall I say to my wife? How shall I receive her? What manner of countenance shall I present? And truly she hath undone me, coming uncalled amidst the ills which before possessed me. And with reason did she follow her daughter, being about to deck her as a bride,[32] and to perform the dearest offices, where she will find us base. But for this hapless virgin—why [call her] virgin? Hades, as it seems, will speedily attend on her nuptials,—how do I pity her! For I think that she will beseech me thus: O father, wilt thou slay me? Such a wedding mayest thou thyself wed, and whosoever is a friend to thee. But Orestes being present will cry out knowingly words not knowing, for he is yet an infant. Alas! how has Priam's son, Paris, undone me by wedding the nuptials of Paris, who has wrought this!\nCHOR. And I also pity her, as it becomes a stranger woman to moan for the misfortune of her lords.\nMEN. Brother, give me thy right hand to touch.\nAG. I give it, for thine is the power, but I am wretched.\nMEN. I swear by Pelops, who was called the sire of my father and thine, and my father Atreus, that I indeed will tell thee plainly from my heart, and not any thing out of contrivance, but only what I think. I, beholding thee letting fall the tear from thine eyes, pitied thee, and myself let fall [a tear] for thee in return. And I have changed[33] my old determinations, not being wrath against you, but I will place myself in your present situation, and I recommend you neither to slay your child, nor to take my part; for it is not just that thou shouldst groan, but my affairs be in a pleasant state, and that thine should die, but mine behold the light. For what do I wish? Might I not obtain another choice alliance, if I crave nuptials? But, having undone my brother, whom it least behooved me, shall I receive Helen, an evil in place of a good? I was foolish and young, before that, viewing the matter closely, I saw what it is to beget children. Besides, pity came over me, considering our connection, for the hapless girl, who is about to be sacrificed because of my marriage. But what has thy virgin [daughter] to do with Helen? Let the army go, being disbanded from Aulis. But cease thou bedewing thine eyes with tears, my brother, and exciting me to tears. But if I have any concern in the oracle respecting thy daughter, let me have none: to thee I yield my part. But I have come to a change[34] from terrible resolutions. I have experienced[35] what was meet. I have changed to regard him who is sprung from a common source. Such changes belong not to a bad man, [viz.] to follow the best always.\nCHOR. Thou hast spoken generous words, and becoming Tantalus the son of Jove. Thou disgracest not thine ancestors.\nAG. I commend thee, Menelaus, in that, contrary to my expectation, you have subjoined these words, rightly, and worthily of thee.\nMEN. A certain disturbance[36] between brothers arises on account of love, and avarice in their houses. I abhor such a relationship, mutually sore.\nAG. But [consider,] for we are come into circumstances that render it necessary to accomplish the bloody slaughter of my daughter.\nMEN. How? Who will compel thee to slay thy child?\nAG. The whole assembly of the armament of the Greeks.\nMEN. Not so, if at least thou dismiss it back to Argos.\nAG. In this matter I might escape discovery, but in that I can not.[37]\nMEN. What? One should not too much fear the multitude.\nAG. Calchas will proclaim his prophecy to the army of the Greeks.\nMEN. Not if he die first—and this is easy.\nAG. The whole race of seers is an ambitious ill.\nMEN. And in naught good or profitable, when at hand.[38]\nAG. But dost thou not fear that which occurs to me?\nMEN. How can I understand the word you say not?\nAG. The son of Sisyphus knows all these matters.\nMEN. It can not be that Orestes can pain thee and me.\nAG. He is ever changeable, and with the multitude.\nMEN. He is indeed possessed with the passion for popularity, a dreadful evil.\nAG. Do you not then think that he, standing in the midst of the Greeks, will tell the oracles which Calchas pronounced, and of me, that I promised to offer a sacrifice to Diana, and then break my word. With which [words] having carried away the army, he will bid the Greeks slay thee and me, and sacrifice the damsel. And if I flee to Argos, they will come and ravage and raze the land, Cyclopean walls and all. Such are my troubles. O unhappy me! How, by the Gods, am I at a loss in these present matters! Take care of one thing for me, Menelaus, going through the army, that Clytæmnestra may not learn these matters, before I take and offer my daughter to Hades, that I may fare ill with as few tears as possible. But do ye, O stranger women, preserve silence.\nCHORUS. Blest are they who share the nuptial bed of the Goddess Aphrodite,[39] when she is moderate, and with modesty, obtaining a calm from the maddening stings, when Love with his golden locks stretches his twin bow of graces, the one for a prosperous fate, the other for the upturning of life. I deprecate this [bow,] O fairest Venus, from our beds, but may mine be a moderate grace, and holy endearments, and may I share Aphrodite, but reject her when excessive. But the natures of mortals are different, and their manners are different,[40] but that which is clearly good is ever plain. And the education which trains[41] [men] up, conduces greatly to virtue, for to have reverence is wisdom, and it possesses an equivalent advantage, viz. to perceive what is fitting by one's mind, where report bears unwasting glory to life.[42] 'Tis a great thing to hunt for [the praise of] virtue, among women indeed, by a secret affection,[43] but among men, on the other hand, honor being inherent,[44] [bears that praise, honor,] which increases a state to an incalculable extent.[45]\nThou earnest, O Paris, †where thou wast trained up a shepherd with the white heifers of Ida, trilling a barbarian lay, breathing an imitation of the Phrygian pipes of Olympus on a reed. And the cows with their well-filled udders browsed, when the judgment of the Goddesses drove thee mad, which sends thee into Greece,† before the ivory-decked palaces, thou who didst strike love into the eyes of Helen which were upon thee, and thyself wast fluttered with love. Whence strife, strife brings Greece against the bulwarks of Troy with spears and ships.† Alas! alas! great are the fortunes of the great.[46] Behold the king's daughter, Iphigenia, my queen, and Clytæmnestra, daughter of Tyndarus, how are they sprung from the great, and to what suitable fortune they are come. The powerful, in sooth, and the wealthy, are Gods to those of mortals who are unblest. [Let us stand still, ye children of Chalcis, let us receive the queen from her chariot to the earth, not unsteadily, but gently with the soft attention of our hands, lest the renowned daughter of Agamemnon, newly coming to me, be alarmed, nor let us, as strangers to strangers, cause disturbance or fear to the Argive ladies.[47]]\n[Enter Clytæmnestra, IPHIGENIA, and probably ORESTES in a chariot. They descend from it, while the Chorus make obeisance.]\nCLY. I regard both your kindness and your favorable words as a good omen, and I have some hope that I am here as escort [of my daughter] to honorable nuptials. But take out of my chariot the dower-gifts which I bear for my girl, and send them carefully into the house. And do thou, my child, quit the horse-chariot, setting [carefully] thy foot delicate and at the same time tender. But you,[48] maidens, receive her in your arms, and lift her from the chariot. And let some one give me the firm support of his hand, that I may beseemingly leave the chariot-seat. But do some[49] of you stand in front of the horses' yoke, for the uncontrolled eye of horses is timorous, and take this boy, the son of Agamemnon, Orestes, for he is still an infant. Child! dost sleep, overcome by the ride? Wake up happily for thy sisters' nuptials. For thou thyself being noble shalt obtain relationship with a good man, the God-like son of the daughter of Nereus. [[50]Next come thou close to my foot, O daughter, to thy mother, Iphigenia, and standing near, show these strangers how happy I am, and come hither indeed, and address thy dear father.] O thou most great glory to me, king Agamemnon, we are come, not disobeying thy bidding.\nIPH. O mother, running indeed, (but be thou not angry,) I will apply my breast to my father's breast. [[51]But I wish, rushing to embrace thy breast, O father, after a long season. For I long for thy face. But do not be angry.]\nCLY. But, O my child, enjoy [thine embraces,] but thou wert ever most fond of thy father, of all the children I bore.\nIPH. O father, joyous do I behold thee after a long season.\nAG. And I, thy father, [joyously behold] thee. Thou speakest thus equally in respect to both.\nIPH. Hail! But well hast thou done in bringing me to thee, O father.\nAG. I know not how I shall say, yet not say so, my child.\nIPH. Ah! how uneasily dost thou regard me, joyfully beholding me [before.]\nAG. A king and general has many cares.\nIPH. Give thyself up to me now, and turn not thyself to cares.\nAG. But I am altogether concerned with thee, and on no other subject.\nIPH. Relax thy brow, and open thy eyes in joy.\nAG. See, I rejoice as I rejoice, at seeing thee, child.[52]\nIPH. And then dost let fall a tear from thine eyes?\nAG. For long to us is the coming absence.\nIPH. I know not what you mean, I know not, dearest father mine.\nAG. Speaking sensibly, thou movest me the more to pity.\nIPH. I will speak foolishly, if I so may rejoice you.\nAG. Alas! I can not keep silence, but I commend thee.\nIPH. Remain, O father, in the house with thy children,\nAG. I fain would, but not having what I would, I am pained.\nIPH. Perish war and the ills of Menelaus![53]\nAG. What has undone me will first undo others.\nIPH. How long a time wast thou absent in the recesses of Aulis!\nAG. And now also there is something hinders me from sending on the army.\nIPH. Where say they that the Phrygians dwell, father?\nAG. Where would that Paris, Priam's son, had never dwelt.\nIPH. And dost thou go a long distance, O father, when thou leavest me?\nAG. Thou art come, my daughter, to the same state with thy father.[54]\nIPH. Alas! would that it were fitting me and thee to take me with thee as thy fellow-sailor.\nAG. But there is yet a sailing for thee, where thou wilt remember thy father.\nIPH. Shall I go, sailing with my mother, or alone?\nAG. Alone, apart from thy father and mother.\nIPH. What, art thou going to make me dwell in other houses, father?\nAG. Cease. It is not proper for girls to know these matters.\nIPH. Hasten back from Phrygia, do, my father, having settled matters well there.\nAG. It first behooves me to offer a certain sacrifice here.\nIPH. But it is with the priests that thou shouldst consider sacred matters.\nAG. [Yet] shalt thou know it, for thou wilt stand round the altar.\nIPH. What, shall we stand in chorus round the altar, my father?[55]\nAG. I deem thee happier than myself, for that thou know-est nothing. But go within the house, that the girls may behold thee,[56] having given me a sad kiss and thy right hand, being about to dwell a long time away from thy sire. O bosom and cheeks, O yellow tresses, how has the city of the Phrygians proved a burden to us, and Helen! I cease my words, for swift does the drop trickle from mine eyes when I touch thee. Go into the house. But I, I crave thy pardon, (to Clytæmnestra,) daughter of Leda, if I showed too much feeling, being about to bestow my daughter on Achilles. For the departure [of a girl] is a happy one, but nevertheless it pains the parents, when a father, who has toiled much, delivers up his children to another home.\nCLY. I am not so insensible—but think thou that I shall experience the same feelings, (so that I should not chide thee,) when I lead forth my girl with nuptial rejoicings, but custom wears away these thoughts in course of time. I know, however, the name of him to whom thou hast promised thy daughter, but I would fain know of what race, and whence [he is.]\nAG. Ægina was the daughter of her father Asopus.\nCLY. And who of mortals or of Gods wedded her?\nAG. Jove, and she gave birth to Æacus, prince of Œnone.\nCLY. But what son obtained the house of Æacus?\nAG. Peleus, and Peleus obtained the daughter of Nereus.\nCLY. By the gift of the God, or taking her in spite of the Gods?\nAG. Jove acted as a sponsor, and bestowed her, having the power.[57]\nCLY. And where does he wed her? In the wave of the sea?\nAG. Where Chiron dwells at the sacred foot of Pelion.\nCLY. Where they say that the race of Centaurs dwells?\nAG. Here the Gods celebrated the nuptial feast of Peleus.\nCLY. But did Thetis, or his father, train up Achilles?\nAG. Chiron, that he might not learn the manners of evil mortals.\nCLY. Hah! wise was the instructor, and wiser he who intrusted him.\nAG. Such a man will be the husband of thy child.\nCLY. Not to be found fault with. But what city in Greece does he inhabit?\nAG. Near the river Apidanus in the confines of Phthia.\nCLY. Thither will he lead thy virgin [daughter] and mine.\nAG. This shall be the care of him, her possessor.\nCLY. And may the pair be happy; but on what day will he wed her?\nAG. When the prospering orb of the moon comes round.\nCLY. But hast thou already sacrificed the first offerings for thy daughter to the Goddess?\nAG. I am about to do so. In this matter we are now engaged.\nCLY. And wilt thou then celebrate a wedding-feast afterward?\nAG. [Ay,] having sacrificed such offerings as it behooves me to sacrifice to the Gods.\nCLY. But where shall we set out a banquet for the women?\nAG. Here, by the fair-pooped ships of the Greeks.\nCLY. Well, and poorly,[58] forsooth! but may it nevertheless turn out well.\nAG. Do then thou knowest what, O lady, and obey me.\nCLY. In what? for I am accustomed to obey thee.\nAG. We indeed in this place, where the bridegroom is—\nCLY. Will do what without the mother, [of those things] which it behooves me to do?\nAG. —will bestow your daughter among the Greeks.\nCLY. But where must I be in the mean time?\nAG. Go to Argos, and take care of your virgins.\nCLY. Leaving my child? And who will bear the [nuptial] torch?\nAG. I will furnish the light that becomes the nuptials.\nCLY. The custom is not thus, but you think these matters trifles.\nAG. It is not proper that thou shouldst mingle in the crowd of the army.\nCLY. It is proper that I, the mother, should bestow at least my own daughter.\nAG. And it [is proper] that the damsels at home should not be alone.\nCLY. They are well guarded in their close chambers.\nAG. Obey me.\nCLY. [No,] by the Argive Goddess queen. But go you, and attend to matters abroad, but I [will mind] the affairs at home, as to the things which should be present to virgins at their wedding.[59]\nAG. Alas! In vain have I toiled,[60] and have been frustrated in my hope, wishing to send my wife out of my sight. But I am using stratagems, and finding contrivances against those I best love, overcome at all points. But nevertheless with the prophet Calchas I will go and ask the pleasure of the Goddess, not fortunate for me, the trouble of Greece.[61] But it behooves a wise man either to support a useful and good wife in his house or not to marry at all.[62]\nCHORUS. The assembly of the Grecian army will come to Simois, and to the silver eddies, both with ships and with arms, to Ilium, and to the Phœbeian plain of Troy, where I hear that Cassandra, adorned with a green-blossoming crown of laurel, lets loose her yellow locks, when the prophetic influence of the Gods breathes upon her. And the Trojans will stand upon the towers of Troy and around its walls, when brazen-shielded Mars, borne over the sea in fair-prowed ships, approaches the beds of Simois by rowing, seeking to bear away Helen, [the sister] of the twain sons of Jove in heaven, into the land of Greece, by the war-toiling shields and spears of the Greeks. But having surrounded Pergamus,[63] the city of the Phrygians, around its towers of stone, with bloody Mars, having torn off the heads [of the citizens] cut from their necks, having completely ravaged the city of Troy, he will make the daughters and wife of Priam shed many tears. But Helen, the daughter of Jove, will sit† in sad lamentation, having left her husband. Never upon me or upon my children's children may this expectation come, such as the wealthy Lydian and Phrygian wives possess while at their spinning, conversing thus with each other. Who,[64] dragging out my fair-haired tresses, will choose me as his spoil despite my tears, while my country is perishing? Through thee [forsooth,] the offspring of the long-necked swan, if indeed the report is true, that Leda † met with[65] a winged bird, when the body of Jove was transformed, and then in the tablets of the muses fables spread these reports among men, inopportunely, and in vain.\n[Enter ACHILLES.]\nACHILLES. Where about here is the general of the Greeks? Who of the servants will tell him that Achilles, the son of Peleus, is seeking him at the gates? For we do not remain by the Euripus in equal condition; for some of us being unyoked in nuptials, having left our solitary homes, sit here upon the shore, but others, having wives and children:[66] so violent a passion for this expedition has fallen upon Greece, not without the will of the Gods. It is therefore right that I should speak of what concerns me, and whoever else wishes will himself speak for himself. For leaving the Pharsalian land, and Peleus, I am waiting for these light gales of Euripus,[67] restraining the Myrmidons, who are continually pressing me, and saying, 'Achilles, why tarry we? what manner of time must the armament against Troy yet measure out? At any rate act, if you are going to do any thing, or lead the army home, not abiding the delays of the Atrides.'\nCLY. O son of the Goddess, daughter of Nereus, hearing from within thy words, I have come out before the house.\nACH. O hallowed modesty, who can this woman be whom I behold here, possessing a fair-seeming form?\nCLY. It is no wonder that you know me not, whom you have never seen before, but I commend you because you respect modesty.\nACH. But who art thou? And wherefore hast thou come to the assembly of the Greeks, a woman to men guarded with shields?\nCLY. I am the daughter of Leda, and Clytæmnestra is my name, and my husband is king Agamemnon.\nACH. Well hast thou in few words spoken what is seasonable. But it is unbecoming for me to converse with women. (Is going.)\nCLY. Remain, (why dost thou fly?) at least join thy right hand with mine, as a happy commencement of betrothal.\nACH. What sayest thou? I [give] thee my right hand? I should be ashamed of Agamemnon, if I touched what is not lawful for me.\nCLY. It is particularly lawful, since you are going to wed my daughter, O son of the sea Goddess, daughter of Nereus.\nACH. What marriage dost thou say? Surprise possesses me, lady, unless, being beside yourself, you speak this new thing.\nCLY. This is the nature of all people, to be ashamed when they behold new friends, and are put in mind of nuptials.\nACH. I never wooed thy daughter, lady, nor has any thing been said to me on the subject of marriage by the Atrides.\nCLY. What can it be? Do you in turn marvel at my words, for thine are a marvel to me.\nACH. Conjecture; these matters are a common subject for conjecture, for both of us perhaps are deceived in our words.[68]\nCLY. But surely I have suffered terrible things! I am acting as match-maker in regard to a marriage that has no existence. I am ashamed of this.\nACH. Perhaps some one has trifled with both me and thee. But pay no attention to it, and bear it with indifference.\nCLY. Farewell, for I can no longer behold thee with uplifted eyes, having appeared as a liar, and suffered unworthy things.\nACH. And this same [farewell] is thine from me. But I will go seek thy husband within this house.\n[The OLD MAN appears at the door of the house.]\nOLD M. O stranger, grandson of Æacus, remain. Ho! thee, I say, the son of the Goddess, and thee, the daughter of Leda.\nACM. Who is it that calls, partially opening the doors? With what terror he calls!\nOLD M. A slave. I will not be nice about the title, for fortune allows it not.\nACH. Of whom? for thou art not mine. My property and Agamemnon's are different.\nOLD M. Of this lady who is before the house, the gift of her father Tyndarus.\nACH. We are still. Say if thou wantest any thing, for which thou hast stopped me.\nOLD M. Are ye sure that ye alone stand before these gates?\nCLY. Ay, so that you may speak to us only. But come out from the royal dwelling.\nOLD M. (Coming forward) O fortune, and foresight mine, preserve whom I wish.\nACH. These words will do for[69] a future occasion, for they have some weight.\nCLY. By thy right hand [I beseech thee,] delay not, if thou hast aught to say to me.\nOLD M. Thou knowest then, being what manner of man, I have been by nature well disposed to thee and thy children.\nCLY. I know thee as being a faithful servant to my house.\nOLD M. And that king Agamemnon received me among thy dowry.\nCLY. Thou camest into Argos with us, and thou wast always mine.\nOLD M. So it is, and I am well disposed to thee, but less so to thy husband.\nCLY. Unfold now at least to me what words you are saying.\nOLD M. The father who begat her is about to slay thy daughter with his own hand.\nCLY. How? I deprecate thy words, old man, for thou thinkest not well.\nOLD M. Cutting the fair neck of the hapless girl with the sword.\nCLY. O wretched me! Is my husband mad?\nOLD M. He is in his right mind, save with respect to thee and thy daughter, but in this he is not wise.\nCLY. Upon what grounds? What maddening fiend impels him?\nOLD M. The oracles, as at least Calchas says, in order that the army may be able to proceed.\nCLY. Whither? Wretched me, and wretched she whom her father is about to slay?\nOLD M. To the house of Dardanus, that Menelaus may recover Helen.\nCLY. To the destruction, then, of Iphigenia, was the return of Helen foredoomed?\nOLD M. Thou hast the whole story. Her father is going to offer thy daughter to Diana.\nCLY. What! what pretext had the marriage, that brought me from home?\nOLD M. That thou rejoicing mightest bring thy child, as if about to wed her to Achilles.\nCLY. O daughter, both thou and thy mother are come to meet with destruction.\nOLD M. Ye twain are suffering sad things, and dreadful things hath Agamemnon dared.\nCLY. I wretched am undone, and my eyes no longer restrain the tear.\nOLD M. For bitter 'tis to mourn, deprived of one's children.\nCLY. But whence, old man, sayest thou that thou hast learned and knowest these things?\nOLD M. I went to bear a letter to thee, in reference to what was before written.\nCLY. Not allowing, or bidding me to bring my child, that she might die?\nOLD M. [It was] that you should not bring her, for your husband then thought well.\nCLY. And how was it then, that, bearing the letter, thou gavest it not to me?\nOLD M. Menelaus, who is the cause of these evils, took it from me.\nCLY. O child of Nereus' daughter, O son of Peleus, dost hear these things?\nACH. I hear that thou art wretched, and I do not bear my part indifferently.\nCLY. They will slay my child, having deceived her with thy nuptials.\nACH. I also blame thy husband, nor do I bear it lightly.\nCLY. I will not be ashamed to fall down at thy knee, mortal, to one born of a Goddess. For wherefore should I make a show of pride? Or what should I study more than my children? But, O son of the Goddess, aid me in my unhappiness, and her who is called thy wife, vainly indeed, but nevertheless, having decked her out, I led her as if to be married, but now I lead her to sacrifice, and reproach will come upon thee, who gavest no aid. For though thou wast not yoked in nuptials, at least thou wast called the beloved husband of the hapless virgin. By thy beard, by thy right hand, by thy mother [I beseech] thee, for thy name hath undone me, to whom thou shouldst needs give assistance. I have no other altar to fly to, but thy knee, nor is any friend near me,[70] but thou hearest the cruel and all-daring conduct of Agamemnon. But I a woman, as thou seest, have come to a naval host, uncontrolled, and bold for mischief, but useful, when they are willing. But if thou wilt venture to stretch thine hand in my behalf, we are saved, but if not, we are not saved.\nCHOR. A terrible thing it is to be a mother, and it bears a great endearment, and one common to all, so as to toil on behalf of their children.\nACH. My mind is high-lifted in its thoughts,[71] and knows both how to grieve [moderately] in troubles, and to rejoice moderately in high prosperity. For the discreet among mortals are such as pass through life correctly with wisdom. Now there are certain cases where it is pleasant not to be too wise, and also where it is useful to possess wisdom. But I, being nurtured [in the dwelling] of a most pious man, Chiron, have learned to possess a candid disposition. And I will obey the Atrides, if indeed they order well, but when not well, I obey not. But here in Troy showing a free nature I will glorify Mars with the spear, as far as I can. But, O thou who hast suffered wretchedly at the hands of those dearest, in whatever can be done by a youth, I, showing so much pity, will set thee right, and thy daughter, having been called my bride, shall never be sacrificed by her father, for I will not furnish thy husband with my person to weave stratagems upon. For my name, even if he lift not up the sword, will slay thy daughter, but thy husband is the cause. But my body is no longer pure, if on my account, and because of my marriage, there perish a virgin who has gone through sad and unbearable troubles, and has been marvelously and undeservedly ill treated. I were the worst man among the Greeks, I were of naught (but Menelaus would be among men), not as born from Peleus, but from some fiend, if my name acts the murderer for thy husband.[72] By Nereus, nurtured in the damp waves, the father of Thetis, who begat me, king Agamemnon shall not lay hands on thy daughter, not so much as with a little finger, so as to touch her garments. I' faith, Sipylus, a fortress of barbarians, whence the [royal] generals trace their descent, shall be deemed a city, but the name of Phthia shall nowhere be named. And the seer Calchas will to his cost consecrate the sacrificial cakes and lustral waters. (But what man is a prophet?) who tells[73] a few things true, (but many falsely,) when he has made a hit, but when he fails, is undone. These words are not spoken for the sake of my wedding, (ten thousand girls are hunting after alliance with me,) but [because] king Agamemnon has been guilty of insult toward me. But it behooved him to ask [the use of] my name from me, as an enticement for his daughter, and Clytæmnestra would have been most readily persuaded to give her daughter to me as a husband. And I would have given her up to the Greeks, if on this account their passage to Troy had been impeded: I would not have refused to augment the common interest of those with whom I set out on the expedition. But now I am held as of no account by the generals, and it is a matter of indifference whether I benefit them or not. Soon shall my sword witness, which, before death came against the Phrygians,[74] I stained with spots of blood, whether any one shall take thy daughter from me. But keep quiet, I have appeared to thee as a most mighty God, though not [a God,] but nevertheless I will be such.\nCHOR. O son of Peleus, thou hast spoken both worthily of thyself, and of the marine deity, hallowed Goddess.\nCLY. Alas! how can I praise thee neither too much in words, nor, being deficient in this respect, [not] lose thy favor? For in a certain wise the praised dislike their praisers, if they praise too much. But I am ashamed at alleging pitiable words, being troubled in myself, while thou art not diseased with my ills. But in fact the good man has some reason, even though he be unconnected with them, for assisting the unfortunate. But pity us, for we have suffered pitiably; I, who, in the first place, thinking to have thee for a kinsman, cherished a vain hope.—Moreover, my child, by dying, might perchance become an omen to thy future bridals,[75] which thou must needs avoid. But well didst thou speak both first and last, for, if thou art willing, my child will be saved. Dost wish that she embrace thy knee as a suppliant? Such conduct is not virgin-like, but if thou wilt, she shall come, with her noble face suffused with modesty. Or shall I obtain these things from thee, without her presence?\nACH. Let her remain within doors, for with dignity she preserves her dignity.\nCLY. Yet one must needs have modesty [only] as far as circumstances allow.\nACH. Do thou neither bring forth thy daughter into my sight, lady, not let us fall into reproach for inconsiderate conduct, for our assembled army, being idle from home occupations, loves evil and slanderous talk. But at all events you will accomplish the same, whether you come to me as a suppliant, or do not supplicate, for a mighty contest awaits me, to release you from these evils. Wherefore, having heard one thing, be persuaded that I will not speak falsely. But if I speak falsely, and vainly amuse you, may I perish; but may I not perish, if I preserve the virgin.\nCLY. Mayest thou be blest, ever assisting the unhappy.\nACH. Hear me then, that the matter may be well.\nCLY. What is this thou sayest? for one must listen to thee.\nACH. Let us again persuade her father to be wiser.\nCLY. He is a coward, and fears the army too much.\nACH. But words can conquer words.\nCLY. Chilly is the hope, but tell me what I must do.\nACH. Beseech him first not to slay his child, but if he oppose this, you must come to me. For if he will be persuaded what you wish, there is no occasion for my efforts, for this very [consent] contains her safety. And I also shall appear in a better light with my friend, and the army will not blame me, if I transact matters by discretion rather than force. And if this turn out well, these things, even without my help, may turn out satisfactorily to thy friends and thyself.[76]\nCLY. How wisely hast thou spoken! But what thou sayest must be done. But if I do not obtain what I seek, where shall I again see thee? Where must I wretched woman, coming, find thee an assistant in my troubles?\nACH. We guards will watch thee when there is occasion, lest any one behold thee going in agitation through the host of the Greeks. But do not shame thy ancestral home, for Tyndarus is not worthy of an evil reputation, seeing he is great among the Greeks.\nCLY. These things shall be. Command; it is meet that I obey thee. But if there are Gods, you, being a just man, will receive a good reward; but if not, why should one toil?\nCHOR. What was that nuptial song that raised[77] its strains on the Libyan reed, and with the dance-loving lyre, and the reedy syrinx, when o'er Pelion at the feast of the Gods the fair-haired muses, striking their feet with golden sandals against the ground, came to the wedding of Peleus, celebrating with melodious sounds Thetis, and the son of Æacus, on the mountains of the Centaurs, through the Palian wood.\nBut the Dardan,[78] [Phrygian Ganymede,] dear delight of Jove's bed, poured out the nectar in the golden depths of the goblets, and along the white sands the fifty daughters of Nereus, entwining in circles, adorned the nuptials of Nereus with the dance. But with darts of fir, and crowns of grass, the horse-mounted troop of the Centaurs came to the banquet of the Gods and the cup of Bacchus. And the Thessalian girls shouted loud,[79] 'O daughter of Nereus,' and the prophet Phœbus, and Chiron, skilled in letters, declared, 'Thou shalt bring forth a mighty light, who shall come to the [Trojan] land with Myrmidons armed with spear and shield, to burn the renowned city of Priam, around his body armed with a covering of golden arms wrought by Vulcan, having them as a gift from his Goddess Thetis, who begat him blessed.' Then the deities celebrated the nuptials of the noble daughter of Nereus first,[80] and of Peleus. But thee, [O Iphigenia,] they will crown on the head with flowery garlands, like as a pure spotted heifer from a rocky cave, making bloody the mortal throat [of one] not trained up with the pipe, nor amidst the songs of herdsmen, but as a bride[81] prepared by thy mother for some one of the Argives. Where has the face of shame, or virtue any power to prevail? Since impiety indeed has influence, but virtue is left behind and disregarded by mortals, and lawlessness governs law, and it is a common struggle for mortals, lest any envy of the Gods befall.\nCLY. I have come out of the house to seek for my husband, who has been absent, and has quitted the house a long time. But my hapless daughter is in tears, casting forth many a change of complaint, having heard the death her father devises for her. But I was mindful of Agamemnon who is now coming hither,[82] who will quickly be detected doing evil deeds against his own children.\nAG. Daughter of Leda, opportunely have I found you without the house, that I may tell thee, apart from the virgin, words which it is not meet for those to hear who are about to marry.\nCLY. And what is it, on which your convenience lays hold?\nAG. Send forth thy daughter from the house with her father, since the lustral waters are ready prepared, and the salt-cakes to scatter with the hands upon the purifying flame, and heifers, which needs must be slain in honor of the Goddess Diana before the marriage solemnities, a shedding of black gore.\nCLY. In words, indeed, thou speakest well, but for thy deeds, I know not how I may say thou speakest well. But come without, O daughter, for thou knowest all that thy father meditates, and beneath thy robes bring the child Orestes, thy brother. See, she is here present to obey thee. But the rest I will speak on her behalf and mine.\nAG. Child, why weepest thou, and no longer beholdest me cheerfully, but fixing thy face upon the ground, keepest thy vest before it?\nCLY. Alas! What commencement of my sorrows shall I take? For I may use them all as first, [both last, and middle throughout.[83]]\nAG. But what is it? How all of you are come to one point with me, bearing disturbed and alarmed countenances.\nCLY. Wilt thou answer candidly, husband, if I ask thee?\nAG. There needs no admonition: I would fain be questioned.\nCLY. Art thou going to slay thy child and mine?\nAG. Ah! wretched things dost thou say, and thinkest what thou shouldst not.\nCLY. Keep quiet, and first in turn answer me that.\nAG. But if thou askest likely things, thou wilt hear likely.\nCLY. I ask no other things, nor do thou answer me others.\nAG. O revered destiny, and fate, and fortune mine!\nCLY. Ay, and mine too, and this child's, one of three unfortunates!\nAG. But in what art thou wronged?\nCLY. Dost thou ask me this? This thy wit hath no wit.[84]\nAG. I am undone. My secret plans are betrayed.\nCLY. I know and have learned all that you are about to do to me, and the very fact of thy silence, and of thy groaning much, is a proof that you confess it. Do not take the trouble to say any thing.\nAG. Behold, I am silent: for what need is there that, falsely speaking, I add shamelessness to misfortune?\nCLY. Listen, then, for I will unfold my story, and will no longer make use of riddles away from the purpose. In the first place, that I may first reproach thee with this—thou didst wed me unwilling, and obtain me by force, having slain Tantalus, my former husband, and having dashed[85] my infant living to the ground, having torn him by force from my breast. And the twin sons of Jove, my brothers, glorying in their steeds, made war [against thee] but my old father Tyndarus saved you, when you had become a suppliant, and thou again didst possess me as a wife. When I, being reconciled to thee in respect to thy person and home, thou wilt bear witness how blameless a wife I was, both modest in respect to affection, and enriching thy house, so that thou both going within and without thy doors wast blessed. And 'tis a rare prize for a man to obtain such a wife, but there is no lack of getting a bad spouse. And I bear thee this son, besides three virgins, of one of whom thou art cruelly going to deprive me. And if any one ask thee on what account thou wilt slay her, say, what will you answer? or must I needs make your plea, 'that Menelaus may obtain Helen?' A pretty custom, forsooth, that children must pay the price of a bad woman. We gain the most hateful things at the hand of those dearest. Come, if thou wilt set out, leaving me at home, and then wilt be a long time absent, what sort of feelings dost think I shall experience, when I behold every seat empty of this child's presence, and every virgin chamber empty, but myself sit in tears alone, ever mourning her [in such strains as these:] 'My child, thy father, who begat thee, hath destroyed thee, himself, no other, the slayer, by no other hand, leaving such a reward for [my care of] the house.'[86] Since there wants but a little reason for me and my remaining daughters to give thee such a reception as you deserve to receive. Do not, by the Gods, either compel me to act evilly toward thee, nor do thou thyself be so. Ah well! thou wilt sacrifice thy daughter—what prayers wilt thou then utter? What good thing wilt thou crave for thyself, slaying thy child? An evil return, seeing, forsooth, thou hast disgracefully set out from home. But is it right that I should pray for thee any good thing? Verily we must believe the Gods are senseless, if we feel well disposed to murderers. But wilt thou, returning to Argos, embrace thy children? But 'tis not lawful for thee. Will any of your children look upon you, if thou offerest one of them for slaughter? Thus far have I proceeded in my argument. What! does it only behoove thee to carry about thy sceptre and marshal the army?—whose duty it were to speak a just speech among the Greeks: 'Do ye desire, O Greeks, to sail against the land of the Phrygians? Cast lots, whose daughter needs must die'—for this would be on equal terms, but not that you should give thy daughter to the Greeks as a chosen victim. Or Menelaus, whose affair it was, ought to slay Hermione for her mother's sake. But now I, having cherished thy married life, shall be bereaved of my child, but she who has sinned, bearing her daughter under her care to Sparta, will be blest. As to these things, answer me if I say aught not rightly, but if I have spoken well, do not then slay thy child and mine, and thou wilt be wise.\nCHOR. Be persuaded, Agamemnon, for 'tis right to join in saving one's children. No one of mortals will gainsay this.\nIPH. If, O father, I possessed the eloquence of Orpheus, that I might charm by persuasion, so that rocks should follow me, and that I might soften whom I would by my words, to this would I have resorted. But now I will offer tears as all my skill, for these I can. And, as a suppliant bough, I press against thy knees my body, which this [my mother] bore thee, [beseeching] that thou slay me not before my time, for sweet it is to behold the light, nor do thou compel me to visit the places beneath the earth. And I first[87] hailed thee sire, and thou [didst first call] me daughter, and first drawing nigh to thy knees, I gave and in turn received sweet tokens of affection. And such, were thy words: 'My daughter, shall I some time behold thee prospering in a husband's home, living and flourishing worthily of me?' And mine in turn ran thus, as I hung about thy beard, which now with my hand I embrace: 'But how shall I [treat] thee? Shall I receive thee when an old man, O father, with the hearty reception of my house, repaying thee the careful nurture of my youth?' Of such words have remembrance, but thou hast forgotten them, and fain wouldst slay me. Do not, [I beseech you] by Pelops and by thy father Atreus, and this my mother, who having before brought me forth with throes, now suffers this second throe. What have I to do with the marriage of Paris and Helen? Whence came he, father, for my destruction? Look upon me; give me one look, one kiss, that this memorial of thee at least I, dying, may possess, if thou wilt not be persuaded by my words. Brother, thou art but a little helpmate to those dear, yet weep with me, beseech thy sire that thy sister die not. Even in babes there is wont to be some sense of evil. Behold, O father, he silently implores thee. But respect my prayer, and have pity on my years. Yea, by thy beard we, two dear ones, implore thee; the one is yet a nursling, but the other grown up. In one brief saying I will overcome all arguments. This light of heaven is sweetest of things for men to behold, but that below is naught; and mad is he who seeks to die. To live dishonorably is better than to die gloriously.\nCHOR. O wretched Helen, through thee and thy nuptials there is come a contest for the Atrides and their children.\nAG. I can understand what merits pity, and what not; and I love my children, for [otherwise] I were mad. And dreadful 'tis for me[88] to dare these things, O woman, and dreadful not to do so—for so I must needs act. Thou seest how great is this naval host, and how many are the chieftains of brazen arms among the Greeks, to whom there is not a power of arriving at the towers of Troy, unless I sacrifice you, as the seer Calchas says, nor can we take the renowned plain of Troy. But a certain passion has maddened the army of the Greeks, to sail as quickly as possible upon the land of the barbarians, and to put a stop to the rapes of Grecian wives. And they will slay my daughters at Argos, and you, and me, if I break through the commands of the Goddess. It is not Menelaus who has enslaved me, O daughter, nor have I followed his device, but Greece, for whom I, will or nill, must needs offer thee. And I am inferior on this head. For it behooves her, [Helen,] as far as thou, O daughter, art concerned, to be free, nor for us, being Greeks, to be plundered perforce of our wives by barbarians.\nCLY. O child! O ye stranger women! O wretched me for thy death! Thy father flees from thee, giving thee up to Hades.\nIPH. Alas for me! mother, mother. The same song suits both of us on account of our fortunes, and no more to me is the light, nor this bright beam of the sun. Alas! alas! thou snow-smitten wood of Troy, and mountains of Ida, where once on a time Priam exposed a tender infant, having separated him from his mother, that he might meet with deadly fate, Paris, who was styled Idæan, Idæan [Paris] in the city of the Phrygians. Would that the herdsman Paris, who was nurtured in care of steers, had ne'er dwelt near the white stream, where are the fountains of the Nymphs, and the meadow flourishing with blooming flowers, and roseate flowers and hyacinths for Goddesses to cull. Where once on a time came Pallas, and artful Venus, and Juno, and Hermes, the messenger of Jove; Venus indeed, vaunting herself in charms, and Pallas in the spear, and Juno in the royal nuptials of king Jove, [these came] to a hateful judgment and strife concerning beauty; but my death, my death, O virgins, bearing glory indeed to the Greeks, Diana hath received as first-fruits [of the expedition] against Troy.[89] But he that begot me wretched, O mother, O mother, has departed, leaving me deserted. O hapless me! having †beheld† bitter, bitter, ill-omened Helen, I am slain, I perish, by the impious slaughter of an impious sire. Would[90] for me that Aulis had never received the poops of the brazen-beaked ships into these ports, the fleet destined for Troy, nor that Jove had breathed an adverse wind over Euripus, softening one breeze so that some mortals might rejoice in their [expanded] sails, but to others a pain, to others difficulty, to some to set sail, to others to furl their sails, but to others to tarry. In truth the race of mortals is full of troubles, is full of troubles, and it necessarily befalls men to find some misfortune. Alas! alas! thou daughter of Tyndarus, who hast brought many sufferings, and many griefs upon the Greeks.\nCHOR. I indeed pity you having met with an evil calamity, such as thou never shouldst have met with.\nIPH. O mother, to whom I owe my birth, I behold a crowd of men near.\nCLY. Ay, the son of the Goddess, my child, for whom thou camest hither.\nIPH. Open the house, ye servants, that I may hide myself.\nCLY. But why dost thou fly hence, my child?\nIPH. I am ashamed to behold this Achilles.\nCLY. On what account?\nIPH. The unfortunate turn-out of my nuptials shames me.\nCLY. Thou art not in a state to give way to delicacy in the present circumstances. But do thou remain, there is no use for punctilio, if we can [but save your life.]\nACH. O hapless lady, daughter of Leda.\nCLY. Thou sayest not falsely.\nACH. Terrible things are cried out among the Greeks.\nCLY. What cry? tell me.\nACH. Concerning thy child.\nCLY. Thou speakest a word of ill omen.\nACH. That it is necessary to slay her.\nCLY. Does no one speak the contrary to this?\nACH. Ay, I myself have got into trouble.\nCLY. Into what [trouble,] O friend?\nACH. Of having my body stoned with stones.\nCLY. What, in trying to save my daughter!\nACH. This very thing.\nCLY. And who would have dared to touch thy person?\nACH. All the Greeks.\nCLY. And was not the host of the Myrmidons at hand for thee?\nACH. That was the first that showed enmity.\nCLY. Then are we utterly undone, my daughter.\nACH. For they railed at me as overcome by a betrothed—\nCLY. And what didst thou reply?\nACH. That they should not slay my intended bride.\nCLY. For so 'twas right.\nACH. [She] whom her father had promised me.\nCLY. Ay, and had sent for from Argos.\nACH. But I was worsted by the outcry.\nCLY. For the multitude is a terrible evil.\nACH. But nevertheless I will aid thee.\nCLY. And wilt thou, being one, fight with many?\nACH. Dost see these men bearing [my] arms?\nCLY. Mayest thou gain by thy good intentions.\nACH. But I will gain.\nCLY. Then my child will not be slain?\nACH. Not, at least, with my consent.\nCLY. And will any one come to lay hands on the girl?\nACH. Ay, a host of them, but Ulysses will conduct her.\nCLY. Will it be the descendant of Sisyphus?\nACH. The very man.\nCLY. Doing it of his own accord, or appointed by the army?\nACH. Chosen willingly.\nCLY. A wicked choice forsooth, to commit slaughter!\nACH. But I will restrain him.\nCLY. But will he lead her unwillingly, having seized her?\nACH. Ay, by her auburn locks.\nCLY. But what must I then do?\nACH. Keep hold of your daughter.\nCLY. As far as this goes she shall not be slain.\nACH. But it will come to this at all events.[91]\nIPH. Mother, do thou hear my words, for I perceive that thou art vainly wrathful with thy husband, but it is not easy for us to struggle with things [almost] impossible. It is meet therefore to praise our friend for his willingness, but it behooves thee also to see that you be not an object of reproach to the army, and we profit nothing more, and he meet with calamity. But hear me, mother, thinking upon what has entered my mind. I have determined to die, and this I would fain do gloriously, I mean, by dismissing all ignoble thoughts. Come hither, mother, consider with me how well I speak. Greece, the greatest of cities, is now all looking upon me, and there rests in me both the passage of the ships and the destruction of Troy, and, for the women hereafter, if the barbarians do them aught of harm, to allow them no longer to carry them off from prosperous Greece, having avenged the destruction of Helen, whom Paris bore away.[92] All these things I dying shall redeem, and my renown, for that I have freed Greece, will be blessed. Moreover, it is not right that I should be too fond of life; for thou hast brought me forth for the common good of Greece, not for thyself only. But shall ten thousand men armed with bucklers, and ten thousand, oars in hand, their country being injured, dare to do some deed against the foes, and perish on behalf of Greece, while my life, being but one, shall hinder all these things? What manner of justice is this? Have we a word to answer? And let me come to this point: it is not meet that this man should come to strife with all the Greeks for the sake of a woman, nor lose his life. And one man, forsooth, is better than ten thousand women, that he should behold the light. But if Diana hath wished to receive my body, shall I, being mortal, become an opponent to the Goddess! But it can not be. I give my body for Greece. Sacrifice it, and sack Troy. For this for a long time will be my memorial, and this my children, my wedding, and my glory. But it is meet that Greeks should rule over barbarians, O mother, but not barbarians over Greeks, for the one is slavish, but the others are free.\nCHOR. Thy part, indeed, O virgin, is glorious; but the work of fortune and of the Gods sickens.\nACH. Daughter of Agamemnon, some one of the Gods destined me to happiness, if I obtained thee as a wife, and I envy Greece on thy account, and thee on account of Greece. For well hast thou spoken this, and worthily of the country, for, ceasing to strive with the deity, who is more powerful than thou art, thou hast considered what is good and useful. But still more does a desire of thy union enter my mind, when I look to thy nature, for thou art noble. But consider, for I wish to benefit you, and to receive you to my home, and, Thetis be my witness, I am grieved if I shall not save you, coming to conflict with the Greeks. Consider: death is a terrible ill.\nIPH. I speak these words, no others, with due foresight. Enough is the daughter of Tyndarus to have caused contests and slaughter of men through her person: but do not thou, O stranger, die in my behalf, nor slay any one. But let me preserve Greece, if I am able.\nACH. O best of spirits, I have naught further to answer thee, since it seems thus to thee, for thou hast noble thoughts; for wherefore should not one tell the truth? But nevertheless thou mayest perchance repent these things. In order, therefore, that thou mayest all that lies in my power, I will go and place these my arms near the altar, as I will not allow you to die, but hinder it. And thou too wilt perhaps be of my opinion, when thou seest the sword nigh to thy neck. I will not allow thee to die through thy wild determination, but going with these mine arms to the temple of the Goddess, I will await thy presence there.\nIPH. Mother, why dost thou silently bedew thine eyes with tears?\nCLY. I wretched have a reason, so as to be pained at heart.\nIPH. Cease; do not daunt me, but obey me in this.\nCLY. Speak, for thou shalt not be wronged at my hands, my child.\nIPH. Neither then do thou cut off the locks of thine hair, [nor put on black garments around thy body.]\nCLY. Wherefore sayest thou this, my child? Having lost thee—\nIPH. Not you indeed—I am saved, and thou wilt be glorious as far as I am concerned.\nCLY. How sayest thou? Must I not bemoan thy life?\nIPH. Not in the least, since no tomb will be upraised for me.\nCLY. Why, what then is death? Is not a tomb customary?[93]\nIPH. The altar of the Goddess, daughter of Jove, will be my memorial.\nCLY. But, O child, I will obey thee, for thou speakest well.\nIPH. Ay, as prospering like the benefactress of Greece.\nCLY. What then shall I tell thy sisters?\nIPH. Neither do thou clothe them in black garments.\nCLY. But shall I speak any kind message from thee to the virgins?\nIPH. Ay, [bid them] fare well, and do thou, for my sake, train up this [boy] Orestes to be a man.\nCLY. Embrace him, beholding him for the last time.\nIPH. O dearest one, thou hast assisted thy friends to the utmost in thy power.\nCLY. Can I, by doing any thing in Argos, do thee a pleasure?\nIPH. Hate not my father, yes, thy husband.\nCLY. He needs shall go through terrible trials on thy account.\nIPH. Unwillingly he hath undone me on behalf of the land of Greece.\nCLY. But ungenerously, by craft, and not in a manner worthy of Atreus.\nIPH. Who will come and lead me, before I am torn away by the hair?[94]\nCLY. I will go with thee.\nIPH. Not you indeed, thou sayest not well.\nCLY. Ay [but I will,] clinging to thy garments.\nIPH. Be persuaded by me, mother. Remain, for this is more fitting both for me and thee. But let some one of these my father's followers conduct me to the meadow of Diana, where I may be sacrificed.\nCLY. O child, thou art going.\nIPH. Ay, and I shall ne'er return.\nCLY. Leaving thy mother—\nIPH. As thou seest, though, not worthily.\nCLY. Hold! Do not leave me.\nIPH. I do not suffer thee to shed tears. But, ye maidens, raise aloft the pæan for my sad hap, [celebrate] Diana, the daughter of Jove,[95] and let the joyful strain go forth to the Greeks. And let some one make ready the baskets, and let flame burn with the purifying cakes, and let my father serve the altar with his right hand, seeing I am going to bestow upon the Greeks safety that produces victory.[96]\nConduct me, the conqueror of the cities of Troy and of the Phrygians. Surround[97] me with crowns, bring them hither. Here is my hair to crown. And [bear hither] the lustral fountains.[98] Encircle [with dances] around the temple and the altar, Diana, queen Diana, the blessed, since by my blood and offering I will wash out her oracles, if it needs must be so. O revered, revered mother, thus † indeed † will we [now] afford thee our tears, for it is not fitting during the sacred rites. O damsels, join in singing Diana, who dwells opposite Chalcis, where the warlike ships have been eager [to set out,] being detained in the narrow harbors of Aulis here through my name.[99] Alas! O my mother-land of Pelasgia, and my Mycenian handmaids.\nCHOR. Dost thou call upon the city of Perseus, the work of the Cyclopean hands?\nIPH. Thou hast nurtured me for a glory to Greece, and I will not refuse to die.\nCHOR. For renown will not fail thee.\nIPH. Alas! alas! lamp-bearing day, and thou too, beam of Jove, another, another life and state shall we dwell in. Farewell for me, beloved light!\nCHOR. Alas! alas! Behold[100] the destroyer of the cities of Troy and of the Phrygians, wending her way, decked as to her head with garlands and with lustral streams, to the altar of the sanguinary Goddess, about to stream with drops of gore, being stricken on her fair neck. Fair dewy streams, and lustral waters from ancestral sources[101] await thee, and the host of the Greeks eager to reach Troy. But let us celebrate Diana, the daughter of Jove, queen of the Gods, as upon a prosperous occasion. O hallowed one, that rejoicest in human sacrifices, send the army of the Greeks into the land of the Phrygians, and the territory of deceitful Troy, and grant that by Grecian spears Agamemnon may place a most glorious crown upon his head, a glory ever to be remembered.\n[Enter a MESSENGER.[102]]\nMESS. O daughter of Tyndarus, Clytæmnestra, come without the house, that thou mayest hear my words.\nCLY. Hearing thy voice, I wretched came hither, terrified and astounded with fear, lest thou shouldst be come, bearing some new calamity to me in addition to the present one.\nMESS. Concerning thy daughter, then, I wish to tell thee marvelous and fearful things.\nCLY. Then delay not, but speak as quickly as possible.\nMESS. But, my dear mistress, thou shalt learn every thing clearly, and I will speak from the very commencement, unless my memory, in something failing, deceive my tongue. For when we came to the inclosure and flowery meads of Diana, the daughter of Jove, where there was an assembly of the army of the Greeks, leading thy daughter, the host of the Greeks was straightway convened. But when king Agamemnon beheld the girl wending her way to the grove for slaughter, he groaned aloud, and turning back his head, he shed tears, placing his garments[103] before his eyes. But she, standing near him that begot her, spake thus: 'O father, I am here for thee, and I willing give my body on behalf of my country, and of the whole land of Greece, that, leading it to the altar of the Goddess, they may sacrifice it, since this is ordained. And, as far as I am concerned, may ye be fortunate, and obtain the gift of victory, and reach your native land. Furthermore, let no one of the Greeks lay hands on me, for with a stout heart I will present my neck in silence.' Thus much she spoke, and every one marveled on hearing the courage and valor of the virgin. But Talthybius, whose office this was, standing in the midst, proclaimed good-omened silence to the people. And the seer Calchas placed in a golden canister a sharp knife,[104] which he had drawn out,† within its case,† and crowned the head of the girl. But the son of Peleus ran around the altar of the Goddess, taking the canister and lustral waters at the same time. And he said: 'O Diana, beast-slaying daughter of Jove, that revolvest thy brilliant light by night, receive this offering which we bestow on thee, [we] the army of the Greeks, and king Agamemnon, the pure blood from a fair virgin's neck; and grant that the sail may be without injury to our ships, and that we may take the towers of Troy by the spear.' But the Atrides and all the army stood looking on the ground, and the priest, taking the knife, prayed, and viewed her neck, that he might find a place to strike. And no little pity entered my mind, and I stood with eyes cast down, but suddenly there was a marvel to behold. For every one could clearly perceive the sound of the blow, but beheld not the virgin, where on earth she had vanished. But the priest exclaimed, and the whole army shouted, beholding an unexpected prodigy from some one of the Gods, of which, though seen, they had scarcely belief. For a stag lay panting on the ground, of mighty size to see and beautiful in appearance, with whose blood the altar of the Goddess was abundantly wetted. And upon this Calchas (think with what joy!) thus spake: 'O leaders of this common host of the Greeks, behold this victim which the Goddess hath brought to her altar, a mountain-roaming stag. This she prefers greatly to the virgin, lest her altar should be denied with generous blood. And she hath willingly received this, and grants us a prosperous sail, and attack upon Troy. Upon this do every sailor take good courage, and go to his ships, since on this day it behooves us, quitting the hollow recesses of Aulis, to pass over the Ægean wave.' But when the whole victim was reduced to ashes, he prayed what was meet, that the army might obtain a passage. And Agamemnon sends me to tell thee this, and to say what a fortune he hath met with from the Gods, and hath obtained unwaning glory through Greece. But I speak, having been present, and witnessing the matter. Thy child has evidently flown to the Gods; away then with grief, and cease wrath against your husband. But the will of the Gods is unforeseen by mortals, and them they love, they save. For this day hath beheld thy daughter dying and living [in turn.]\nCHOR. How delighted am I at hearing this from the messenger; but he says that thy daughter living abides among the Gods.\nCLY. O daughter, of whom of the Gods art thou the theft? How shall I address thee? What shall I say that these words do not offer me a vain comfort, that I may cease from my mournful grief on thy account?\nCHOR. And truly king Agamemnon draws hither, having this same story to tell thee.\n[Enter AGAMEMNON.]\nAG. Lady, as far as thy daughter is concerned, we may be happy, for she really possesses a companionship with the Gods. But it behooves thee, taking this young child [Orestes,] to go home, for the army is looking toward setting sail. And fare thee well, long hence will be my addresses to thee from Troy, and may it be well with thee.\nCHOR. Atrides, rejoicing go thou to the land of the Phrygians, and rejoicing return, having obtained for me most glorious spoils from Troy.",

    "content":"CHARACTERS OF THE PLAY\nIPHIGENIA, eldest daughter of Agamemnon, King of Argos; supposed to have been sacrificed by him to Artemis at Aulis.\nORESTES, her brother; pursued by Furies for killing his mother,\nClytemnestra, who had murdered Agamemnon.\nPYLADES, Prince of Phocis, friend to Orestes.\nTHOAS, King of Tauris, a savage country beyond the Symplegades.\nA HERDSMAN.\nA MESSENGER.\nCHORUS of Captive Greek Women, handmaids to Iphigenia.\nThe Goddess PALLAS ATHENA.\nThe play was first performed between the years 414 and 412 B.C.\nTHE IPHIGENIA IN TAURIS\n[The Scene shows a great and barbaric Temple on a desolate sea-coast. An altar is visible stained with blood. There are spoils of slain men hanging from the roof. IPHIGENIA, in the dress of a Priestess, comes out from the Temple.]\nIPHIGENIA.\nChild of the man of torment and of pride\nTantalid Pelops bore a royal bride\nOn flying steeds from Pisa. Thence did spring\nAtreus: from Atreus, linked king with king,\nMenelaus, Agamemnon. His am I\nAnd Clytemnestra's child: whom cruelly\nAt Aulis, where the strait of shifting blue\nFrets with quick winds, for Helen's sake he slew,\nOr thinks to have slain; such sacrifice he swore\nTo Artemis on that deep-bosomed shore.\nFor there Lord Agamemnon, hot with joy\nTo win for Greece the crown of conquered Troy,\nFor Menelaus' sake through all distress\nPursuing Helen's vanished loveliness,\nGathered his thousand ships from every coast\nOf Hellas: when there fell on that great host\nStorms and despair of sailing. Then the King\nSought signs of fire, and Calchas answering\nSpake thus: 'O Lord of Hellas, from this shore\nNo ship of thine may move for evermore,\nTill Artemis receive in gift of blood\nThy child, Iphigenia. Long hath stood\nThy vow, to pay to Her that bringeth light\nWhatever birth most fair by day or night\nThe year should bring. That year thy queen did bear\nA child—whom here I name of all most fair.\nSee that she die.'\nSo from my mother's side\nBy lies Odysseus won me, to be bride\nIn Aulis to Achilles. When I came,\nThey took me and above the altar flame\nHeld, and the sword was swinging to the gash,\nWhen, lo, out of their vision in a flash\nArtemis rapt me, leaving in my place\nA deer to bleed; and on through a great space\nOf shining sky upbore and in this town\nOf Tauris the Unfriended set me down;\nWhere o'er a savage people savagely\nKing Thoas rules. This is her sanctuary\nAnd I her priestess. Therefore, by the rite\nOf worship here, wherein she hath delight—\nThough fair in naught but name. … But Artemis\nIs near; I speak no further. Mine it is\nTo consecrate and touch the victim's hair;\nDoings of blood unspoken are the care\nOf others, where her inmost chambers lie.\nAh me!\nBut what dark dreams, thou clear and morning sky,\nI have to tell thee, can that bring them ease!\nMeseemed in sleep, far over distant seas,\nI lay in Argos, and about me slept\nMy maids: and, lo, the level earth was swept\nWith quaking like the sea. Out, out I fled,\nAnd, turning, saw the cornice overhead\nReel, and the beams and mighty door-trees down\nIn blocks of ruin round me overthrown.\nOne single oaken pillar, so I dreamed,\nStood of my father's house; and hair, meseemed,\nWaved from its head all brown: and suddenly\nA human voice it had, and spoke. And I,\nFulfilling this mine office, built on blood\nOf unknown men, before that pillar stood,\nAnd washed him clean for death, mine eyes astream\nWith weeping.\nAnd this way I read my dream.\nOrestes is no more: on him did fall\nMy cleansing drops.—The pillar of the hall\nMust be the man first-born; and they, on whom\nMy cleansing falls, their way is to the tomb.\nTherefore to my dead brother will I pour\nSuch sacrifice, I on this bitter shore\nAnd he beyond great seas, as still I may,\nWith all those maids whom Thoas bore away\nIn war from Greece and gave me for mine own.\nBut wherefore come they not? I must be gone\nAnd wait them in the temple, where I dwell.\n[She goes into the Temple.]\nVOICE.\nDid some one cross the pathway? Guard thee well.\nANOTHER VOICE.\nI am watching. Every side I turn mine eye.\n(Enter ORESTES and PYLADES. Their dress shows fhey are travellers ORESTES is shaken and distraught.)\nORESTES.\nHow, brother? And is this the sanctuary\nAt last, for which we sailed from Argolis?\nPYLADES.\nFor sure, Orestes. Seest thou not it is?\nORESTES.\nThe altar, too, where Hellene blood is shed.\nPYLADES.\nHow like long hair those blood-stains, tawny red!\nORESTES.\nAnd spoils of slaughtered men—there by the thatch.\nPYLADES.\nAye, first-fruits of the harvest, when they catch\nTheir strangers!—'Tis a place to search with care\n[He searches, while ORESTES sits.]\nORESTES.\nO God, where hast thou brought me? What new snare\nIs this?—I slew my mother; I avenged\nMy father at thy bidding; I have ranged\nA homeless world, hunted by shapes of pain,\nAnd circling trod in mine own steps again.\nAt last I stood once more before thy throne\nAnd cried thee question, what thing should be done\nTo end these miseries, wherein I reel\nThrough Hellas, mad, lashed like a burning wheel;\nAnd thou didst bid me seek … what land but this\nOf Tauri, where thy sister Artemis\nHer altar hath, and seize on that divine\nImage which fell, men say, into this shrine\nFrom heaven. This I must seize by chance or plot\nOr peril—clearer word was uttered not—\nAnd bear to Attic earth. If this be done,\nI should have peace from all my malison.\nLo, I have done thy will. I have pierced the seas\nWhere no Greek man may live.—Ho, Pylades,\nSole sharer of my quest: hast seen it all?\nWhat can we next? Thou seest this circuit wall\nEnormous? Must we climb the public stair,\nWith all men watching? Shall we seek somewhere\nSome lock to pick, some secret bolt or bar—\nOf all which we know nothing? Where we are,\nIf one man mark us, if they see us prize\nThe gate, or think of entrance anywise,\n'Tis death.—We still have time to fly for home:\nBack to the galley quick, ere worse things come!\nPYLADES.\nTo fly we dare not, brother. 'Twere a thing\nNot of our custom; and ill work, to bring\nGod's word to such reviling.—Let us leave\nThe temple now, and gather in some cave\nWhere glooms the cool sea ripple. But not where\nThe ship lies; men might chance to see her there\nAnd tell some chief; then certain were our doom.\nBut when the fringed eye of Night be come\nThen we must dare, by all ways foul or fine,\nTo thieve that wondrous Image from its shrine.\nAh, see; far up, between each pair of beams\nA hollow one might creep through! Danger gleams\nLike sunshine to a brave man's eyes, and fear\nOf what may be is no help anywhere.\nORESTES.\nAye; we have never braved these leagues of way\nTo falter at the end. See, I obey\nThy words. They are ever wise. Let us go mark\nSome cavern, to lie hid till fall of dark.\nGod will not suffer that bad things be stirred\nTo mar us now, and bring to naught the word\nHimself hath spoke. Aye, and no peril brings\nPardon for turning back to sons of kings.\n[They go out towards the shore. After they are gone, enter gradually the WOMEN]\nOF THE CHORUS.\nCHORUS.\nPeace! Peace upon all who dwell\nBy the Sister Rocks that clash in the swell\nOf the Friendless Seas.\nO Child of Leto, thou,\nDictynna mountain-born,\nTo the cornice gold-inlaid\nTo the pillared sanctities,\nWe come in the cold of morn,\nWe come with virgin brow,\nPure as our oath was sworn,\nHandmaids of thine handmaid\nWho holdeth the stainless keys,\nFrom Hellas, that once was ours,\nWe come before thy gate,\nFrom the land of the western seas,\nThe horses and the towers,\nThe wells and the garden trees,\nAnd the seats where our fathers sate.\nLEADER.\nWhat tidings, ho? With what intent\nHast called me to thy shrine and thee,\nO child of him who crossed the sea\nTo Troy with that great armament,\nThe thousand prows, the myriad swords?\nI come, O child of Atreid Lords.\n[IPHIGENIA, followed by ATTENDANTS, comes from the Temple.]\nIPHIGENIA.\nAlas, O maidens mine,\nI am filled full of tears:\nMy heart filled with the beat\nOf tears, as of dancing feet,\nA lyreless joyless line,\nAnd music meet for the dead.\nFor a whisper is in mine ears,\nBy visions borne on the breath\nOf the Night that now is fled,\nOf a brother gone to death.\nOh sorrow and weeping sore,\nFor the house that no more is,\nFor the dead that were kings of yore\nAnd the labour of Argolis!\n[She begins the Funeral Rite.]\nO Spirit, thou unknown,\nWho bearest on dark wings\nMy brother, my one, mine own,\nI bear drink-offerings,\nAnd the cup that bringeth ease\nFlowing through Earth's deep breast;\nMilk of the mountain kine,\nThe hallowed gleam of wine,\nThe toil of murmuring bees:\nBy these shall the dead have rest.\nTo an ATTENDANT.\nThe golden goblet let me pour,\nAnd that which Hades thirsteth for.\nO branch of Agamemnon's tree\nBeneath the earth, as to one dead,\nThis cup of love I pour to thee.\nOh, pardon, that I may not shed\nOne lock of hair to wreathe thy tomb,\nOne tear: so far, so far am I\nFrom what to me and thee was home,\nAnd where in all men's fantasy,\nButchered, O God! I also lie.\nCHORUS.\nWoe; woe: I too with refluent melody,\nAn echo wild of the dirges of the Asian,\nI, thy bond maiden, cry to answer thee:\nThe music that lieth hid in lamentation,\nThe song that is heard in the deep hearts of the dead,\nThat the Lord of dead men 'mid his dancing singeth,\nAnd never joy-cry, never joy it bringeth;\nWoe for the house of Kings in desolation,\nWoe for the light of the sceptre vanished.\nFrom kings in Argos of old, from joyous kings,\nThe beginning came:\nThen peril swift upon peril, flame on flame:\nThe dark and wheeling coursers, as wild with wings,\nThe cry of one betrayed on a drowning shore,\nThe sun that blanched in heaven, the world that\nchanged—\nEvil on evil and none alone!—deranged\nBy the Golden Lamb and the wrong grown ever more;\nBlood following blood, sorrow on sorrow sore!\nSo come the dead of old, the dead in wrath,\nBack on the seed of the high Tantalidae;\nSurely the Spirit of Life an evil path\nHath hewed for thee.\nIPHIGENIA.\nFrom the beginning the Spirit of my life\nWas an evil spirit. Alas for my mother's zone,\nAnd the night that bare me! From the beginning\nStrife,\nAs a book to read, Fate gave me for mine own.\nThey wooed a bride for the strikers down of Troy—\nThy first-born, Mother: was it for this, thy prayer?—\nA hind of slaughter to die in a father's snare,\nGift of a sacrifice where none hath joy.\nThey set me on a royal wane;\nDown the long sand they led me on,\nA bride new-decked, a bride of bane,\nIn Aulis to the Nereid's son.\nAnd now estranged for evermore\nBeyond the far estranging foam\nI watch a flat and herbless shore,\nUnloved, unchilded, without home\nOr city: never more to meet\nFor Hera's dance with Argive maids,\nNor round the loom 'mid singing sweet\nMake broideries and storied braids,\nOf writhing giants overthrown\nAnd clear-eyed Pallas … All is gone!\nRed hands and ever-ringing ears:\nThe blood of men that friendless die,\nThe horror of the strangers' cry\nUnheard, the horror of their tears.\nBut now, let even that have rest:\nI weep for him in Argos slain,\nThe brother whom I knew, Ah me,\nA babe, a flower; and yet to be—\nThere on his mother's arms and breast—\nThe crowned Orestes, lord of men!\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS.\nStay, yonder from some headland of the sea\nThere comes—methinks a herdsman, seeking thee.\n(Enter a HERDSMAN. IPHIGENIA is still on her knees.)\nHERDSMAN.\nDaughter of Clytemnestra and her king,\nGive ear! I bear news of a wondrous thing.\nIPHIGENIA.\nWhat news, that should so mar my obsequies?\nHERDSMAN.\nA ship hath passed the blue Symplegades,\nAnd here upon our coast two men are thrown,\nYoung, bold, good slaughter for the altar-stone\nOf Artemis!\n[SHE RISES.]\nMake all the speed ye may;\n'Tis not too much. The blood-bowl and the spray!\nIPHIGENIA.\nMen of what nation? Doth their habit show?\nHERDSMAN.\nHellenes for sure, but that is all we know.\nIPHIGENIA.\nNo name? No other clue thine ear could seize?\nHERDSMAN.\nWe heard one call his comrade 'Pylades.'\nIPHIGENIA.\nYes. And the man who spoke—his name was what?\nHERDSMAN.\nNone of us heard. I think they spoke it not.\nIPHIGENIA.\nHow did ye see them first, how make them fast?\nHERDSMAN.\nDown by the sea, just where the surge is cast …\nIPHIGENIA.\nThe sea? What is the sea to thee and thine?\nHERDSMAN.\nWe came to wash our cattle in the brine.\nIPHIGENIA.\nGo back, and tell how they were taken; show\nThe fashion of it, for I fain would know\nAll.—'Tis so long a time, and never yet,\nNever, hath Greek blood made this altar wet.\nHERDSMAN.\nWe had brought our forest cattle where the seas\nBreak in long tides from the Symplegades.\nA bay is there, deep eaten by the surge\nAnd hollowed clear, with cover by the verge\nWhere purple-fishers camp. These twain were there\nWhen one of mine own men, a forager,\nSpied them, and tiptoed whispering back: 'God save\nUs now! Two things unearthly by the wave\nSitting!' We looked, and one of pious mood\nRaised up his hands to heaven and praying stood:\n'Son of the white Sea Spirit, high in rule,\nStorm-lord Palaemon, Oh, be merciful:\nOr sit ye there the warrior twins of Zeus,\nOr something loved of Him, from whose great thews\nWas-born the Nereids' fifty-fluted choir.'\nAnother, flushed with folly and the fire\nOf lawless daring, laughed aloud and swore\n'Twas shipwrecked sailors skulking on the shore,\nOur rule and custom here being known, to slay\nAll strangers. And most thought this was the way\nTo follow, and seek out for Artemis\nThe blood-gift of our people.\nJust at this\nOne of the strangers started from his seat,\nAnd stood, and upward, downward, with a beat\nHis head went, and he groaned, and all his arm\nTrembled. Then, as a hunter gives alarm,\nHe shrieked, stark mad and raving: 'Pylades,\nDost see her there?—And there—Oh, no one sees!—\nA she-dragon of Hell, and all her head\nAgape with fanged asps, to bite me dead.\nShe hath no face, but somewhere from her cloak\nBloweth a wind of fire and bloody smoke:\nThe wings' beat fans it: in her arms, Ah see!\nMy mother, dead grey stone, to cast on me\nAnd crush … Help, help! They crowd on me\nbehind …'\nNo shapes at all were there. 'Twas his sick mind\nWhich turned the herds that lowed and barking hounds\nThat followed, to some visionary sounds\nOf Furies. For ourselves, we did but sit\nAnd watch in silence, wondering if the fit\nWould leave him dead. When suddenly out shone\nHis sword, and like a lion he leaped upon\nOur herds, to fight his Furies! Flank and side\nHe stabbed and smote them, till the foam was dyed\nRed at the waves' edge. Marry, when we saw\nThe cattle hurt and falling, no more law\nWe gave, but sprang to arms and blew the horn\nFor help—so strong they looked and nobly born\nFor thralls like us to meet, that pair unknown.\nWell, a throng gathered ere much time was gone;\nWhen suddenly the whirl of madness slips\nFrom off him and he falls, quite weak, his lips\nDropping with foam. When once we saw him fall\nSo timely, we were at him one and all\nTo pelt and smite. The other watched us come,\nBut knelt and wiped those lips all dank with foam\nAnd tended the sick body, while he held\nHis cloak's good web above him for a shield;\nSo cool he was to ward off every stone\nAnd all the while care for that stricken one.\nThen rose the fallen man, calm now and grave,\nLooked, and saw battle bursting like a wave\nThat bursts, and knew that peril close at hand\nWhich now is come, and groaned. On every hand\nWe stood, and stoned and stoned, and ceased not. Aye,\n'Twas then we heard that fearful battle-cry:\n'Ho, Pylades, 'tis death! But let it be\nA gallant death! Draw sword and follow me.'\nWhen those two swords came flashing, up the glen\nThrough the loose rocks we scattered back; but when\nOne band was flying, down by rocks and trees\nCame others pelting: did they turn on these,\nBack stole the first upon them, stone on stone.\n'Twas past belief: of all those shots not one\nStruck home. The goddess kept her fated prey\nPerfect. Howbeit, at last we made our way\nRight, left and round behind them on the sands,\nAnd rushed, and beat the swords out of their hands,\nSo tired they scarce could stand. Then to the king\nWe bore them both, and he, not tarrying,\nSends them to thee, to touch with holy spray—\nAnd then the blood-bowl!\nI have heard thee pray,\nPriestess, ere now for such a draft as this.\nAye, slay but these two chiefs to Artemis\nAnd Hellas shall have paid thy debt, and know\nWhat blood was spilt in Aulis long ago.\nLEADER.\nI marvel that one mad, whoe'er he be,\nShould sail from Hellas to the Friendless Sea.\nIPHIGENIA.\n'Tis well. Let thy hand bring them, and mine own\nShall falter not till here God's will be done.\n[EXIT HERDSMAN.]\nO suffering heart, not fierce thou wast of old\nTo shipwrecked men. Nay, pities manifold\nHeld thee in fancy homeward, lest thy hand\nAt last should fall on one of thine own land.\nBut now, for visions that have turned to stone\nMy heart, to know Orestes sees the sun\nNo more, a cruel woman waits you here,\nWhoe'er ye be, and one without a tear.\n'Tis true: I know by mine own evil will:\nOne long in pain, if things more suffering still\nFall to his hand, will hate them for his own\nTorment … And no great wind hath ever blown,\nNo ship from God hath passed the Clashing Gate,\nTo bring me Helen, who hath earned my hate,\nAnd Menelaus, till I mocked their prayers\nIn this new Aulis, that is mine, not theirs:\nWhere Greek hands held me lifted, like a beast\nFor slaughter, and my throat bled. And the priest\nMy father! … Not one pang have I forgot.\nAh me, the blind half-prisoned arms I shot\nThis way and that, to find his beard, his knees,\nGroping and wondering: 'Father, what are these\nFor bridal rites? My mother even now\nMid Argive women sings for me, whom thou …\nWhat dost thou? She sings happy songs, and all\nIs dance and sound of piping in the hall;\nAnd here … Is he a vampyre, is he one\nThat fattens on the dead, thy Peleus' son—\nWhose passion shaken like a torch before\nMy leaping chariot, lured me to this shore\nTo wed—'\nAh me! And I had hid my face,\nBurning, behind my veil. I would not press\nOrestes to my arms … who now is slain! …\nI would not kiss my sister's lips again,\nFor shame and fulness of the heart to meet\nMy bridegroom. All my kisses, all my sweet\nWords were stored up and hid: I should come back\nSo soon to Argos!\nAnd thou, too: alack,\nBrother, if dead thou art, from what high things\nThy youth is outcast, and the pride of kings\nFallen!\nAnd this the goddess deemeth good!\nIf ever mortal hand be dark with blood;\nNay, touch a new-made mother or one slain\nIn war, her ban is on him.

Hold your peace, O friends.\nOnward, still onward, to this shrine\nThey lead the first-fruits of the Greek.\n'Twas true, the tale he came to speak,\nThat watcher of the mountain kine.\nO holy one, if it afford\nThee joy, what these men bring to thee,\nTake thou their sacrifice, which we,\nBy law of Hellas, hold abhorred.\n[Enter ORESTES and PYLADES, bound, and guarded by\ntaurians. re-enter IPHIGENIA.]\nIPHIGENIA.\nSo be it.\nMy foremost care must be that nothing harms\nThe temple's holy rule.—Untie their arms.\nThat which is hallowed may no more be bound.\nYou, to the shrine within!

And your sister, if you have\nA sister: both at once, so young and brave\nTo leave her brotherless! Who knows when heaven\nMay send that fortune? For to none is given\nTo know the coming nor the end of woe;\nSo dark is God, and to great darkness go\nHis paths, by blind chance mazed from our ken.\nWhence are ye come, O most unhappy men?\nFrom some far home, methinks, ye have found this shore\nAnd far shall stay from home for evermore.\nORESTES.\nWhy weepest thou, woman, to make worse the smart\nOf that which needs must be, whoe'er thou art?\nI count it not for gentleness, when one\nWho means to slay, seeks first to make undone\nBy pity that sharp dread. Nor praise I him,\nWith hope long dead, who sheddeth tears to dim\nThe pain that grips him close. The evil so\nIs doubled into twain.

The truth! … From Argos art thou come?\nORESTES.\nMycenae, once a rich land, was my home.\nIPHIGENIA.\n'Tis banishment that brings thee here—or what?\nORESTES.\nA kind of banishment, half forced, half sought.\nIPHIGENIA.\nWouldst thou but tell me all I need of thee!\nORESTES.\n'Twere not much added to my misery.\nIPHIGENIA.\nFrom Argos! … Oh, how sweet to see thee here!\nORESTES.\nEnjoy it, then. To me 'tis sorry cheer.\nIPHIGENIA.\nThou knowest the name of Troy?

I too have some anger stored …\nORESTES.\nIn Sparta!

And 'tis thus most good things come to be,\nWhen different eyes hold the same for fair.\nStranger, if I can save thee, wilt thou bear\nTo Argos and the friends who loved my youth\nSome word? There is a tablet which, in truth\nFor me and mine ill works, a prisoner wrote,\nTa'en by the king in war. He knew 'twas not\nMy will that craved for blood, but One on high\nWho holds it righteous her due prey shall die.\nAnd since that day no Greek hath ever come\nWhom I could save and send to Argos home\nWith prayer for help to any friend: but thou,\nI think, dost loathe me not; and thou dost know\nMycenae and the names that fill my heart.\nHelp me! Be saved! Thou also hast thy part,\nSending Completed Page, Please Wait …\nIPHIGENIA.\n'Tis I. This altar's spell is over me.\nORESTES.\nA grievous office and unblest, O maid.\nIPHIGENIA.\nWhat dare I do? The law must be obeyed.\nORESTES.\nA girl to hold a sword and stab men dead!\nIPHIGENIA.\nI shall but sign the water on thy head.\nORESTES.\nAnd who shall strike me, if I needs must ask?\nIPHIGENIA.\nThere be within these vaults who know their task.\nORESTES.\nMy grave, when they have finished their desire?\nIPHIGENIA.\nA great gulf of the rock, and holy fire.\nORESTES.\nWoe's me!\nWould that my sister's hand could close mine eyes!\nIPHIGENIA.\nAlas, she dwelleth under distant skies,\nUnhappy one, and vain is all thy prayer.\nYet, Oh, them art from Argos: all of care\nThat can be, I will give and fail thee not.\nRich raiment to thy burial shall be brought,\nAnd oil to cool thy pyre in golden floods,\nAnd sweet that from a thousand mountain buds\nThe murmuring bee hath garnered, I will throw\nTo die with thee in fragrance. …\nI must go\nAnd seek the tablet from the Goddess' room\nWithin.—Oh, do not hate me for my doom!\nWatch them, ye servitors, but leave them free.\nIt may be, past all hoping, it may be,\nMy word shall sail to Argos, to his hand\nWhom most I love. How joyous will he stand\nTo know, past hope, that here on the world's rim\nHis dead are living, and cry out for him!\n[She goes into the Temple.]\nCHORUS.\nAlas, we pity thee; surely we pity thee: [Strophe.]\nWho art given over to the holy water,\nThe drops that fall deadly as drops of blood.\nORESTES.\nI weep not, ye Greek maidens: but farewell.\nCHORUS.\n[ANTISTROPHE.]\nAye, and rejoice with thee; surely rejoice with thee,\nThou happy rover from the place of slaughter;\nThy foot shall stand again where thy father's\nstood.\nPYLADES.\nWhile he I love must die? 'Tis miserable.\nDIVERS WOMEN OF THE CHORUS.\nA. Alas, the deathward faring of the lost!\nB. Woe, woe; thou too shalt move to misery.\nC Which one shall suffer most?\nD. My heart is torn by two words evenly,\nFor thee should I most sorrow, or for thee?\nORESTES.\nBy heaven, is THY thought, Pylades, like mine?\nPYLADES.\nO friend, I cannot speak.—But what is thine?\nORESTES.\nWho can the damsel be? How Greek her tone\nOf question, all of Ilion overthrown,\nAnd how the kings came back, the wizard flame\nOf Calchas, and Achilles' mighty name,\nAnd ill-starred Agamemnon. With a keen\nPity she spoke, and asked me of his queen\nAnd children … The strange woman comes from\nthere\nBy race, an Argive maid.—What aileth her\nWith tablets, else, and questionings as though\nHer own heart beat with Argos' joy or woe?\nPYLADES.\nThy speech is quicker, friend, else I had said\nThe same; though surely all men visited\nBy ships have heard the fall of the great kings.\nBut let that be: I think of other things …\nORESTES.\nWhat? If thou hast need of me, let it be said.\nPYLADES.\nI cannot live for shame if thou art dead.\nI sailed together with thee; let us die\nTogether. What a coward slave were I,\nCreeping through Argos and from glen to glen\nOf wind-torn Phocian hills! And most of men—\nFor most are bad—will whisper how one day\nI left my friend to die and made my way\nHome. They will say I watched the sinking breath\nOf thy great house and plotted for thy death\nTo wed thy sister, climb into thy throne…\nI dread, I loathe it.—Nay, all ways but one\nAre shut. My last breath shall go forth with thine,\nThy bloody sword, thy gulf of fire be mine\nAlso. I love thee and I dread men's scorn.\nORESTES.\nPeace from such thoughts! My burden can be borne;\nBut where one pain sufficeth, double pain\nI will not bear. Nay, all that scorn and stain\nThat fright thee, on mine own head worse would be\nIf I brought death on him who toiled for me.\nIt is no bitter thing for such an one\nAs God will have me be, at last to have done\nWith living. THOU art happy; thy house lies\nAt peace with God, unstained in men's eyes;\nMine is all evil fate and evil life …\nNay, thou once safe, my sister for thy wife—\nSo we agreed:—in sons of hers and thine\nMy name will live, nor Agamemnon's line\nBe blurred for ever like an evil scroll.\nBack! Rule thy land! Let life be in thy soul!\nAnd when thou art come to Hellas, and the plain\nOf Argos where the horsemen ride, again—\nGive me thy hand!—I charge thee, let there be\nSome death-mound and a graven stone for me.\nMy sister will go weep thereat, and shear\nA tress or two. Say how I ended here,\nSlain by a maid of Argolis, beside\nGod's altar, in mine own blood purified.\nAnd fare thee well. I have no friend like thee\nFor truth and love, O boy that played with me,\nAnd hunted on Greek hills, O thou on whom\nHath lain the hardest burden of my doom!\nFarewell. The Prophet and the Lord of Lies\nHath done his worst. Far out from Grecian skies\nWith craft forethought he driveth me, to die\nWhere none may mark how ends his prophecy!\nI trusted in his word. I gave him all\nMy heart. I slew my mother at his call;\nFor which things now he casts me here to die.\nPYLADES.\nThy tomb shall fail thee not. Thy sister I\nWill guard for ever. I, O stricken sore,\nWho loved thee living and shall love thee more\nDead. But for all thou standest on the brink,\nGod's promise hath not yet destroyed thee. Think!\nHow oft, how oft the darkest hour of ill\nBreaks brightest into dawn, if Fate but will!\nORESTES.\nEnough. Nor god nor man can any more\nAid me. The woman standeth at the door.\n[enter IPHIGENIA from the Temple.]\nIPHIGENIA.\nGo ye within; and have all things of need\nIn order set for them that do the deed.\nThere wait my word.\n[ATTENDANTS go in.]\nYe strangers, here I hold\nThe many-lettered tablet, fold on fold.\nYet … one thing still. No man, once unafraid\nAnd safe, remembereth all the vows he made\nIn fear of death. My heart misgiveth me,\nLest he who bears my tablet, once gone free,\nForget me here and set my charge at naught.\nORESTES.\nWhat wouldst thou, then? Thou hast some troubling thought.\nIPHIGENIA.\nHis sworn oath let him give, to bear this same\nTablet to Argos, to the friend I name.\nORESTES.\nAnd if he give this oath, wilt thou swear too?\nIPHIGENIA.\nWhat should I swear to do or not to do?\nORESTES.\nSend him from Tauris safe and free from ill.\nIPHIGENIA.\nI promise. How else could he do my will?\nORESTES.\nThe King will suffer this?\nIPHIGENIA.\nYes: I can bend\nThe King, and set upon his ship thy friend.\nORESTES.\nChoose then what oath is best, and he will swear.\nIPHIGENIA (to PYLADES, who has come up to her).\nSay: 'To thy friend this tablet I will bear.'\nPYLADES (TAKING THE TABLET).\nGood. I will bear this tablet to thy friend.\nIPHIGENIA.\nAnd I save thee beyond this kingdom's end.\nPYLADES.\nWhat god dost thou invoke to witness this?\nIPHIGENIA.\nHer in whose house I labour, Artemis.\nPYLADES.\nAnd I the Lord of Heaven, eternal Zeus.\nIPHIGENIA.\nAnd if thou fail me, or thine oath abuse …?\nPYLADES.\nMay I see home no more. And thou, what then?\nIPHIGENIA.\nMay this foot never tread Greek earth again.\nPYLADES.\nBut stay: there is one chance we have forgot.\nIPHIGENIA.\nA new oath can be sworn, if this serve not.\nPYLADES.\nIn one case set me free. Say I be crossed\nWith shipwreck, and, with ship and tablet lost\nAnd all I bear, my life be saved alone:\nLet not this oath be held a thing undone,\nTo curse me.\nIPHIGENIA.\nNay, then, many ways are best\nTo many ends. The words thou carriest\nEnrolled and hid beneath that tablet's rim,\nI will repeat to thee, and thou to him\nI look for. Safer so. If the scrip sail\nUnhurt to Greece, itself will tell my tale\nUnaided: if it drown in some wide sea,\nSave but thyself, my words are saved with thee.\nPYLADES.\nFor thy sake and for mine 'tis fairer so.\nNow let me hear his name to whom I go\nIn Argolis, and how my words should run.\nIPHIGENIA (REPEATING THE WORDS BY HEART).\nSay: 'To Orestes, Agamemnon's son\nShe that was slain in Aulis, dead to Greece\nYet quick, Iphigenia sendeth peace:'\nORESTES.\nIphigenia! Where? Back from the dead?\nIPHIGENIA.\n'Tis I. But speak not, lest thou break my thread.—\n'Take me to Argos, brother, ere I die,\nBack from the Friendless Peoples and the high\nAltar of Her whose bloody rites I wreak.'\nORESTES (ASIDE).\nWhere am I, Pylades? How shall I speak?\nIPHIGENIA.\n'Else one in grief forsaken shall, like shame,\nHaunt thee.'\nPYLADES (aside).\nOrestes!\nIPHIGENIA (overhearing him).\nYes: that is the name.\nPYLADES.\nYe Gods above!\nIPHIGENIA.\nWhy callest thou on God\nFor words of mine?\nPYLADES.\n'Tis nothing. 'Twas a road\nMy thoughts had turned. Speak on.—No need for us\nTo question; we shall hear things marvellous.\nIPHIGENIA.\nTell him that Artemis my soul did save,\nI wot not how, and to the altar gave\nA fawn instead; the which my father slew,\nNot seeing, deeming that the sword he drew\nStruck me. But she had borne me far away\nAnd left me in this land.—I charge thee, say\nSo much. It all is written on the scroll.\nPYLADES.\nAn easy charge thou layest on my soul,\nA glad oath on thine own. I wait no more,\nBut here fulfil the service that I swore.\nOrestes, take this tablet which I bear\nTo thine own hand, thy sister's messenger.\nORESTES.\nI take it, but I reck not of its scrip\nNor message. Too much joy is at my lip.\nSister! Beloved! Wildered though I be,\nMy arms believe not, yet they crave for thee.\nNow, filled with wonder, give me my delight!\n[he goes to embrace her. she stands speechless.]\nLEADER.\nStranger, forbear! No living man hath right\nTo touch that robe. The Goddess were defiled!\nORESTES.\nO Sister mine, O my dead father's child,\nAgamemnon's child; take me and have no fear,\nBeyond all dreams 'tis I thy brother here.\nIPHIGENIA.\nMy brother? Thou? … Peace! Mock at me no more.\nArgos is bright with him and Nauplia's shore.\nORESTES.\nUnhappy one! Thou hast no brother there.\nIPHIGENIA.\nOrestes … thou? Whom Clytemnestra bare?\nORESTES.\nTo Atreus' firstborn son, thy sire and mine.\nIPHIGENIA.\nThou sayst it: Oh, give me some proof, some sign!\nORESTES.\nWhat sign thou wilt. Ask anything from home.\nIPHIGENIA.\nNay, thou speak: 'tis from thee the sign should come.\nORESTES.\nThat will I.—First, old tales Electra told.\nThou knowest how Pelops' princes warred of old?\nIPHIGENIA.\nI know: the Golden Lamb that wrought their doom.\nORESTES.\nThine own hand wove that story on the loom…\nIPHIGENIA.\nHow sweet! Thou movest near old memories.\nORESTES.\nWith a great Sun back beaten in the skies.\nIPHIGENIA.\nFine linen threads I used. The memories come.\nORESTES.\nAnd mother gave thee shrift-water from home\nFor Aulis …\nIPHIGENIA.\nI remember. Not so fair\nA day did drink that water!\nORESTES.\nAnd thine hair\nThey brought us for thy dying gift, and gave\nTo mother.\nIPHIGENIA.\nYes: for record on the grave\nI sent it, where this head should never lie.\nORESTES.\nAnother token, seen of mine own eye.\nThe ancient lance that leapt in Pelops' hand,\nTo win his bride, the virgin of the land,\nAnd smite Oenomaus, in thy chamber hid …\nIPHIGENIA (falling into his arms).\nBeloved! Oh, no other, for indeed\nBeloved art thou! In mine arms at last,\nOrestes far away.\nORESTES.\nAnd thou in mine, the evil dreaming past,\nBack from the dead this day!\nYet through the joy tears, tears and sorrow loud\nAre o'er mine eyes and thine eyes, like a cloud.\nIPHIGENIA.\nIs this the babe I knew,\nThe little babe, light lifted like a bird?\nO heart of mine, too blest for any word,\nWhat shall I say or do?\nBeyond all wonders, beyond stories heard,\nThis joy is here and true.\nORESTES.\nCould we but stay thus joined for evermore!\nIPHIGENIA.\nA joy is mine I may not understand,\nFriends, and a fear, lest sudden from my hand\nThis dream will melt and soar\nUp to the fiery skies from whence it came.\nO Argos land, O hearth and holy flame\nThat old Cyclopes lit,\nI bless ye that he lives, that he is grown,\nA light and strength, my brother and mine own;\nI bless your name for it.\nORESTES.\nOne blood we are; so much is well. But Fate,\nSister, hath not yet made us fortunate.\nIPHIGENIA.\nO most unfortunate! Did I not feel,\nWhose father, misery-hearted, at my bare\nThroat held the steel?\nORESTES.\nWoe's me! Methinks even now I see thee there.\nIPHIGENIA.\nNo love-song of Achilles! Crafty arms\nDrew me to that cold sleep,\nAnd tears, blind tears amid the altar psalms\nAnd noise of them that weep—\nThat was my cleansing!\nORESTES.\nMy heart too doth bleed,\nTo think our father wrought so dire a deed.\nIPHIGENIA.\nMy life hath known no father. Any road\nTo any end may run,\nAs god's will drives; else …\nORESTES.\nElse, unhappy one,\nThyself had spilt this day thy brother's blood!\nIPHIGENIA.\nAh God, my cruel deed! … 'Twas horrible.\n'Twas horrible … O brother! Did my heart\nEndure it? … And things fell\nRight by so frail a chance; and here thou art.\nBloody my hand had been,\nMy heart heavy with sin.\nAnd now, what end cometh?\nShall Chance yet comfort me,\nFinding a way for thee\nBack from the Friendless Strand,\nBack from the place of death—\nEre yet the slayers come\nAnd thy blood sink in the sand—\nHome unto Argos, home? …\nHard heart, so swift to slay,\nIs there to life no way? …\nNo ship! … And how by land? …\nA rush of feet\nOut to the waste alone.\nNay: 'twere to meet\nDeath, amid tribes unknown\nAnd trackless ways of the waste …\nSurely the sea were best.\nBack by the narrow bar\nTo the Dark Blue Gate! …\nAh God, too far, too far! …\nDesolate! Desolate!\nWhat god or man, what unimagined flame,\nCan cleave this road where no road is, and bring\nTo us last wrecks of Agamemnon's name,\nPeace from long suffering?\nLEADER.\nLo, deeds of wonder and beyond surmise,\nNot as tales told, but seen of mine own eyes.\nPYLADES.\nMen that have found the arms of those they love\nWould fain long linger in the joy thereof.\nBut we, Orestes, have no respite yet\nFor tears or tenderness. Let us forget\nAll but the one word Freedom, calling us\nTo live, not die by altars barbarous.\nThink not of joy in this great hour, nor lose\nFortune's first hold. Not thus do wise men use.\nORESTES.\nI think that Fortune watcheth o'er our lives,\nSurer than we. But well said: he who strives\nWill find his gods strive for him equally.\nIPHIGENIA.\nHe shall not check us so, nor baffle me\nOf this one word. How doth Electra move\nThrough life? Ye twain are all I have to love.\nORESTES.\nA wife and happy: this man hath her hand.\nIPHIGENIA.\nAnd what man's son is he, and of what land?\nORESTES.\nSon of King Strophios he is called of men.\nIPHIGENIA.\nWhom Atreus' daughter wed?—My kinsman then.\nORESTES.\nOur cousin, and my true and only friend.\nIPHIGENIA.\nHe was not born, when I went to mine end.\nORESTES.\nNo, Strophios had no child for many a year.\nIPHIGENIA.\nI give thee hail, husband of one so dear.\nORESTES.\nMy more than kinsman, saviour in my need!\nIPHIGENIA.\nBut mother … Speak: how did ye dare that deed?\nORESTES.\nOur father's wrongs … But let that story be.\nIPHIGENIA.\nAnd she to slay her king! What cause had she?\nORESTES.\nForget her! … And no tale for thee it is.\nIPHIGENIA.\nSo be it.—And thou art Lord of Argolis?\nORESTES.\nOur uncle rules. I walk an exile's ways.\nIPHIGENIA.\nDoth he so trample on our fallen days?\nORESTES.\nNay: there be those that drive me, Shapes of Dread.\nIPHIGENIA.\nAh!\nThat frenzy on the shore! 'Tis as they said…\nORESTES.\nThey saw me in mine hour. It needs must be.\nIPHIGENIA.\n'Twas our dead mother's Furies hounding thee!\nORESTES.\nMy mouth is bloody with the curb they ride.\nIPHIGENIA.\nWhat brought thee here beyond the Friendless Tide?\nORESTES.\nWhat leads me everywhere—Apollo's word.\nIPHIGENIA.\nSeeking what end?—Or may the tale be heard?\nORESTES.\nNay, I can tell thee all. It needs must be\nThe whole tale of my days of misery.\nWhen this sore evil that we speak not of\nLit on my hand, this way and that they drove\nMy body, till the God by diverse paths\nLed me to Athens, that the nameless Wraths\nMight bring me before judgment. For that land\nA pure tribunal hath, where Ares' hand,\nRed from an ancient stain, by Zeus was sent\nFor justice. Thither came I; and there went\nGod's hate before me, that at first no man\nWould give me shelter. Then some few began\nTo pity, and set out for me aloof\nOne table. There I sate within their roof,\nBut without word they signed to me, as one\nApart, unspoken to, unlocked upon,\nLest touch of me should stain their meat and sup.\nAnd every man in measure filled his cup\nAnd gave me mine, and took their joy apart,\nWhile I sat silent; for I had no heart\nTo upbraid the hosts that fed me. On I wrought\nIn my deep pain, feigning to mark them not.\nAnd now, men say, mine evil days are made\nA rite among them and the cups are laid\nApart for each. The rule abideth still.\nHowbeit, when I was come to Ares' Hill\nThey gave me judgment. On one stone I stood,\nOn one she that was eldest of the brood\nThat hunted me so long. And many a word\nTouching my mother's death was spoke and heard,\nTill Phoebus rose to save me. Even lay\nThe votes of Death and Life; when, lo, a sway\nOf Pallas' arm, and free at last I stood\nFrom that death grapple. But the Shapes of Blood—\nSome did accept the judgment, and of grace\nConsent to make their house beneath that place\nIn darkness. Others still consented not,\nBut clove to me the more, like bloodhounds hot\nOn the dying; till to Phoebus' house once more\nI crept, and cast me starving on the floor\nFacing the Holy Place, and made my cry:\n'Lord Phoebus, here I am come, and here will die,\nUnless thou save me, as thou hast betrayed.'\nAnd, lo, from out that dark and golden shade\nA voice: 'Go, seek the Taurian citadel:\nSeize there the carven Artemis that fell\nFrom heaven, and stablish it on Attic soil.\nSo comes thy freedom.' [IPHIGENIA shrinks.]\nSister, in this toil\nHelp us!—If once that image I may win\nThat day shall end my madness and my sin:\nAnd thou, to Argos o'er the sundering foam\nMy many-oared barque shall bear thee home.\nO sister loved and lost, O pitying face,\nHelp my great peril; help our father's race.\nFor lost am I and perished all the powers\nOf Pelops, save that heavenly thing be ours!\nLEADER.\nStrange wrath of God hath fallen, like hot rain,\nOn Tantalus' house: he leadeth them through pain.\nIPHIGENIA.\nLong ere you came my heart hath yearned to be\nIn Argos, brother, and so near to thee:\nBut now—thy will is mine. To ease thy pain,\nTo lift our father's house to peace again,\nAnd hate no more my murderers—aye,'tis good.\nPerchance to clean this hand that sought thy blood,\nAnd save my people…\nBut the goddess' eyes,\nHow dream we to deceive them? Or what wise\nEscape the King, when on his sight shall fall\nThe blank stone of the empty pedestal? …\nI needs must die … What better can I do?\nAnd yet, one chance there is: could I but go\nTogether with the image: couldst thou bear\nBoth on the leaping seas! The risk were fair.\nBut how?\nNay, I must wait then and be slain:\nThou shalt walk free in Argolis again,\nAnd all life smile on thee … Dearest, we need\nNor shrink from that. I shall by mine own deed\nHave saved thee. And a man gone from the earth\nIs wept for. Women are but little worth.\nORESTES.\nMy mother and then thou? It may not be.\nThis hand hath blood enough. I stand with thee\nOne-hearted here, be it for life or death,\nAnd either bear thee, if God favoureth,\nWith me to Greece and home, or else lie here\nDead at thy side.—But mark me: if thou fear\nLest Artemis be wroth, how can that be?\nHath not her brother's self commanded me\nTo bear to Greece her image?—Oh, he knew\nHer will! He knew that in this land we two\nMust meet once more. All that so far hath past\nDoth show his work. He will not at the last\nFail. We shall yet see Argos, thou and I.\nIPHIGENIA.\nTo steal for thee the image, yet not die\nMyself! 'Tis that we need. 'Tis that doth kill\nMy hope. Else … Oh, God knows I have the will!\nORESTES.\nHow if we slew your savage king?\nIPHIGENIA.\nAh, no:\nHe sheltered me, a stranger.\nORESTES.\nEven so,\nIf it bring life for me and thee, the deed\nMay well be dared.\nIPHIGENIA.\nI could not … Nay; indeed\nI thank thee for thy daring.\nORESTES.\nCanst thou hide\nMy body in the shrine?\nIPHIGENIA.\nThere to abide\nTill nightfall, and escape?\nORESTES.\nEven so; the night\nIs the safe time for robbers, as the light\nFor just men.\nIPHIGENIA.\nThere be sacred watchers there\nWho needs must see us.\nORESTES.\nGods above! What prayer\nCan help us then?\nIPHIGENIA.\nI think I dimly see\nOne chance.\nORESTES.\nWhat chance? Speak out thy fantasy.\nIPHIGENIA'.\nOn thine affliction I would build my way.\nORESTES.\nWomen have strange devices.\nIPHIGENIA.\nI would say\nThou com'st from Hellas with thy mother's blood\nUpon thee.\nORESTES.\nUse my shame, if any good\nWill follow.\nIPHIGENIA.\nTherefore, an offence most high\nIt were to slay thee to the goddess!\nORESTES.\nWhy?\nThough I half guess.\nIPHIGENIA.\nThy body is unclean.—\nOh, I will fill them with the fear of sin!\nORESTES.\nWhat help is that for the Image?\nIPHIGENIA.\nI will crave\nTo cleanse thee in the breaking of the wave.\nORESTES.\nThat leaves the goddess still inside her shrine,\nAnd'tis for her we sailed.\nIPHIGENIA.\nA touch of thine\nDefiled her. She too must be purified.\nORESTES.\nWhere shall it be? Thou knowest where the tide\nSweeps up in a long channel?\nIPHIGENIA.\nYes! And where\nYour ship, I guess, lies moored.\nORESTES.\nWhose hand will bear—\nShould it be thine?—the image from her throne?\nIPHIGENIA.\nNo hand of man may touch it save mine own.\nORESTES.\nAnd Pylades—what part hath he herein?\nIPHIGENIA.\nThe same as thine. He bears the self-same sin.\nORESTES.\nHow wilt thou work the plan—hid from the king\nOr known?\nIPHIGENIA.\nTo hide it were a hopeless thing..\nOh, I will face him, make him yield to me.\nORESTES.\nWell, fifty oars lie waiting on the sea.\nIPHIGENIA.\nAye, there comes thy work, till an end be made.\nORESTES.\nGood. It needs only that these women aid\nOur secret. Do thou speak with them, and find\nWords of persuasion. Power is in the mind\nOf woman to wake pity.—For the rest,\nGod knoweth: may it all end for the best!\nIPHIGENIA.\nO women, you my comrades, in your eyes\nI look to read my fate. In you it lies,\nThat either I find peace, or be cast down\nTo nothing, robbed for ever of mine own—\nBrother, and home, and sister pricelessly\nBeloved.—Are we not women, you and I,\nA broken race, to one another true,\nAnd strong in our shared secrets? Help me through\nThis strait; keep hid the secret of our flight,\nAnd share our peril! Honour shineth bright\nOn her whose lips are steadfast … Heaven above!\nThree souls, but one in fortune, one in love,\nThou seest us go—is it to death or home?\nIf home, then surely, surely, there shall come\nPart of our joy to thee. I swear, I swear\nTo aid thee also home …\n[she goes to one after another, and presently kneels embracing the knees of the LEADER.]\nI make my prayer\nBy that right hand; to thee, too, by that dear\nCheek; by thy knees; by all that is not here\nOf things beloved, by mother, father, child—\nThou hadst a child!—How say ye? Have ye smiled\nOr turned from me? For if ye turn away,\nI and my brother are lost things this day.\nLEADER.\nBe of good heart, sweet mistress. Only go\nTo happiness.

THOAS goes into the Temple.]\nCHORUS. [STROPHE.]\nOh, fair the fruits of Leto blow:\nA Virgin, one, with joyous bow,\nAnd one a Lord of flashing locks,\nWise in the harp, Apollo:\nShe bore them amid Delian rocks,\nHid in a fruited hollow.\nBut forth she fared from that low reef,\nSea-cradle of her joy and grief.\nA crag she knew more near the skies\nAnd lit with wilder water,\nThat leaps with joy of Dionyse:\nThere brought she son and daughter.\nAnd there, behold, an ancient Snake,\nWine-eyed, bronze-gleaming in the brake\nOf deep-leaved laurel, ruled the dell,\nSent by old Earth from under\nStrange caves to guard her oracle—\nA thing of fear and wonder.\nThou, Phoebus, still a new-born thing,\nMeet in thy mother's arms to lie,\nDidst kill the Snake and crown thee king,\nIn Pytho's land of prophecy:\nThine was the tripod and the chair\nOf golden truth; and throned there,\nHard by the streams of Castaly,\nBeneath the untrodden portal\nOf Earth's mid stone there flows from thee\nWisdom for all things mortal.\n[ANTISTROPHE.]\nHe slew the Snake; he cast, men say,\nThemis, the child of Earth, away\nFrom Pytho and her hallowed stream;\nThen Earth, in dark derision,\nBrought forth the Peoples of the Dream\nAnd all the tribes of Vision.\nAnd men besought them; and from deep\nConfused underworlds of sleep\nThey showed blind things that erst had been\nAnd are and yet shall follow\nSo did avenge that old Earth Queen\nHer child's wrong on Apollo.\nThen swiftly flew that conquering one\nTo Zeus on high, and round the throne\nTwining a small indignant hand,\nPrayed him to send redeeming\nTo Pytho from that troublous band\nSprung from the darks of dreaming.\nZeus laughed to see the babe, I trow,\nSo swift to claim his golden rite;\nHe laughed and bowed his head, in vow\nTo still those voices of the night.\nAnd so from out the eyes of men\nThat dark dream-truth was lost again;\nAnd Phoebus, throneed where the throng\nPrays at the golden portal,\nAgain doth shed in sunlit song\nHope unto all things mortal.\n[enter a MESSENGER, running.]\nMESSENGER.\nHo, watchers of the fane! Ho, altar-guard,\nWhere is King Thoas gone? Undo the barred\nPortals, and call the King! The King I seek.\nLEADER.\nWhat tidings—if unbidden I may speak?\nMESSENGER.\nThe strangers both are gone, and we beguiled,\nBy some dark plot of Agamemnon's child:\nFled from the land! And on a barque of Greece\nThey bear the heaven-sent shape of Artemis.\nLEADER.\nThy tale is past belief.—Go, swiftly on,\nAnd find the King. He is but newly gone.\nMESSENGER.\nWhere went he?

They swore to me—and bade me cease\nMy search—the King was gone. And all the while …!\nTHOAS.\nThese women? How? What sought they by such guile?\nMESSENGER.\nOf them hereafter!—Give me first thine ear\nFor greater things. The virgin minister\nThat served our altar, she hath fled from this\nAnd stolen the dread Shape of Artemis,\nWith those two Greeks.

Not Clytemnestra's son?\nMESSENGER.\nAnd our pledged altar-offering. 'Tis the same.\nTHOAS.\nO marvel beyond marvel!

Let ear and sight\nBe mine awhile; and when thou hast heard the whole\nDevise how best to trap them ere the goal.\nTHOAS.\nAye, tell thy tale. Our Tauric seas stretch far,\nWhere no man may escape my wand of war.\nMESSENGER.\nSoon as we reached that headland of the sea,\nWhereby Orestes' barque lay secretly,\nWe soldiers holding, by thine own commands,\nThe chain that bound the strangers, in our hands,\nThere Agamemnon's daughter made a sign,\nBidding us wait far off, for some divine\nAnd secret fire of cleansing she must make.\nWe could but do her will. We saw her take\nThe chain in her own hands and walk behind.\nIndeed thy servants bore a troubled mind,\nO King, but how do else? So time went by.\nMeanwhile to make it seem she wrought some high\nMagic, she cried aloud: then came the long\nDrone of some strange and necromantic song,\nAs though she toiled to cleanse that blood; and there\nSat we, that long time, waiting. Till a fear\nO'ertook us, that the men might slip their chain\nAnd strike the priestess down and plunge amain\nFor safety: yet the dread our eyes to fill\nWith sights unbidden held us, and we still\nSat silent. But at last all spoke as one,\nForbid or not forbid, to hasten on\nAnd find them. On we went, and suddenly,\nWith oarage poised, like wings upon the sea,\nAn Argive ship we saw, her fifty men\nAll benched, and on the shore, with every chain\nCast off, our strangers, standing by the stern!\nThe prow was held by stay-poles: turn by turn\nThe anchor-cable rose; some men had strung\nLong ropes into a ladder, which they swung\nOver the side for those two Greeks to climb.\nThe plot was open, and we lost no time\nBut flew to seize the cables and the maid,\nAnd through the stern dragged out the steering-blade,\nTo spoil her course, and shouted: 'Ho, what way\nIs this, to sail the seas and steal away\nAn holy image and its minister?\nWhat man art them, and what man's son, to bear\nOur priestess from the land?' And clear thereon\nHe spoke: 'Orestes, Agamemnon's son,\nAnd brother to this maid, whom here in peace\nI bear, my long lost sister, back to Greece.'\nWe none the less clung fast to her, and strove\nTo drag her to thy judgment-seat. Thereof\nCame trouble and bruised jaws. For neither they\nNor we had weapons with us. But the way\nHard-beaten fist and heel from those two men\nRained upon ribs and flank—again, again…\nTo touch was to fall gasping! Aye, they laid\nTheir mark on all of us, till back we fled\nWith bleeding crowns, and some with blinded eyes,\nUp a rough bank of rock. There on the rise\nWe found good stones and stood, and fought again.\nBut archers then came out, and sent a rain\nOf arrows from the poop, and drove us back.\nAnd just then—for a wave came, long and black,\nAnd swept them shoreward—lest the priestess' gown\nShould feel the sea, Orestes stooping down\nCaught her on his left shoulder: then one stride\nOut through the sea, the ladder at the side\nWas caught, and there amid the benches stood\nThe maid of Argos and the carven wood\nOf heaven, the image of God's daughter high.\nAnd up from the mid galley rose a cry:\n'For Greece! For Greece, O children of the shores\nOf storm! Give way, and let her feel your oars;\nChurn the long waves to foam. The prize is won.\nThe prize we followed, on and ever on,\nFriendless beyond the blue Symplegades.'\nA roar of glad throats echoed down the breeze\nAnd fifty oars struck, and away she flew.\nAnd while the shelter lasted, she ran true\nFull for the harbour-mouth; but ere she well\nReached it, the weather caught her, and the swell\nWas strong. Then sudden in her teeth a squall\nDrove the sail bellying back. The men withal\nWorked with set teeth, kicking against the stream.\nBut back, still back, striving as in a dream,\nShe drifted. Then the damsel rose and prayed:\n'O Child of Leto, save thy chosen maid\nFrom this dark land to Hellas, and forgive\nMy theft this day, and let these brave men live.\nDost thou not love thy brother, Holy One?\nWhat marvel if I also love mine own?'\nThe sailors cried a paean to her prayers,\nAnd set those brown and naked arms of theirs,\nHalf-mad with strain, quick swinging chime on chime\nTo the helmsman's shout. But vainly; all the time\nNearer and nearer rockward they were pressed.\nOne of our men was wading to his breast,\nSome others roping a great grappling-hook,\nWhile I sped hot-foot to the town, to look\nFor thee, my Prince, and tell thee what doth pass.\nCome with me, Lord. Bring manacles of brass\nAnd bitter bonds. For now, unless the wave\nFall sudden calm, no mortal power can save\nOrestes. There is One that rules the sea\nWho grieved for Troy and hates her enemy:\nPoseidon's self will give into thine hand\nAnd ours this dog, this troubler of the land—\nThe priestess, too, who, recking not what blood\nRan red in Aulis, hath betrayed her god!\nLEADER.\nWoe, woe! To fall in these men's hands again,\nMistress, and die, and see thy brother slain!\nTHOAS.\nHo, all ye dwellers of my savage town\nSet saddle on your steeds, and gallop down\nTo watch the heads, and gather what is cast\nAlive from this Greek wreck. We shall make fast,\nBy God's help, the blasphemers.—Send a corps\nOut in good boats a furlong from the shore;\nSo we shall either snare them on the seas\nOr ride them down by land, and at our ease\nFling them down gulfs of rock, or pale them high\nOn stakes in the sun, to feed our birds and die.\nWomen: you knew this plot. Each one of you\nShall know, before the work I have to do\nIs done, what torment is.—Enough. A clear\nTask is afoot. I must not linger here.\n[While THOAS is moving off, his men shouting and running before and behind him, there comes a sudden blasting light and thunder- roll, and ATHENA is seen in the air confronting them.]\nATHENA.\nHo, whither now, so hot upon the prey,\nKing Thoas? It is I that bid thee stay,\nAthena, child of Zeus. Turn back this flood\nOf wrathful men, and get thee temperate blood.\nApollo's word and Fate's ordained path\nHave led Orestes here, to escape the wrath\nOf Them that Hate. To Argos he must bring\nHis sister's life, and guide that Holy Thing\nWhich fell from heaven, in mine own land to dwell.\nSo shall his pain have rest, and all be well.\nThou hast heard my speech, O King. No death from thee\nMay share Orestes between rocks and sea:\nPoseidon for my love doth make the sore\nWaves gentle, and set free his labouring oar.\nAnd thou, O far away—for, far or near\nA goddess speaketh and thy heart must hear—\nGo on thy ways, Orestes, bearing home\nThe Image and thy sister. When ye come\nTo god-built Athens, lo, a land there is\nHalf hid on Attica's last boundaries,\nA little land, hard by Karystus' Rock,\nBut sacred. It is called by Attic folk\nHalae. Build there a temple, and bestow\nTherein thine Image, that the world may know\nThe tale of Tauris and of thee, cast out\nFrom pole to pole of Greece, a blood-hound rout\nOf ill thoughts driving thee. So through the whole\nOf time to Artemis the Tauropole\nShall men make hymns at Halae. And withal\nGive them this law. At each high festival,\nA sword, in record of thy death undone,\nShall touch a man's throat, and the red blood run—\nOne drop, for old religion's sake. In this\nShall live that old red rite of Artemis.\nAnd them, Iphigenia, by the stair\nOf Brauron in the rocks, the Key shalt bear\nOf Artemis. There shalt thou live and die,\nAnd there have burial. And a gift shall lie\nAbove thy shrine, fair raiment undefiled\nLeft upon earth by mothers dead with child.\nYe last, O exiled women, true of heart\nAnd faithful found, ye shall in peace depart,\nEach to her home: behold Athena's will.\nOrestes, long ago on Ares' Hill\nI saved thee, when the votes of Death and Life\nLay equal: and henceforth, when men at strife\nSo stand, mid equal votes of Life and Death,\nMy law shall hold that Mercy conquereth.\nBegone. Lead forth thy sister from this shore\nIn peace; and thou, Thoas, be wroth no more.\nTHOAS.\nMost high Athena, he who bows not low\nHis head to God's word spoken, I scarce know\nHow such an one doth live. Orestes hath\nFled with mine Image hence … I bear no wrath.\nNor yet against his sister. There is naught,\nMethinks, of honour in a battle fought\n'Gainst gods. The strength is theirs. Let those two fare\nForth to thy land and plant mine Image there.\nI wish them well.\nThese bondwomen no less\nI will send free to Greece and happiness,\nAnd stay my galleys' oars, and bid this brand\nBe sheathed again, Goddess, at thy command.\nATHENA.\n'Tis well, O King. For that which needs must be\nHoldeth the high gods as it holdeth thee.\nWinds of the north, O winds that laugh and run,\nBear now to Athens Agamemnon's son:\nMyself am with you, o'er long leagues of foam\nGuiding my sister's hallowed Image home.\n[she floats away.]\nCHORUS. SOME WOMEN.\nGo forth in bliss, O ye whose lot\nGod shieldeth, that ye perish not!\nOTHERS.\nO great in our dull world of clay,\nAnd great in heaven's undying gleam,\nPallas, thy bidding we obey:\nAnd bless thee, for mine ears have heard\nThe joy and wonder of a word\nBeyond my dream, beyond my dream.",

    "content":"MEDEA\n[Pg 2]\nCHARACTERS OF THE PLAY\nMedea, daughter of Aiêtês, King of Colchis.\nJason, chief of the Argonauts; nephew of Pelias, King of Iôlcos in Thessaly.\nCreon, ruler of Corinth.\nAegeus, King of Athens.\nNurse of Medea.\nTwo Children of Jason and Medea.\nAttendant on the children.\nA Messenger.\nChorus of Corinthian Women, with their Leader.\nSoldiers and Attendants.\nThe scene is laid in Corinth. The play was first acted when Pythodôrus was Archon, Olympiad 87, year 1 (B.C. 431). Euphorion was first, Sophocles second, Euripides third, with Medea, Philoctêtes, Dictys, and the Harvesters, a Satyr-play.\n[Pg 3]\nMEDEA\nThe Scene represents the front of Medea's House in Corinth. A road to the right leads towards the royal castle, one on the left to the harbour. The Nurse is discovered alone.\nNurse.\nWould God no Argo e'er had winged the seas\nTo Colchis through the blue Symplêgades:\nNo shaft of riven pine in Pêlion's glen\nShaped that first oar-blade in the hands of men\nValiant, who won, to save King Pelias' vow,\nThe fleece All-golden! Never then, I trow,\nMine own princess, her spirit wounded sore\nWith love of Jason, to the encastled shore\nHad sailed of old Iôlcos: never wrought\nThe daughters of King Pelias, knowing not,\nTo spill their father's life: nor fled in fear,\nHunted for that fierce sin, to Corinth here\nWith Jason and her babes. This folk at need\nStood friend to her, and she in word and deed\nServed alway Jason. Surely this doth bind,\nThrough all ill days, the hurts of humankind,\nWhen man and woman in one music move.\nBut now, the world is angry, and true love\nSick as with poison. Jason doth forsake\nMy mistress and his own two sons, to make\n[Pg 4]  His couch in a king's chamber. He must wed:\nWed with this Creon's child, who now is head\nAnd chief of Corinth. Wherefore sore betrayed\nMedea calleth up the oath they made,\nThey two, and wakes the claspèd hands again,\nThe troth surpassing speech, and cries amain\nOn God in heaven to mark the end, and how\nJason hath paid his debt.\nAll fasting now\nAnd cold, her body yielded up to pain,\nHer days a waste of weeping, she hath lain,\nSince first she knew that he was false. Her eyes\nAre lifted not; and all her visage lies\nIn the dust. If friends will speak, she hears no more\nThan some dead rock or wave that beats the shore:\nOnly the white throat in a sudden shame\nMay writhe, and all alone she moans the name\nOf father, and land, and home, forsook that day\nFor this man's sake, who casteth her away.\nNot to be quite shut out from home . . . alas,\nShe knoweth now how rare a thing that was!\nMethinks she hath a dread, not joy, to see\nHer children near. 'Tis this that maketh me\nMost tremble, lest she do I know not what.\nHer heart is no light thing, and useth not\nTo brook much wrong. I know that woman, aye,\nAnd dread her! Will she creep alone to die\nBleeding in that old room, where still is laid\nLord Jason's bed? She hath for that a blade\nMade keen. Or slay the bridegroom and the king,\nAnd win herself God knows what direr thing?\n[Pg 5]  'Tis a fell spirit. Few, I ween, shall stir\nHer hate unscathed, or lightly humble her.\nHa! 'Tis the children from their games again,\nRested and gay; and all their mother's pain\nForgotten! Young lives ever turn from gloom!\n[The Children and their Attendant come in.\nAttendant.\nThou ancient treasure of my lady's room,\nWhat mak'st thou here before the gates alone,\nAnd alway turning on thy lips some moan\nOf old mischances? Will our mistress be\nContent, this long time to be left by thee?\nNurse.\nGrey guard of Jason's children, a good thrall\nHath his own grief, if any hurt befall\nHis masters. Aye, it holds one's heart! . . .\nMeseems\nI have strayed out so deep in evil dreams,\nI longed to rest me here alone, and cry\nMedea's wrongs to this still Earth and Sky.\nAttendant.\nHow? Are the tears yet running in her eyes?\nNurse.\n'Twere good to be like thee! . . . Her sorrow lies\nScarce wakened yet, not half its perils wrought.\nAttendant.\n[Pg 6]Mad spirit! . . . if a man may speak his thought\nOf masters mad.—And nothing in her ears\nHath sounded yet of her last cause for tears!\n[He moves towards the house, but the Nurse checks him.\nNurse.\nWhat cause, old man? . . . Nay, grudge me not one word.\nAttendant.\n'Tis nothing. Best forget what thou hast heard.\nNurse.\nNay, housemate, by thy beard! Hold it not hid\nFrom me. . . . I will keep silence if thou bid.\nAttendant.\nI heard an old man talking, where he sate\nAt draughts in the sun, beside the fountain gate,\nAnd never thought of me, there standing still\nBeside him. And he said, 'Twas Creon's will,\nBeing lord of all this land, that she be sent,\nAnd with her her two sons, to banishment.\nMaybe 'tis all false. For myself, I know\nNo further, and I would it were not so.\nNurse.\nJason will never bear it--his own sons\nBanished,—however hot his anger runs\nAgainst their mother!\n[Pg 7]Attendant.\nOld love burneth low\nWhen new love wakes, men say. He is not now\nHusband nor father here, nor any kin.\nNurse.\nBut this is ruin! New waves breaking in\nTo wreck us, ere we are righted from the old!\nAttendant.\nWell, hold thy peace. Our mistress will be told\nAll in good time. Speak thou no word hereof.\nNurse.\nMy babes! What think ye of your father's love?\nGod curse him not, he is my master still:\nBut, oh, to them that loved him, 'tis an ill\nFriend. . . .\nAttendant.\nAnd what man on earth is different? How?\nHast thou lived all these years, and learned but now\nThat every man more loveth his own head\nThan other men's? He dreameth of the bed\nOf this new bride, and thinks not of his sons.\nNurse.\nGo: run into the house, my little ones:\nAll will end happily! . . . Keep them apart:\nLet not their mother meet them while her heart\n[Pg 8]Is darkened. Yester night I saw a flame\nStand in her eye, as though she hated them,\nAnd would I know not what. For sure her wrath\nWill never turn nor slumber, till she hath . . .\nGo: and if some must suffer, may it be\nNot we who love her, but some enemy!\nVoice (within).\nOh shame and pain: O woe is me!\nWould I could die in my misery!\n[The Children and the Attendant go in.\nNurse.\nAh, children, hark! She moves again\nHer frozen heart, her sleeping wrath.\nIn, quick! And never cross her path,\nNor rouse that dark eye in its pain;\nThat fell sea-spirit, and the dire\nSpring of a will untaught, unbowed.\nQuick, now!—Methinks this weeping cloud\nHath in its heart some thunder-fire,\nSlow gathering, that must flash ere long.\nI know not how, for ill or well,\nIt turns, this uncontrollable\nTempestuous spirit, blind with wrong.\nVoice (within).\nHave I not suffered? Doth it call\nNo tears? . . . Ha, ye beside the wall\nUnfathered children, God hate you\nAs I am hated, and him, too,\nThat gat you, and this house and all!\n[Pg 9]Nurse.\nFor pity! What have they to do,\nBabes, with their father's sin? Why call\nThy curse on these? . . . Ah, children, all\nThese days my bosom bleeds for you.\nRude are the wills of princes: yea,\nPrevailing alway, seldom crossed,\nOn fitful winds their moods are tossed:\n'Tis best men tread the equal way.\nAye, not with glory but with peace\nMay the long summers find me crowned:\nFor gentleness—her very sound\nIs magic, and her usages.\nAll wholesome: but the fiercely great\nHath little music on his road,\nAnd falleth, when the hand of God\nShall move, most deep and desolate.\n[During the last words the Leader of the Chorus has entered. Other women follow her.\nLeader.\nI heard a voice and a moan,\nA voice of the eastern seas:\nHath she found not yet her ease?\nSpeak, O agèd one.\nFor I stood afar at the gate,\nAnd there came from within a cry,\n[Pg 10]             And wailing desolate.\nAh, no more joy have I,\nFor the griefs this house doth see,\nAnd the love it hath wrought in me.\nNurse.\nThere is no house! 'Tis gone. The lord\nSeeketh a prouder bed: and she\nWastes in her chamber, not one word\nWill hear of care or charity.\nVoice (within).\nO Zeus, O Earth, O Light,\nWill the fire not stab my brain?\nWhat profiteth living? Oh,\nShall I not lift the slow\nYoke, and let Life go,\nAs a beast out in the night,\nTo lie, and be rid of pain?\nChorus.\nSome Women\nA.\n'O Zeus, O Earth, O Light:'\nThe cry of a bride forlorn\nHeard ye, and wailing born\nOf lost delight?\n[Pg 11]B.\nWhy weariest thou this day,\nWild heart, for the bed abhorrèd,\nThe cold bed in the clay?\nDeath cometh though no man pray,\nUngarlanded, un-adorèd.\nCall him not thou.\nC.\nIf another's arms be now\nWhere thine have been,\nOn his head be the sin:\nRend not thy brow!\nD.\nAll that thou sufferest,\nGod seeth: Oh, not so sore\nWaste nor weep for the breast\nThat was thine of yore.\nVoice (within).\nVirgin of Righteousness,\nVirgin of hallowed Troth,\nYe marked me when with an oath\nI bound him; mark no less\nThat oath's end. Give me to see\nHim and his bride, who sought\nMy grief when I wronged her not,\nBroken in misery,\n[Pg 12]            And all her house. . . . O God,\nMy mother's home, and the dim\nShore that I left for him,\nAnd the voice of my brother's blood. . . .\nNurse.\nOh, wild words! Did ye hear her cry\nTo them that guard man's faith forsworn,\nThemis and Zeus? . . . This wrath new-born\nShall make mad workings ere it die.\nChorus.\nOther Women.\nA.\nWould she but come to seek\nOur faces, that love her well,\nAnd take to her heart the spell\nOf words that speak?\nB.\nAlas for the heavy hate\nAnd anger that burneth ever!\nWould it but now abate,\nAh God, I love her yet.\nAnd surely my love's endeavour\nShall fail not here.\nC.\nGo: from that chamber drear\nForth to the day\nLead her, and say, Oh, say\nThat we love her dear.\n[Pg 13]D.\nGo, lest her hand be hard\nOn the innocent: Ah, let be!\nFor her grief moves hitherward,\nLike an angry sea.\nNurse.\nThat will I: though what words of mine\nOr love shall move her? Let them lie\nWith the old lost labours! . . . Yet her eye—\nKnow ye the eyes of the wild kine,\nThe lion flash that guards their brood?\nSo looks she now if any thrall\nSpeak comfort, or draw near at all\nMy mistress in her evil mood.\n[The Nurse goes into the house.\nChorus.\nA Woman.\nAlas, the bold blithe bards of old\nThat all for joy their music made,\nFor feasts and dancing manifold,\nThat Life might listen and be glad.\nBut all the darkness and the wrong,\nQuick deaths and dim heart-aching things,\nWould no man ease them with a song\nOr music of a thousand strings?\n[Pg 14]         Then song had served us in our need.\nWhat profit, o'er the banquet's swell\nThat lingering cry that none may heed?\nThe feast hath filled them: all is well!\nOthers.\nI heard a song, but it comes no more.\nWhere the tears ran over:\nA keen cry but tired, tired:\nA woman's cry for her heart's desired,\nFor a traitor's kiss and a lost lover.\nBut a prayer, methinks, yet riseth sore\nTo God, to Faith, God's ancient daughter—\nThe Faith that over sundering seas\nDrew her to Hellas, and the breeze\nOf midnight shivered, and the door\nClosed of the salt unsounded water.\n[During the last words Medea has come out from the house.\nMedea.\nWomen of Corinth, I am come to show\nMy face, lest ye despise me. For I know\nSome heads stand high and fail not, even at night\nAlone—far less like this, in all men's sight:\nAnd we, who study not our wayfarings\nBut feel and cry—Oh we are drifting things,\nAnd evil! For what truth is in men's eyes,\nWhich search no heart, but in a flash despise\n[Pg 15]A strange face, shuddering back from one that ne'er\nHath wronged them? . . . Sure, far-comers anywhere,\nI know, must bow them and be gentle. Nay,\nA Greek himself men praise not, who alway\nShould seek his own will recking not. . . . But I—\nThis thing undreamed of, sudden from on high,\nHath sapped my soul: I dazzle where I stand,\nThe cup of all life shattered in my hand,\nLonging to die—O friends! He, even he,\nWhom to know well was all the world to me,\nThe man I loved, hath proved most evil.—Oh,\nOf all things upon earth that bleed and grow,\nA herb most bruised is woman. We must pay\nOur store of gold, hoarded for that one day,\nTo buy us some man's love; and lo, they bring\nA master of our flesh! There comes the sting\nOf the whole shame. And then the jeopardy,\nFor good or ill, what shall that master be;\nReject she cannot: and if he but stays\nHis suit, 'tis shame on all that woman's days.\nSo thrown amid new laws, new places, why,\n'Tis magic she must have, or prophecy—\nHome never taught her that—how best to guide\nToward peace this thing that sleepeth at her side.\nAnd she who, labouring long, shall find some way\nWhereby her lord may bear with her, nor fray\nHis yoke too fiercely, blessed is the breath\nThat woman draws! Else, let her pray for death.\nHer lord, if he be wearied of the face\nWithindoors, gets him forth; some merrier place\nWill ease his heart: but she waits on, her whole\nVision enchainèd on a single soul.\n[Pg 16]And then, forsooth, 'tis they that face the call\nOf war, while we sit sheltered, hid from all\nPeril!—False mocking! Sooner would I stand\nThree times to face their battles, shield in hand,\nThan bear one child.\nBut peace! There cannot be\nEver the same tale told of thee and me.\nThou hast this city, and thy father's home,\nAnd joy of friends, and hope in days to come:\nBut I, being citiless, am cast aside\nBy him that wedded me, a savage bride\nWon in far seas and left—no mother near,\nNo brother, not one kinsman anywhere\nFor harbour in this storm. Therefore of thee\nI ask one thing. If chance yet ope to me\nSome path, if even now my hand can win\nStrength to requite this Jason for his sin,\nBetray me not! Oh, in all things but this,\nI know how full of fears a woman is,\nAnd faint at need, and shrinking from the light\nOf battle: but once spoil her of her right\nIn man's love, and there moves, I warn thee well,\nNo bloodier spirit between heaven and hell.\nLeader.\nI will betray thee not. It is but just,\nThou smite him.—And that weeping in the dust\nAnd stormy tears, how should I blame them? . . .\nStay:\n'Tis Creon, lord of Corinth, makes his way\nHither, and bears, methinks, some word of weight.\n[Pg 17]Enter from the right Creon, the King, with armed Attendants.\nCreon.\nThou woman sullen-eyed and hot with hate\nAgainst thy lord, Medea, I here command\nThat thou and thy two children from this land\nGo forth to banishment. Make no delay:\nSeeing ourselves, the King, are come this day\nTo see our charge fulfilled; nor shall again\nLook homeward ere we have led thy children twain\nAnd thee beyond our realm's last boundary.\nMedea.\nLost! Lost!\nMine haters at the helm with sail flung free\nPursuing; and for us no beach nor shore\nIn the endless waters! . . . Yet, though stricken sore,\nI still will ask thee, for what crime, what thing\nUnlawful, wilt thou cast me out, O King?\nCreon.\nWhat crime? I fear thee, woman—little need\nTo cloak my reasons—lest thou work some deed\nOf darkness on my child. And in that fear\nReasons enough have part. Thou comest here\nA wise-woman confessed, and full of lore\nIn unknown ways of evil. Thou art sore\nIn heart, being parted from thy lover's arms.\nAnd more, thou hast made menace . . . so the alarms\n[Pg 18]But now have reached mine ear . . . on bride and groom,\nAnd him who gave the bride, to work thy doom\nOf vengeance. Which, ere yet it be too late,\nI sweep aside. I choose to earn thine hate\nOf set will now, not palter with the mood\nOf mercy, and hereafter weep in blood.\nMedea.\n'Tis not the first nor second time, O King,\nThat fame hath hurt me, and come nigh to bring\nMy ruin. . . . How can any man, whose eyes\nAre wholesome, seek to rear his children wise\nBeyond men's wont? Much helplessness in arts\nOf common life, and in their townsmen's hearts\nEnvy deep-set . . . so much their learning brings!\nCome unto fools with knowledge of new things,\nThey deem it vanity, not knowledge. Aye,\nAnd men that erst for wisdom were held high,\nFeel thee a thorn to fret them, privily\nHeld higher than they. So hath it been with me.\nA wise-woman I am; and for that sin\nTo divers ill names men would pen me in;\nA seed of strife; an eastern dreamer; one\nOf brand not theirs; one hard to play upon . . .\nAh, I am not so wondrous wise!—And now,\nTo thee, I am terrible! What fearest thou?\nWhat dire deed? Do I tread so proud a path—\nFear me not thou!—that I should brave the wrath\nOf princes? Thou: what has thou ever done\nTo wrong me? Granted thine own child to one\nWhom thy soul chose.—Ah, him out of my heart\nI hate; but thou, meseems, hast done thy part\n[Pg 19]Not ill. And for thine houses' happiness\nI hold no grudge. Go: marry, and God bless\nYour issues. Only suffer me to rest\nSomewhere within this land. Though sore oppressed,\nI will be still, knowing mine own defeat.\nCreon.\nThy words be gentle: but I fear me yet\nLest even now there creep some wickedness\nDeep hid within thee. And for that the less\nI trust thee now than ere these words began.\nA woman quick of wrath, aye, or a man,\nIs easier watching than the cold and still.\nUp, straight, and find thy road! Mock not my will\nWith words. This doom is passed beyond recall;\nNor all thy crafts shall help thee, being withal\nMy manifest foe, to linger at my side.\nMedea (suddenly throwing herself down and clinging to Creon).\nOh, by thy knees! By that new-wedded bride . . .\nCreon.\n'Tis waste of words. Thou shalt not weaken me.\nMedea.\nWilt hunt me? Spurn me when I kneel to thee?\nCreon.\n'Tis mine own house that kneels to me, not thou.\n[Pg 20]Medea.\nHome, my lost home, how I desire thee now!\nCreon.\nAnd I mine, and my child, beyond all things.\nMedea.\nO Loves of man, what curse is on your wings!\nCreon.\nBlessing or curse, 'tis as their chances flow.\nMedea.\nRemember, Zeus, the cause of all this woe!\nCreon.\nOh, rid me of my pains! Up, get thee gone!\nMedea.\nWhat would I with thy pains? I have mine own.\nCreon.\nUp: or, 'fore God, my soldiers here shall fling . . .\nMedea.\nNot that! Not that! . . . I do but pray, O King . . .\n[Pg 21]Creon.\nThou wilt not? I must face the harsher task?\nMedea.\nI accept mine exile. 'Tis not that I ask.\nCreon.\nWhy then so wild? Why clinging to mine hand?\nMedea (rising).\nFor one day only leave me in thy land\nAt peace, to find some counsel, ere the strain\nOf exile fall, some comfort for these twain,\nMine innocents; since others take no thought,\nIt seems, to save the babes that they begot.\nAh! Thou wilt pity them! Thou also art\nA father: thou hast somewhere still a heart\nThat feels. . . . I reck not of myself: 'tis they\nThat break me, fallen upon so dire a day.\nCreon.\nMine is no tyrant's mood. Aye, many a time\nEre this my tenderness hath marred the chime\nOf wisest counsels. And I know that now\nI do mere folly. But so be it! Thou\nShalt have this grace . . . But this I warn thee clear,\nIf once the morrow's sunlight find thee here\nWithin my borders, thee or child of thine,\nThou diest! . . . Of this judgment not a line\n[Pg 22]Shall waver nor abate. So linger on,\nIf thou needs must, till the next risen sun;\nNo further. . . . In one day there scarce can be\nThose perils wrought whose dread yet haunteth me.\n[Exit Creon with his suite.\nChorus.\nO woman, woman of sorrow,\nWhere wilt thou turn and flee?\nWhat town shall be thine to-morrow,\nWhat land of all lands that be,\nWhat door of a strange man's home?\nYea, God hath hunted thee,\nMedea, forth to the foam\nOf a trackless sea.\nMedea.\nDefeat on every side; what else?—But Oh,\nNot here the end is: think it not! I know\nFor bride and groom one battle yet untried,\nAnd goodly pains for him that gave the bride.\nDost dream I would have grovelled to this man,\nSave that I won mine end, and shaped my plan\nFor merry deeds? My lips had never deigned\nSpeak word with him: my flesh been never stained\nWith touching. . . . Fool, Oh, triple fool! It lay\nSo plain for him to kill my whole essay\nBy exile swift: and, lo, he sets me free\nThis one long day: wherein mine haters three\nShall lie here dead, the father and the bride\nAnd husband—mine, not hers! Oh, I have tried\n[Pg 23]So many thoughts of murder to my turn,\nI know not which best likes me. Shall I burn\nTheir house with fire? Or stealing past unseen\nTo Jason's bed—I have a blade made keen\nFor that—stab, breast to breast, that wedded pair?\nGood, but for one thing. When I am taken there,\nAnd killed, they will laugh loud who hate me. . . .\nNay,\nI love the old way best, the simple way\nOf poison, where we too are strong as men.\nAh me!\nAnd they being dead—what place shall hold me then?\nWhat friend shall rise, with land inviolate\nAnd trusty doors, to shelter from their hate\nThis flesh? . . . None anywhere! . . . A little more\nI needs must wait: and, if there ope some door\nOf refuge, some strong tower to shield me, good:\nIn craft and darkness I will hunt this blood.\nElse, if mine hour be come and no hope nigh,\nThen sword in hand, full-willed and sure to die,\nI yet will live to slay them. I will wend\nMan-like, their road of daring to the end.\nSo help me She who of all Gods hath been\nThe best to me, of all my chosen queen\nAnd helpmate, Hecatê, who dwells apart,\nThe flame of flame, in my fire's inmost heart:\nFor all their strength, they shall not stab my soul\nAnd laugh thereafter! Dark and full of dole\nTheir bridal feast shall be, most dark the day\nThey joined their hands, and hunted me away.\nAwake thee now, Medea! Whatso plot\nThou hast, or cunning, strive and falter not.\n[Pg 24]On to the peril-point! Now comes the strain\nOf daring. Shall they trample thee again?\nHow? And with Hellas laughing o'er thy fall\nWhile this thief's daughter weds, and weds withal\nJason? . . . A true king was thy father, yea,\nAnd born of the ancient Sun! . . . Thou know'st the way;\nAnd God hath made thee woman, things most vain\nFor help, but wondrous in the paths of pain.\n[Medea goes into the House.\nChorus.\nBack streams the wave on the ever running river:\nLife, life is changed and the laws of it o'ertrod.\nMan shall be the slave, the affrighted, the low-liver!\nMan hath forgotten God.\nAnd woman, yea, woman, shall be terrible in story:\nThe tales too, meseemeth, shall be other than of yore.\nFor a fear there is that cometh out of Woman and a glory,\nAnd the hard hating voices shall encompass her no more!\nThe old bards shall cease, and their memory that lingers\nOf frail brides and faithless, shall be shrivelled as with fire.\nFor they loved us not, nor knew us: and our lips were dumb, our fingers\nCould wake not the secret of the lyre.\n[Pg 25]Else, else, O God the Singer, I had sung amid their rages\nA long tale of Man and his deeds for good and ill.\nBut the old World knoweth—'tis the speech of all his ages—\nMan's wrong and ours: he knoweth and is still.\nSome Women.\nForth from thy father's home\nThou camest, O heart of fire,\nTo the Dark Blue Rocks, to the clashing foam,\nTo the seas of thy desire:\nTill the Dark Blue Bar was crossed;\nAnd, lo, by an alien river\nStanding, thy lover lost,\nVoid-armed for ever,\nForth yet again, O lowest\nOf landless women, a ranger\nOf desolate ways, thou goest,\nFrom the walls of the stranger.\nOthers.\nAnd the great Oath waxeth weak;\nAnd Ruth, as a thing outstriven,\nIs fled, fled, from the shores of the Greek,\nAway on the winds of heaven.\n[Pg 26]           Dark is the house afar,\nWhere an old king called thee daughter;\nAll that was once thy star\nIn stormy water,\nDark: and, lo, in the nearer\nHouse that was sworn to love thee,\nAnother, queenlier, dearer,\nIs thronèd above thee.\nEnter from the right Jason.\nJason.\nOft have I seen, in other days than these,\nHow a dark temper maketh maladies\nNo friend can heal. 'Twas easy to have kept\nBoth land and home. It needed but to accept\nUnstrivingly the pleasure of our lords.\nBut thou, for mere delight in stormy words,\nWilt lose all! . . . Now thy speech provokes not me.\nRail on. Of all mankind let Jason be\nMost evil; none shall check thee. But for these\nDark threats cast out against the majesties\nOf Corinth, count as veriest gain thy path\nOf exile. I myself, when princely wrath\nWas hot against thee, strove with all good will\nTo appease the wrath, and wished to keep thee still\nBeside me. But thy mouth would never stay\nFrom vanity, blaspheming night and day\nOur masters. Therefore thou shalt fly the land.\nYet, even so, I will not hold my hand\nFrom succouring mine own people. Here am I\nTo help thee, woman, pondering heedfully\n[Pg 27]Thy new state. For I would not have thee flung\nProvisionless away—aye, and the young\nChildren as well; nor lacking aught that will\nOf mine can bring thee. Many a lesser ill\nHangs on the heels of exile. . . . Aye, and though\nThou hate me, dream not that my heart can know\nOr fashion aught of angry will to thee.\nMedea.\nEvil, most evil! . . . since thou grantest me\nThat comfort, the worst weapon left me now\nTo smite a coward. . . . Thou comest to me, thou,\nMine enemy! (Turning to the Chorus.) Oh, say, how call ye this,\nTo face, and smile, the comrade whom his kiss\nBetrayed? Scorn? Insult? Courage? None of these:\n'Tis but of all man's inward sicknesses\nThe vilest, that he knoweth not of shame\nNor pity! Yet I praise him that he came . . .\nTo me it shall bring comfort, once to clear\nMy heart on thee, and thou shalt wince to hear.\nI will begin with that, 'twixt me and thee,\nThat first befell. I saved thee. I saved thee—\nLet thine own Greeks be witness, every one\nThat sailed on Argo—saved thee, sent alone\nTo yoke with yokes the bulls of fiery breath,\nAnd sow that Acre of the Lords of Death;\nAnd mine own ancient Serpent, who did keep\nThe Golden Fleece, the eyes that knew not sleep,\nAnd shining coils, him also did I smite\nDead for thy sake, and lifted up the light\n[Pg 28]That bade thee live. Myself, uncounsellèd,\nStole forth from father and from home, and fled\nWhere dark Iôlcos under Pelion lies,\nWith thee—Oh, single-hearted more than wise!\nI murdered Pelias, yea, in agony,\nBy his own daughters' hands, for sake of thee;\nI swept their house like War.—And hast thou then\nAccepted all—O evil yet again!—\nAnd cast me off and taken thee for bride\nAnother? And with children at thy side!\nOne could forgive a childless man. But no:\nI have borne thee children . . .\nIs sworn faith so low\nAnd weak a thing? I understand it not.\nAre the old gods dead? Are the old laws forgot,\nAnd new laws made? Since not my passioning,\nBut thine own heart, doth cry thee for a thing\nForsworn.\n[She catches sight of her own hand which she has\nthrown out to denounce him.\nPoor, poor right hand of mine, whom he\nDid cling to, and these knees, so cravingly,\nWe are unclean, thou and I; we have caught the stain\nOf bad men's flesh . . . and dreamed our dreams in vain.\nThou comest to befriend me? Give me, then,\nThy counsel. 'Tis not that I dream again\nFor good from thee: but, questioned, thou wilt show\nThe viler. Say: now whither shall I go?\nBack to my father? Him I did betray,\nAnd all his land, when we two fled away.\nTo those poor Peliad maids? For them 'twere good\nTo take me in, who spilled their father's blood. . . .\n[Pg 29]Aye, so my whole life stands! There were at home\nWho loved me well: to them I am become\nA curse. And the first friends who sheltered me,\nWhom most I should have spared, to pleasure thee\nI have turned to foes. Oh, therefore hast thou laid\nMy crown upon me, blest of many a maid\nIn Hellas, now I have won what all did crave,\nThee, the world-wondered lover and the brave;\nWho this day looks and sees me banished, thrown\nAway with these two babes, all, all, alone . . .\nOh, merry mocking when the lamps are red:\n'Where go the bridegroom's babes to beg their bread\nIn exile, and the woman who gave all\nTo save him?'\nO great God, shall gold withal\nBear thy clear mark, to sift the base and fine,\nAnd o'er man's living visage runs no sign\nTo show the lie within, ere all too late?\nLeader.\nDire and beyond all healing is the hate\nWhen hearts that loved are turned to enmity.\nJason.\nIn speech at least, meseemeth, I must be\nNot evil; but, as some old pilot goes\nFurled to his sail's last edge, when danger blows\nToo fiery, run before the wind and swell,\nWoman, of thy loud storms.—And thus I tell\nMy tale. Since thou wilt build so wondrous high\nThy deeds of service in my jeopardy,\n[Pg 30]To all my crew and quest I know but one\nSaviour, of Gods or mortals one alone,\nThe Cyprian. Oh, thou hast both brain and wit,\nYet underneath . . . nay, all the tale of it\nWere graceless telling; how sheer love, a fire\nOf poison-shafts, compelled thee with desire\nTo save me. But enough. I will not score\nThat count too close. 'Twas good help: and therefor\nI give thee thanks, howe'er the help was wrought.\nHowbeit, in my deliverance, thou hast got\nFar more than given. A good Greek land hath been\nThy lasting home, not barbary. Thou hast seen\nOur ordered life, and justice, and the long\nStill grasp of law not changing with the strong\nMan's pleasure. Then, all Hellas far and near\nHath learned thy wisdom, and in every ear\nThy fame is. Had thy days run by unseen\nOn that last edge of the world, where then had been\nThe story of great Medea? Thou and I . . .\nWhat worth to us were treasures heapèd high\nIn rich kings' rooms; what worth a voice of gold\nMore sweet than ever rang from Orpheus old,\nUnless our deeds have glory?\nSpeak I so,\nTouching the Quest I wrought, thyself did throw\nThe challenge down. Next for thy cavilling\nOf wrath at mine alliance with a king,\nHere thou shalt see I both was wise, and free\nFrom touch of passion, and a friend to thee\nMost potent, and my children . . . Nay, be still!\nWhen first I stood in Corinth, clogged with ill\n[Pg 31]From many a desperate mischance, what bliss\nCould I that day have dreamed of, like to this,\nTo wed with a king's daughter, I exiled\nAnd beggared? Not—what makes thy passion wild—\nFrom loathing of thy bed; not over-fraught\nWith love for this new bride; not that I sought\nTo upbuild mine house with offspring: 'tis enough,\nWhat thou hast borne: I make no word thereof:\nBut, first and greatest, that we all might dwell\nIn a fair house and want not, knowing well\nThat poor men have no friends, but far and near\nShunning and silence. Next, I sought to rear\nOur sons in nurture worthy of my race,\nAnd, raising brethren to them, in one place\nJoin both my houses, and be all from now\nPrince-like and happy. What more need hast thou\nOf children? And for me, it serves my star\nTo link in strength the children that now are\nWith those that shall be.\nHave I counselled ill?\nNot thine own self would say it, couldst thou still\nOne hour thy jealous flesh.—'Tis ever so!\nWho looks for more in women? When the flow\nOf love runs plain, why, all the world is fair:\nBut, once there fall some ill chance anywhere\nTo baulk that thirst, down in swift hate are trod\nMen's dearest aims and noblest. Would to God\nWe mortals by some other seed could raise\nOur fruits, and no blind women block our ways!\nThen had there been no curse to wreck mankind.\n[Pg 32]Leader.\nLord Jason, very subtly hast thou twined\nThy speech: but yet, though all athwart thy will\nI speak, this is not well thou dost, but ill,\nBetraying her who loved thee and was true.\nMedea.\nSurely I have my thoughts, and not a few\nHave held me strange. To me it seemeth, when\nA crafty tongue is given to evil men\n'Tis like to wreck, not help them. Their own brain\nTempts them with lies to dare and dare again,\nTill . . . no man hath enough of subtlety.\nAs thou—be not so seeming-fair to me\nNor deft of speech. One word will make thee fall.\nWert thou not false, 'twas thine to tell me all,\nAnd charge me help thy marriage path, as I\nDid love thee; not befool me with a lie.\nJason.\nAn easy task had that been! Aye, and thou\nA loving aid, who canst not, even now,\nStill that loud heart that surges like the tide!\nMedea.\nThat moved thee not. Thine old barbarian bride,\nThe dog out of the east who loved thee sore,\nShe grew grey-haired, she served thy pride no more.\n[Pg 33]Jason.\nNow understand for once! The girl to me\nIs nothing, in this web of sovranty\nI hold. I do but seek to save, even yet,\nThee: and for brethren to our sons beget\nYoung kings, to prosper all our lives again.\nMedea.\nGod shelter me from prosperous days of pain,\nAnd wealth that maketh wounds about my heart.\nJason.\nWilt change that prayer, and choose a wiser part?\nPray not to hold true sense for pain, nor rate\nThyself unhappy, being too fortunate.\nMedea.\nAye, mock me; thou hast where to lay thine head,\nBut I go naked to mine exile.\nJason.\nTread\nThine own path! Thou hast made it all to be.\nMedea.\nHow? By seducing and forsaking thee?\n[Pg 34]Jason.\nBy those vile curses on the royal halls\nLet loose. . . .\nMedea.\nOn thy house also, as chance falls,\nI am a living curse.\nJason.\nOh, peace! Enough\nOf these vain wars: I will no more thereof.\nIf thou wilt take from all that I possess\nAid for these babes and thine own helplessness\nOf exile, speak thy bidding. Here I stand\nFull-willed to succour thee with stintless hand,\nAnd send my signet to old friends that dwell\nOn foreign shores, who will entreat thee well.\nRefuse, and thou shalt do a deed most vain.\nBut cast thy rage away, and thou shalt gain\nMuch, and lose little for thine anger's sake.\nMedea.\nI will not seek thy friends. I will not take\nThy givings. Give them not. Fruits of a stem\nUnholy bring no blessing after them.\nJason.\nNow God in heaven be witness, all my heart\nIs willing, in all ways, to do its part\n[Pg 35]For thee and for thy babes. But nothing good\nCan please thee. In sheer savageness of mood\nThou drivest from thee every friend. Wherefore\nI warrant thee, thy pains shall be the more.\n[He goes slowly away.\nMedea.\nGo: thou art weary for the new delight\nThou wooest, so long tarrying out of sight\nOf her sweet chamber. Go, fulfil thy pride,\nO bridegroom! For it may be, such a bride\nShall wait thee,—yea, God heareth me in this—\nAs thine own heart shall sicken ere it kiss.\nChorus.\nAlas, the Love that falleth like a flood,\nStrong-winged and transitory:\nWhy praise ye him? What beareth he of good\nTo man, or glory?\nYet Love there is that moves in gentleness,\nHeart-filling, sweetest of all powers that bless.\nLoose not on me, O Holder of man's heart,\nThy golden quiver,\nNor steep in poison of desire the dart\nThat heals not ever.\nThe pent hate of the word that cavilleth,\nThe strife that hath no fill,\nWhere once was fondness; and the mad heart's breath\nFor strange love panting still:\nO Cyprian, cast me not on these; but sift,\nKeen-eyed, of love the good and evil gift.\n[Pg 36]       Make Innocence my friend, God's fairest star,\nYea, and abate not\nThe rare sweet beat of bosoms without war,\nThat love, and hate not.\nOthers.\nHome of my heart, land of my own,\nCast me not, nay, for pity,\nOut on my ways, helpless, alone,\nWhere the feet fail in the mire and stone,\nA woman without a city.\nAh, not that! Better the end:\nThe green grave cover me rather,\nIf a break must come in the days I know,\nAnd the skies be changed and the earth below;\nFor the weariest road that man may wend\nIs forth from the home of his father.\nLo, we have seen: 'tis not a song\nSung, nor learned of another.\nFor whom hast thou in thy direst wrong\nFor comfort? Never a city strong\nTo hide thee, never a brother.\nAh, but the man—cursèd be he,\nCursèd beyond recover,\nWho openeth, shattering, seal by seal,\nA friend's clean heart, then turns his heel,\nDeaf unto love: never in me\nFriend shall he know nor lover.\n[While Medea is waiting downcast, seated upon her door-step, there passes from the left a traveller with followers.

I shall lay those children dead—\nMine, whom no hand shall steal from me away!\nThen, leaving Jason childless, and the day\nAs night above him, I will go my road\nTo exile, flying, flying from the blood\nOf these my best-beloved, and having wrought\nAll horror, so but one thing reach me not,\nThe laugh of them that hate us.\nLet it come!\nWhat profits life to me? I have no home,\nNo country now, nor shield from any wrong.\nThat was my evil hour, when down the long\nHalls of my father out I stole, my will\nChained by a Greek man's voice, who still, oh, still,\nIf God yet live, shall all requited be.\nFor never child of mine shall Jason see\nHereafter living, never child beget\nFrom his new bride, who this day, desolate\nEven as she made me desolate, shall die\nShrieking amid my poisons. . . .

I sought to smooth away\nThe long strife with your father, and, lo, now\nI have all drowned with tears this little brow!\n[She wipes the child's face.\n[Pg 52]Leader.\nO'er mine eyes too there stealeth a pale tear:\nLet the evil rest, O God, let it rest here!\nJason.\nWoman, indeed I praise thee now, nor say\nIll of thine other hour. 'Tis nature's way,\nA woman needs must stir herself to wrath,\nWhen work of marriage by so strange a path\nCrosseth her lord. But thou, thine heart doth wend\nThe happier road. Thou hast seen, ere quite the end,\nWhat choice must needs be stronger: which to do\nShows a wise-minded woman. . . . And for you,\nChildren; your father never has forgot\nYour needs. If God but help him, he hath wrought\nA strong deliverance for your weakness. Yea,\nI think you, with your brethren, yet one day\nShall be the mightiest voices in this land.\nDo you grow tall and strong. Your father's hand\nGuideth all else, and whatso power divine\nHath alway helped him. . . . Ah, may it be mine\nTo see you yet in manhood, stern of brow,\nStrong-armed, set high o'er those that hate me. . . .\nHow?\nWoman, thy face is turned. Thy cheek is swept\nWith pallor of strange tears. Dost not accept\nGladly and of good will my benisons?\n[Pg 53]Medea.\n'Tis nothing. Thinking of these little ones. . . .\nJason.\nTake heart, then. I will guard them from all ill.\nMedea.\nI do take heart. Thy word I never will\nMistrust. Alas, a woman's bosom bears\nBut woman's courage, a thing born for tears.\nJason.\nWhat ails thee?—All too sore thou weepest there.\nMedea.\nI was their mother! When I heard thy prayer\nOf long life for them, there swept over me\nA horror, wondering how these things shall be.\nBut for the matter of my need that thou\nShould speak with me, part I have said, and now\nWill finish.—Seeing it is the king's behest\nTo cast me out from Corinth . . . aye, and best,\nFar best, for me—I know it—not to stay\nLonger to trouble thee and those who sway\nThe realm, being held to all their house a foe. . . .\nBehold, I spread my sails, and meekly go\n[Pg 54]To exile. But our children. . . . Could this land\nBe still their home awhile: could thine own hand\nBut guide their boyhood. . . . Seek the king, and pray\nHis pity, that he bid thy children stay!\nJason.\nHe is hard to move. Yet surely 'twere well done.\nMedea.\nBid her—for thy sake, for a daughters boon. . . .\nJason.\nWell thought! Her I can fashion to my mind.\nMedea.\nSurely. She is a woman like her kind. . . .\nYet I will aid thee in thy labour; I\nWill send her gifts, the fairest gifts that lie\nIn the hands of men, things of the days of old,\nFine robings and a carcanet of gold,\nBy the boys' hands.—Go, quick, some handmaiden,\nAnd fetch the raiment.\n[A handmaid goes into the house.\nAh, her cup shall then\nBe filled indeed! What more should woman crave,\nBeing wed with thee, the bravest of the brave,\n[Pg 55]And girt with raiment which of old the sire\nOf all my house, the Sun, gave, steeped in fire,\nTo his own fiery race?\n[The handmaid has returned bearing the Gifts.\nCome, children, lift\nWith heed these caskets. Bear them as your gift\nTo her, being bride and princess and of right\nBlessed!—I think she will not hold them light.\nJason.\nFond woman, why wilt empty thus thine hand\nOf treasure? Doth King Creon's castle stand\nIn stint of raiment, or in stint of gold?\nKeep these, and make no gift. For if she hold\nJason of any worth at all, I swear\nChattels like these will not weigh more with her.\nMedea.\nAh, chide me not! 'Tis written, gifts persuade\nThe gods in heaven; and gold is stronger made\nThan words innumerable to bend men's ways.\nFortune is hers. God maketh great her days:\nYoung and a crownèd queen! And banishment\nFor those two babes. . . . I would not gold were spent,\nBut life's blood, ere that come.\nMy children, go\nForth into those rich halls, and, bowing low,\nBeseech your father's bride, whom I obey,\nYe be not, of her mercy, cast away\n[Pg 56]Exiled: and give the caskets—above all\nMark this!—to none but her, to hold withal\nAnd keep. . . . Go quick! And let your mother know\nSoon the good tiding that she longs for. . . . Go!\n[She goes quickly into the house. Jason and the Children with their Attendant depart.\nChorus.\nNow I have no hope more of the children's living;\nNo hope more. They are gone forth unto death.\nThe bride, she taketh the poison of their giving:\nShe taketh the bounden gold and openeth;\nAnd the crown, the crown, she lifteth about her brow,\nWhere the light brown curls are clustering. No hope now!\nO sweet and cloudy gleam of the garments golden!\nThe robe, it hath clasped her breast and the crown her head.\nThen, then, she decketh the bride, as a bride of olden\nStory, that goeth pale to the kiss of the dead.\nFor the ring hath closed, and the portion of death is there;\nAnd she flieth not, but perisheth unaware.\nSome Women.\nO bridegroom, bridegroom of the kiss so cold,\nArt thou wed with princes, art thou girt with gold,\n[Pg 57]              Who know'st not, suing\nFor thy child's undoing,\nAnd, on her thou lovest, for a doom untold?\nHow art thou fallen from thy place of old!\nOthers.\nO Mother, Mother, what hast thou to reap,\nWhen the harvest cometh, between wake and sleep?\nFor a heart unslaken,\nFor a troth forsaken,\nLo, babes that call thee from a bloody deep:\nAnd thy love returns not. Get thee forth and weep!\n[Enter the Attendant with the two Children: Medea comes out from the house.\nAttendant.\nMistress, these children from their banishment\nAre spared. The royal bride hath mildly bent\nHer hand to accept thy gifts, and all is now\nPeace for the children.—Ha, why standest thou\nConfounded, when good fortune draweth near?\nMedea.\nAh God!\nAttendant.\nThis chimes not with the news I bear.\nMedea.\nO God, have mercy!\n[Pg 58]Attendant.\nIs some word of wrath\nHere hidden that I knew not of? And hath\nMy hope to give thee joy so cheated me?\nMedea.\nThou givest what thou givest: I blame not thee.\nAttendant.\nThy brows are all o'ercast: thine eyes are filled. . . .\nMedea.\nFor bitter need, Old Man! The gods have willed,\nAnd my own evil mind, that this should come.\nAttendant.\nTake heart! Thy sons one day will bring thee home.\nMedea.\nHome? . . . I have others to send home. Woe's me!\nAttendant.\nBe patient. Many a mother before thee\nHath parted from her children. We poor things\nOf men must needs endure what fortune brings.\n[Pg 59]Medea.\nI will endure.—Go thou within, and lay\nAll ready that my sons may need to-day.\n[The Attendant goes into the house.\nO children, children mine: and you have found\nA land and home, where, leaving me discrowned\nAnd desolate, forever you will stay,\nMotherless children! And I go my way\nTo other lands, an exile, ere you bring\nYour fruits home, ere I see you prospering\nOr know your brides, or deck the bridal bed,\nAll flowers, and lift your torches overhead.\nOh cursèd be mine own hard heart! 'Twas all\nIn vain, then, that I reared you up, so tall\nAnd fair; in vain I bore you, and was torn\nWith those long pitiless pains, when you were born.\nAh, wondrous hopes my poor heart had in you,\nHow you would tend me in mine age, and do\nThe shroud about me with your own dear hands,\nWhen I lay cold, blessèd in all the lands\nThat knew us. And that gentle thought is dead!\nYou go, and I live on, to eat the bread\nOf long years, to myself most full of pain.\nAnd never your dear eyes, never again,\nShall see your mother, far away being thrown\nTo other shapes of life. . . . My babes, my own,\nWhy gaze ye so?—What is it that ye see?—\nAnd laugh with that last laughter? . . . Woe is me,\nWhat shall I do?\nWomen, my strength is gone,\nGone like a dream, since once I looked upon\n[Pg 60]Those shining faces. . . . I can do it not.\nGood-bye to all the thoughts that burned so hot\nAforetime! I will take and hide them far,\nFar, from men's eyes. Why should I seek a war\nSo blind: by these babes' wounds to sting again\nTheir father's heart, and win myself a pain\nTwice deeper? Never, never! I forget\nHenceforward all I laboured for.\nAnd yet,\nWhat is it with me? Would I be a thing\nMocked at, and leave mine enemies to sting\nUnsmitten? It must be. O coward heart,\nEver to harbour such soft words!—Depart\nOut of my sight, ye twain.          [The Children go in.\nAnd they whose eyes\nShall hold it sin to share my sacrifice,\nOn their heads be it! My hand shall swerve not now.\nAh, Ah, thou Wrath within me! Do not thou,\nDo not. . . . Down, down, thou tortured thing, and spare\nMy children! They will dwell with us, aye, there\nFar off, and give thee peace.\nToo late, too late!\nBy all Hell's living agonies of hate,\nThey shall not take my little ones alive\nTo make their mock with! Howsoe'er I strive\nThe thing is doomed; it shall not escape now\nFrom being. Aye, the crown is on the brow,\nAnd the robe girt, and in the robe that high\nQueen dying.\nI know all. Yet . . . seeing that I\n[Pg 61]Must go so long a journey, and these twain\nA longer yet and darker, I would fain\nSpeak with them, ere I go.\n[A handmaid brings the Children out again.\nCome, children; stand\nA little from me. There. Reach out your hand,\nYour right hand—so—to mother: and good-bye!\n[She has kept them hitherto at arm's length: but\nat the touch of their hands, her resolution\nbreaks down, and she gathers them passionately\ninto her arms.\nOh, darling hand! Oh, darling mouth, and eye,\nAnd royal mien, and bright brave faces clear,\nMay you be blessèd, but not here! What here\nWas yours, your father stole. . . . Ah God, the glow\nOf cheek on cheek, the tender touch; and Oh,\nSweet scent of childhood. . . . Go! Go! . . . Am I blind? . . .\nMine eyes can see not, when I look to find\nTheir places. I am broken by the wings\nOf evil. . . . Yea, I know to what bad things\nI go, but louder than all thought doth cry\nAnger, which maketh man's worst misery.\n[She follows the Children into the house.\nChorus.\nMy thoughts have roamed a cloudy land,\nAnd heard a fierier music fall\nThan woman's heart should stir withal:\nAnd yet some Muse majestical,\nUnknown, hath hold of woman's hand,\nSeeking for Wisdom—not in all:\n[Pg 62]          A feeble seed, a scattered band,\nThou yet shalt find in lonely places,\nNot dead amongst us, nor our faces\nTurned alway from the Muses' call.\nAnd thus my thought would speak: that she\nWho ne'er hath borne a child nor known\nIs nearer to felicity:\nUnlit she goeth and alone,\nWith little understanding what\nA child's touch means of joy or woe,\nAnd many toils she beareth not.\nBut they within whose garden fair\nThat gentle plant hath blown, they go\nDeep-written all their days with care—\nTo rear the children, to make fast\nTheir hold, to win them wealth; and then\nMuch darkness, if the seed at last\nBear fruit in good or evil men!\nAnd one thing at the end of all\nAbideth, that which all men dread:\nThe wealth is won, the limbs are bred\nTo manhood, and the heart withal\nHonest: and, lo, where Fortune smiled,\nSome change, and what hath fallen? Hark!\n'Tis death slow winging to the dark,\nAnd in his arms what was thy child.\nWhat therefore doth it bring of gain\nTo man, whose cup stood full before,\n[Pg 63]          That God should send this one thing more\nOf hunger and of dread, a door\nSet wide to every wind of pain?\n[Medea comes out alone from the house.\nMedea.\nFriends, this long hour I wait on Fortune's eyes,\nAnd strain my senses in a hot surmise\nWhat passeth on that hill.—Ha! even now\nThere comes . . . 'tis one of Jason's men, I trow.\nHis wild-perturbèd breath doth warrant me\nThe tidings of some strange calamity.\n[Enter Messenger.\nMessenger.\nO dire and ghastly deed! Get thee away,\nMedea! Fly! Nor let behind thee stay\nOne chariot's wing, one keel that sweeps the seas. . . .\nMedea.\nAnd what hath chanced, to cause such flights as these?\nMessenger.\nThe maiden princess lieth—and her sire,\nThe king—both murdered by thy poison-fire.\nMedea.\nMost happy tiding! Which thy name prefers\nHenceforth among my friends and well-wishers.\n[Pg 64]Messenger.\nWhat say'st thou? Woman, is thy mind within\nClear, and not raving? Thou art found in sin\nMost bloody wrought against the king's high head,\nAnd laughest at the tale, and hast no dread?\nMedea.\nI have words also that could answer well\nThy word. But take thine ease, good friend, and tell,\nHow died they? Hath it been a very foul\nDeath, prithee? That were comfort to my soul.\nMessenger.\nWhen thy two children, hand in hand entwined,\nCame with their father, and passed on to find\nThe new-made bridal rooms, Oh, we were glad,\nWe thralls, who ever loved thee well, and had\nGrief in thy grief. And straight there passed a word\nFrom ear to ear, that thou and thy false lord\nHad poured peace offering upon wrath foregone.\nA right glad welcome gave we them, and one\nKissed the small hand, and one the shining hair:\nMyself, for very joy, I followed where\nThe women's rooms are. There our mistress . . . she\nWhom now we name so . . . thinking not to see\nThy little pair, with glad and eager brow\nSate waiting Jason. Then she saw, and slow\nShrouded her eyes, and backward turned again,\nSick that thy children should come near her. Then\n[Pg 65]Thy husband quick went forward, to entreat\nThe young maid's fitful wrath. 'Thou will not meet\nLove's coming with unkindness? Nay, refrain\nThy suddenness, and turn thy face again,\nHolding as friends all that to me are dear,\nThine husband. And accept these robes they bear\nAs gifts: and beg thy father to unmake\nHis doom of exile on them—for my sake.'\nWhen once she saw the raiment, she could still\nHer joy no more, but gave him all his will.\nAnd almost ere the father and the two\nChildren were gone from out the room, she drew\nThe flowerèd garments forth, and sate her down\nTo her arraying: bound the golden crown\nThrough her long curls, and in a mirror fair\nArranged their separate clusters, smiling there\nAt the dead self that faced her. Then aside\nShe pushed her seat, and paced those chambers wide\nAlone, her white foot poising delicately—\nSo passing joyful in those gifts was she!—\nAnd many a time would pause, straight-limbed, and wheel\nHer head to watch the long fold to her heel\nSweeping. And then came something strange. Her cheek\nSeemed pale, and back with crooked steps and weak\nGroping of arms she walked, and scarcely found\nHer old seat, that she fell not to the ground.\nAmong the handmaids was a woman old\nAnd grey, who deemed, I think, that Pan had hold\n[Pg 66]Upon her, or some spirit, and raised a keen\nAwakening shout; till through her lips was seen\nA white foam crawling, and her eyeballs back\nTwisted, and all her face dead pale for lack\nOf life: and while that old dame called, the cry\nTurned strangely to its opposite, to die\nSobbing. Oh, swiftly then one woman flew\nTo seek her father's rooms, one for the new\nBridegroom, to tell the tale. And all the place\nWas loud with hurrying feet.\nSo long a space\nAs a swift walker on a measured way\nWould pace a furlong's course in, there she lay\nSpeechless, with veilèd lids. Then wide her eyes\nShe oped, and wildly, as she strove to rise,\nShrieked: for two diverse waves upon her rolled\nOf stabbing death. The carcanet of gold\nThat gripped her brow was molten in a dire\nAnd wondrous river of devouring fire.\nAnd those fine robes, the gift thy children gave—\nGod's mercy!—everywhere did lap and lave\nThe delicate flesh; till up she sprang, and fled,\nA fiery pillar, shaking locks and head\nThis way and that, seeking to cast the crown\nSomewhere away. But like a thing nailed down\nThe burning gold held fast the anadem,\nAnd through her locks, the more she scattered them,\nCame fire the fiercer, till to earth she fell\nA thing—save to her sire—scarce nameable,\nAnd strove no more. That cheek of royal mien,\nWhere was it—or the place where eyes had been?\n[Pg 67]Only from crown and temples came faint blood\nShot through with fire. The very flesh, it stood\nOut from the bones, as from a wounded pine\nThe gum starts, where those gnawing poisons fine\nBit in the dark—a ghastly sight! And touch\nThe dead we durst not. We had seen too much.\nBut that poor father, knowing not, had sped,\nSwift to his daughter's room, and there the dead\nLay at his feet. He knelt, and groaning low,\nFolded her in his arms, and kissed her: 'Oh,\nUnhappy child, what thing unnatural hath\nSo hideously undone thee? Or what wrath\nOf gods, to make this old grey sepulchre\nChildless of thee? Would God but lay me there\nTo die with thee, my daughter!' So he cried.\nBut after, when he stayed from tears, and tried\nTo uplift his old bent frame, lo, in the folds\nOf those fine robes it held, as ivy holds\nStrangling among your laurel boughs. Oh, then\nA ghastly struggle came! Again, again,\nUp on his knee he writhed; but that dead breast\nClung still to his: till, wild, like one possessed,\nHe dragged himself half free; and, lo, the live\nFlesh parted; and he laid him down to strive\nNo more with death, but perish; for the deep\nHad risen above his soul. And there they sleep,\nAt last, the old proud father and the bride,\nEven as his tears had craved it, side by side.\nFor thee—Oh, no word more! Thyself will know\nHow best to baffle vengeance. . . . Long ago\nI looked upon man's days, and found a grey\nShadow. And this thing more I surely say,\n[Pg 68]That those of all men who are counted wise,\nStrong wits, devisers of great policies,\nDo pay the bitterest toll. Since life began,\nHath there in God's eye stood one happy man?\nFair days roll on, and bear more gifts or less\nOf fortune, but to no man happiness.\n[Exit Messenger.\nChorus.\nSome Women.\nWrath upon wrath, meseems, this day shall fall\nFrom God on Jason! He hath earned it all.\nOther Women.\nO miserable maiden, all my heart\nIs torn for thee, so sudden to depart\nFrom thy king's chambers and the light above\nTo darkness, all for sake of Jason's love!\nMedea.\nWomen, my mind is clear. I go to slay\nMy children with all speed, and then, away\nFrom hence; not wait yet longer till they stand\nBeneath another and an angrier hand\nTo die. Yea, howsoe'er I shield them, die\nThey must. And, seeing that they must, 'tis I\nShall slay them, I their mother, touched of none\nBeside. Oh, up and get thine armour on,\n[Pg 69]My heart! Why longer tarry we to win\nOur crown of dire inevitable sin?\nTake up thy sword, O poor right hand of mine,\nThy sword: then onward to the thin-drawn line\nWhere life turns agony. Let there be naught\nOf softness now: and keep thee from that thought,\n'Born of thy flesh,' 'thine own belovèd.' Now,\nFor one brief day, forget thy children: thou\nShalt weep hereafter. Though thou slay them, yet\nSweet were they. . . . I am sore unfortunate.\n[She goes into the house.\nChorus.\nSome Women.\nO Earth, our mother; and thou\nAll-seër, arrowy crown\nOf Sunlight, manward now\nLook down, Oh, look down!\nLook upon one accurst,\nEre yet in blood she twine\nRed hands—blood that is thine!\nO Sun, save her first!\nShe is thy daughter still,\nOf thine own golden line;\nSave her!

Alas the dear\nLife that was born in vain!\nWoman, what mak'st thou here,\nThou from beyond the Gate\nWhere dim Symplêgades\nClash in the dark blue seas,\nThe shores where death doth wait?\nWhy hast thou taken on thee,\nTo make us desolate,\nThis anger of misery\nAnd guilt of hate?\nFor fierce are the smitings back of blood once shed\nWhere love hath been: God's wrath upon them that kill,\nAnd an anguished earth, and the wonder of the dead\nHaunting as music still. . . .\n[A cry is heard within.\nA Woman.\nHark!

No scorn of mine can reach to thee,\nSuch iron is o'er thine eyes.

Call me what thing thou please,\nTigress or Skylla from the Tuscan seas:\nMy claws have gripped thine heart, and all things shine.\nJason.\nThou too hast grief. Thy pain is fierce as mine.\nMedea.\nI love the pain, so thou shalt laugh no more.\nJason.\nOh, what a womb of sin my children bore!\n[Pg 76]Medea.\nSons, did ye perish for your father's shame?\nJason.\nHow? It was not my hand that murdered them.\nMedea.\n'Twas thy false wooings, 'twas thy trampling pride.\nJason.\nThou hast said it! For thy lust of love they died.\nMedea.\nAnd love to women a slight thing should be?\nJason.\nTo women pure!—All thy vile life to thee!\nMedea.\nThink of thy torment.

    "content":"ORESTES.\nELECTRA.\nThere is no word so dreadful to relate, nor suffering, nor heaven-inflicted calamity, the burden of which human nature may not be compelled to bear. For Tantalus, the blest, (and I am not reproaching his fortune, when I say this,) the son of Jupiter, as they report, trembling at the rock which impends over his head, hangs in the air, and suffers this punishment, as they say indeed, because, although being a man, yet having the honor of a table in common with the Gods upon equal terms, he possessed an ungovernable tongue, a most disgraceful malady. He begat Pelops, and from him sprung Atreus, for whom the Goddess having carded the wool[1] spun the thread of contention, and doomed him to make war on Thyestes his relation; (why must I commemorate things unspeakable?) But Atreus then[2] killed his children—and feasted him. But from Atreus, for I pass over in silence the misfortunes which intervened, sprung Agamemnon, the illustrious, (if he was indeed illustrious,) and Menelaus; their mother Aërope of Crete. But Menelaus indeed marries Helen, the hated of the Gods, but King Agamemnon obtained Clytæmnestra's bed, memorable throughout the Grecians: from whom we virgins were born, three from one mother; Chrysothemis, and Iphigenia, and myself Electra; and Orestes the male part of the family, from a most unholy mother, who slew her husband, having covered him around with an inextricable robe; the reason however it is not decorous in a virgin to tell; I leave this undeclared for men to consider as they will. But why indeed must I accuse the injustice of Phœbus? Yet persuaded he Orestes to kill that mother that brought him forth, a deed which gained not a good report from all men. But nevertheless he did slay her, as he would not be disobedient to the God. I also took a share in the murder, but such as a woman ought to take. As did Pylades also who perpetrated this deed with us. From that time wasting away, the wretched Orestes is afflicted with a grievous malady, but falling on his couch there lies, but his mother's blood whirls him to frenzy (for I dread to mention those Goddesses, the Eumenides, who persecute him with terror). Moreover this is the sixth day since his slaughtered mother was purified by fire as to her body. During which he has neither taken any food down his throat, he has not bathed his limbs, but covered beneath his cloak, when indeed his body is lightened of its disease, on coming to his right mind he weeps, but at another time starts suddenly from his couch, as a colt from his yoke. But it has been decreed by this city of Argos, that no one shall receive us who have slain a mother under their roof, nor at their fire, and that none shall speak to us; but this is the appointed day, in the which the city of the Argives will pronounce their vote, whether it is fitting that we should die being stoned with stones, or having whet the sword, should plunge it into our necks. But I yet have some hope that we may not die, for Menelaus has arrived at this country from Troy, and filling the Nauplian harbor with his oars is mooring his fleet off the shore, having been lost in wanderings from Troy a long time: but the much-afflicted Helen has he sent before to our palace, having taken advantage of the night, lest any of those, whose children died under Ilium, when they saw her coming, by day, might go so far as to stone her; but she is within bewailing her sister, and the calamity of her family. She has however some consolation in her woes, for the virgin Hermione, whom Menelaus bringing from Sparta, left at our palace, when he sailed to Troy, and gave as a charge to my mother to bring up, in her she rejoices, and forgets her miseries. But I am looking at each avenue when I shall see Menelaus present, since, for the rest, we ride on slender power,[3] if we receive not some succor from him; the house of the unfortunate is an embarrassed state of affairs.\nELECTRA. HELEN.\nHEL. O daughter of Clytæmnestra and Agamemnon, O Electra, thou that hast remained a virgin a long time. How are ye, O wretched woman, both you, and your brother, the wretched Orestes (he was the murderer of his mother)? For by thy converse I am not polluted, transferring, as I do, the blame to Phœbus. And yet I groan the death of Clytæmnestra, whom, after that I sailed to Troy, (how did I sail, urged by the maddening fate of the Gods!) I saw not, but of her bereft I lament my fortune.\nELEC. Helen, why should I inform thee of things thou seest thyself here present, the race of Agamemnon in calamities. I indeed sleepless sit companion to the wretched corse, (for he is a corse, in that he breathes so little,) but at his fortune I murmur not. But thou a happy woman, and thy husband a happy man, have come to us, who fare most wretchedly.\nHEL. But what length of time has he been lying on his couch?\nELEC. Ever since he shed his parent's blood.\nHEL. Oh wretched, and his mother too, that thus she perished!\nELEC. These things are thus, so that he is unable to speak for misery.\nHEL. By the Gods wilt thou oblige me in a thing, O virgin?\nELEC. As far as I am permitted by the little leisure I have from watching by my brother.\nHEL. Wilt thou go to the tomb of my sister?\nELEC. My mother's tomb dost thou desire? wherefore?\nHEL. Bearing the first offerings of my hair, and my libations.\nELEC. But is it not lawful for thee to go to the tomb of thy friends?\nHEL. No, for I am ashamed to show myself among the Argives.\nELEC. Late art thou discreet, then formerly leaving thine home disgracefully.\nHEL. True hast thou spoken, but thou speakest not pleasantly to me.\nELEC. But what shame possesses thee among the Myceneans?\nHEL. I fear the fathers of those who are dead under Ilium.\nELEC. For this is a dreadful thing; and at Argos thou art declaimed against by every one's mouth.\nHEL. Do thou then grant me this favor, and free me from this fear.\nELEC. I can not look upon the tomb of my mother.\nHEL. And yet it is disgraceful for servants to bear these.\nELEC. But why not send thy daughter Hermione?\nHEL. It is not well for virgins to go among the crowd.\nELEC. And yet she might repay the dead the care of her education.\nHEL. Right hast thou spoken, and I obey thee, O virgin, and I will send my daughter, for thou sayest well. Come forth, my child Hermione, before the house, and take these libations in thine hand, and my hair, and, going to the tomb of Clytæmnestra, leave there this mixture of milk and honey, and the froth of wine, and standing on the summit of the mound, say thus: 'Helen, thy sister, presents thee with these libations, in fear herself to approach thy tomb, and afraid of the populace of Argos:' and bid her hold kind intentions toward me, and thyself, and my husband, and toward these two miserable persons whom the God has destroyed. But promise all the offerings to the manes, whatever it is fitting that I should perform for a sister. Go, my child, hasten, and when thou hast offered the libations at the tomb, remember to return back as speedily as possible.\nELEC. [alone] O Nature, what a great evil art thou among men, and the safeguard of those who possess thee, with virtue! For see, how she has shorn off the extremities of her hair, in order to preserve her beauty; but she is the same woman she always was. May the Gods detest thee, for that thou hast destroyed me, and this man, and the whole state of Greece: oh wretch that I am! But my dear friends that accompany me in my lamentations are again present; perhaps they will disturb the sleeper from his slumber, and will melt my eyes in tears when I behold my brother raving.\nELECTRA, CHORUS.\nELEC. O most dear woman, proceed with a gentle foot, make no noise, let there be heard no sound. For your friendliness is very kind, but to awake him will be a calamity to me. Hush, hush—gently advance the tread of thy sandal, make no noise, let there be heard no sound. Move onward from that place—onward from before the couch.\nCHOR. Behold, I obey.\nELEC. St! st! Speak to me, my friend, as the breathing of the soft reed pipe.\nCHOR. See, I utter a voice low as an under note.\nELEC. Ay, thus come hither, come hither, approach quietly—go quietly: tell me, for what purpose, I pray, are ye come? For he has fallen on his couch, and been sleeping some time.\nCHOR. How is he? Give us an account of him, my friend.\nELEC. What fortune can I say of him? and what his calamities? still indeed he breathes, but sighs at short intervals.\nCHOR. What sayest thou? Oh, the unhappy man!\nELEC. You will kill him if you move his eyelids, now that he is taking the sweetest enjoyment of sleep.\nCHOR. Unfortunate on account of these most angry deeds from heaven! oh! wretched on account of thy sufferings!\nELEC. Alas! alas! Apollo himself unjust, then spoke unjust things, when at the tripod of Themis he commanded the unhallowed, inauspicious murder of my mother.\nCHOR. Dost thou see? he moves his body in the robes that cover him.\nELEC. You by your cries, O wretch, have disturbed him from his sleep.\nCHOR. I indeed think he is sleeping yet.\nELEC. Will you not depart from us? will you not bend your footsteps back from the house, ceasing this noise?\nCHOR. He sleeps.\nELEC. Thou sayest well.\nCHOR. Venerable, venerable Night, thou that dispensest sleep to languid mortals, come from Erebus; come, come, borne on thy wings to the house of Agamemnon; for by our griefs and by our sufferings we are quite undone, undone.\nELEC. Ye were making a noise.\nCHOR. No. (Note [A].)\nELEC. Silently, silently repressing the high notes of your voice, apart from his couch, you will enable him to have the tranquil enjoyment of sleep.\nCHOR. Tell us; what end to his miseries awaits him?\nELEC. Death, death; what else can? for he has no appetite for food.\nCHOR. Death then is manifestly before him.\nELEC. Phœbus offered us as victims, when he commanded[4] the dreadful, abhorred murder of our mother, that slew our father.\nCHOR. With justice indeed, but not well.\nELEC. Thou hast died, thou hast died, O mother, O thou that didst bring me forth, but hast killed the father, and the children of thy blood. We perish, we perish, even as two corses. For thou art among the dead, and the greatest part of my life is passed in groans, and wailings, and nightly tears; marriageless, childless, behold, how like a miserable wretch do I drag out my existence forever!\nCHOR. O virgin Electra, approach near, and look that thy brother has not died unobserved by thee; for by this excessive quiet he doth not please me.\nORESTES, ELECTRA, CHORUS.\nORES. O precious balm of sleep, thou that relievest my malady, how pleasant didst thou come to me in the time of need! O divine oblivion of my sufferings, how wise thou art, and the goddess to be supplicated by all in distress!—whence, in heaven's name, came I hither? and how brought? for I remember not things past, bereaved, as I am, of my senses.\nELEC. My dearest brother, how didst thou delight me when thou didst fall asleep! wilt thou I touch thee, and raise thy body up?\nORES. Raise me then, raise me, and wipe the clotted foam from off my wretched mouth, and from my eyes.\nELEC. Behold, the task is sweet, and I refuse not to administer to a brother's limbs with a sister's hand.\nORES. Lay thy side by my side, and remove the squalid hair from my face, for I see but imperfectly with my eyes.\nELEC. O wretched head, sordid with ringlets, how art thou disordered from long want of the bath!\nORES. Lay me on the couch again; when my fit of madness gives me a respite, I am feeble and weak in my limbs.\nELEC. Behold, the couch is pleasant to the sick man, an irksome thing to keep, but still a necessary one.\nORES. Again raise me upright—turn my body.\nCHOR. Sick persons are hard to be pleased from their feebleness.\nELEC. Wilt thou set thy feet on the ground, putting forward thy long-discontinued[5] step? In all things change is sweet.\nORES. Yes, by all means; for this has a semblance of health, but the semblance is good, though it be distant from the truth.\nELEC. Hear now therefore, O my brother, while yet the Furies suffer thee to have thy right faculties.\nORES. Wilt thou tell any news? and if good indeed, thou art conferring pleasure; but if it pertain at all to mischief—I have enough distress.\nELEC. Menelaus has arrived, the brother of thy father, but his ships are moored in the Nauplian bay.\nORES. How sayest? Is he come, a light in mine and thy sufferings, a man of kindred blood, and that hath received benefits from our father?\nELEC. He is come; take this a sure proof of my words, bringing with him Helen from the walls of Troy.\nORES. Had he been saved alone, he had been more blest. But if he brings his wife, he has arrived with a mighty evil.\nELEC. Tyndarus begat an offspring of daughters, a conspicuous mark for blame, and infamous throughout Greece.\nORES. Do thou then be unlike the bad, for it is in thy power. And not only say, but also hold these sentiments.\nELEC. Alas! my brother, thine eye rolls wildly; quick art thou changed to madness, so late in thy senses.\nORES. O mother, I implore thee, urge not on me those Furies gazing blood, horrid with snakes, for these, these are leaping around me.\nELEC. Remain, O wretched man, calmly on thy couch, for thou seest none of those things, which thou fanciest thou seest plainly.\nORES. O Phœbus, these dire Goddesses in the shape of dogs will kill me, these gorgon-visaged ministers of hell.\nELEC. I will not let thee go, but, putting my arm around thee, will stop thy starting into those unfortunate convulsions.\nORES. Loose me. Thou art one of my Furies, and seizest me by the middle, that thou mayest hurl me into Tartarus.\nELEC. Oh! wretched me! what assistance can I obtain, since we have on us the vengeful wrath of heaven!\nORES. Give me my bow of horn, the gift of Phœbus, with which Apollo said I should repel the Fiends, if they appalled me by their maddened raging.\nELEC. Shall any God be wounded by mortal hand? (Note [B].)\nORES. Yes. She shall, if she will not depart from my sight... Hear ye not—see ye not the winged shafts impelled from the distant-wounding bow? Ha! ha! Why tarry ye yet? Skim the high air with your wings, and impeach the oracles of Phœbus.—Ah! why am I thus disquieted, heaving my panting breath from my lungs? Whither, whither have I wandered from my couch? For from the waves again I see a calm.—Sister, why weepest, hiding thine eyes beneath thy vests, I am ashamed to have thee a partner in my sufferings, and to give a virgin trouble through my malady. Pine not away on account of my miseries: for thou indeed didst assent to this, but the shedding of my mother's blood was accomplished by me: but I blame Apollo, who, after having instigated me to a most unholy act, with words indeed consoled me, but not with deeds. But I think that my father, had I, beholding him, asked him if it were right for me to slay my mother, would have put forth many supplications, beseeching me by this beard not to impel my sword to the slaughter of her who bore me, if neither he thereby could be restored to life, and I thus wretched must go through such miseries. And now then unveil thyself, my sister, and cease from tears, even though we be very miserable: but when thou seest me desponding, do thou restrain my distraction, and that which preys upon my mind, and console me; but when thou groanest, it becomes my duty to come to thee, and suggest words of comfort. For these are the good offices friends ought to render each other. But go thou into the house, O unfortunate sister, and, stretched at full length, compose thy sleepless eyelids to sleep, and take refreshment, and pour the bath upon thy fair skin. For if thou forsakest me, or gettest any illness by continually sitting by me, we perish; for thee I have my only succor, by the rest, as thou seest, abandoned.\nELEC. This can not be: with thee will I choose to die, with thee to live; for it is the same: for if then shouldst die, what can I do, a woman? how shall I be preserved, alone and destitute? without a brother, without a father, without a friend: but if it seemeth good to thee, these things it is my duty to do: but recline thy body on the bed, and do not to such a degree conceive to be real whatever frightens and startles thee from the couch, but keep quiet on the bed strewn for thee. For though thou be not ill, but only seem to be ill, still this even is an evil and a distress to mortals. (Note [C].)\nCHORUS. Alas! alas! O swift-winged, raving[6] Goddesses, who keep up the dance, not that of Bacchus, with tears and groans. You, dark Eumenides, you, that fly through the wide extended air, executing vengeance, executing slaughter, you do I supplicate, I supplicate: suffer the offspring of Agamemnon to forget his furious madness; alas! for his sufferings. What were they that eagerly grasping at, thou unhappy perishest, having received from the tripod the oracle which Phœbus spake, on that pavement, where are said to be the recesses in the midst of the globe! O Jupiter, what pity is there? what is this contention of slaughter that comes persecuting thee wretched, to whom some evil genius casts tear upon tear, transporting to thy house the blood of thy mother which drives thee frenzied! Thus I bewail, I bewail. Great prosperity is not lasting among mortals; but, as the sail of the swift bark, some deity having shaken him, hath sunk him in the voracious and destructive waves of tremendous evils, as in the waves of the ocean. For what other[6a] family ought I to reverence yet before that sprung from divine nuptials, sprung from Tantalus?—But lo! the king! the prince Menelaus, is coming! but he is very easily discernible from the elegance of his person, as king of the house of the Tantalidæ.\nO thou that didst direct the army of a thousand vessels to Asia's land, hail! but thou comest hither with good fortune, having obtained the object of thy wishes from the Gods.\nMENELAUS, ORESTES, CHORUS.\nMEN. O palace, in some respect indeed I behold thee with pleasure, coming from Troy, but in other respect I groan when I see thee. For never yet saw I any other house more completely encircled round with lamentable woes. For I was made acquainted with the misfortune that befell Agamemnon, [and his death, by what death he perished at the hands of his wife,][6b] when I was landing my ships at Malea; but from the waves the prophet of the mariners declared unto me, the foreboding Glaucus the son of Nereus, an unerring God, who told me thus in evident form standing by me. 'Menelaus, thy brother lieth dead, having fallen in his last bath, which his wife prepared.' But he filled both me and my sailors with many tears; but when I come to the Nauplian shore, my wife having already landed there, expecting to clasp in my friendly embraces Orestes the son of Agamemnon, and his mother, as being in prosperity, I heard from some fisherman[7] the unhallowed murder of the daughter of Tyndarus. And now tell me, maidens, where is the son of Agamemnon, who dared these terrible deeds of evil? for he was an infant in Clytæmnestra's arms at that time when I left the palace on my way to Troy, so that I should not know him, were I to see him.\nORES. I, Menelaus, am Orestes, whom thou seekest, I of my own accord will declare my evils. But first I touch thy knees in supplication, putting up prayers from my mouth, not using the sacred branch:[8] save me. But thou art come in the very season of my sufferings.\nMEN. O ye Gods, what do I behold! whom of the dead do I see!\nORES. Ay! well thou sayest the dead; for in my state of suffering I live not; but see the light.\nMEN. Thou wretched man, how disordered thou art in thy squalid hair!\nORES. Not the appearance, but the deeds torment me.\nMEN. But thou glarest dreadfully with thy shriveled eyeballs.\nORES. My body is vanished, but my name has not left me.\nMEN. Alas, thy uncomeliness of form which has appeared to me beyond conception!\nORES. I am he, the murderer of my wretched mother.\nMEN. I have heard; but spare a little the recital of thy woes.\nORES. I spare it; but in woes the deity is rich to me.\nMEN. What dost thou suffer? What malady destroys thee?\nORES. The conviction that I am conscious of having perpetrated dreadful deeds.\nMEN. How sayest thou? Plainness, and not obscurity, is wisdom.\nORES. Sorrow is chiefly what destroys me,—\nMEN. She is a dreadful goddess, but sorrow admits of cure.\nORES. And fits of madness in revenge for my mother's blood.\nMEN. But when didst first have the raging? what day was it then?\nORES. That day in which I heaped the tomb on my mother.\nMEN. What? in the house, or sitting at the pyre?\nORES. As I was guarding by night lest any one should bear off her bones.[9]\nMEN. Was any one else present, who supported thy body?\nORES. Pylades, who perpetrated with me the vengeance and death of my mother.\nMEN. But by what visions art thou thus afflicted?\nORES. I appear to behold three virgins like the night.\nMEN. I know whom thou meanest, but am unwilling to name them.\nORES. Yes: for they are awful; but forbear from speaking such high polished words.[10]\nMEN. Do these drive thee to distraction on account of this kindred murder?\nORES. Alas me for the persecutions, with which wretched I am driven!\nMEN. It is not strange that those who do strange deeds should suffer them.\nORES. But we have whereto we may transfer the criminality[11] of the mischance.\nMEN. Say not the death of thy father; for this is not wise.\nORES. Phœbus who commanded us to perpetrate the slaying of our mother.\nMEN. Being more ignorant than to know equity, and justice.\nORES. We are servants of the Gods, whatever those Gods be.\nMEN. And then does not Apollo assist thee in thy miseries?\nORES. He is always about to do it, but such are the Gods by nature.\nMEN. But how long a time has thy mother's breath gone from her?\nORES. This is the sixth day since; the funeral pyre is yet warm.\nMEN. How quickly have the Goddesses come to demand of thee thy mother's blood!\nORES. I am not wise, but a true friend to my friends.\nMEN. But what then doth the revenge of thy father profit thee?\nORES. Nothing yet; but I consider what is in prospect in the same light as a thing not done.\nMEN. But regarding the city how standest thou, having done these things?\nORES. We are hated to that degree, that no one speaks to us.\nMEN. Nor hast thou washed thy blood from thy hands according to the laws?\nORES. How can I? for I am shut out from the houses, whithersoever I go.\nMEN. Who of the citizens thus contend to drive thee from the land?\nORES. Œax,[12] imputing to my father the hatred which arose on account of Troy.\nMEN. I understand. The death of Palamede takes its vengeance on thee.\nORES. In which at least I had no share—but I perish by the three.\nMEN. But who else? Is it perchance one of the friends of Ægisthus?\nORES. They persecute me, whom now the city obeys.\nMEN. But does the city suffer thee to wield Agamemnon's sceptre?\nORES. How should they? who no longer suffer us to live.\nMEN. Doing what, which thou canst tell me as a clear fact?\nORES. This very day sentence will be passed upon us.\nMEN. To be exiled from this city? or to die? or not to die?\nORES. To die, by being stoned with stones by the citizens.\nMEN. And dost thou not fly then, escaping beyond the boundaries of the country?\nORES. How can we? for we are surrounded on every side by brazen arms.\nMEN. By private enemies, or by the hand of Argos?\nORES. By all the citizens, that I may die—the word is brief.\nMEN. O unhappy man! thou art come to the extreme of misfortune.\nORES. On thee my hope builds her escape from evils, but, thyself happy, coming among the distressed, impart thy good fortune to thy friends, and be not the only man to retain a benefit thou hast received, but undertake also services in thy turn, paying their father's kindness to those to whom thou oughtest. For those friends have the name, not the reality, who are not friends in adversity.\nCHOR. And see the Spartan Tyndarus is toiling hither with his aged foot, in a black vest, and shorn, his locks cut off in mourning for his daughter.\nORES. I am undone, O Menelaus! Lo! Tyndarus is coming toward us, to come before whose presence, most of all men's, shame covereth me, on account of what has been done. For he used to nurture me when I was little, and satiated me with many kisses, dandling in his arms Agamemnon's boy, and Leda with him, honoring me no less than the twin-born of Jove. For which, O my wretched heart and soul, I have given no good return: what dark veil can I take for my countenance? what cloud can I place before me, that I may avoid the glances of the old man's eyes?\nTYNDARUS, MENELAUS, ORESTES, CHORUS.\nTYND. Where, where can I see my daughter's husband Menelaus? For as I was pouring my libations on the tomb of Clytæmnestra, I heard that he was come to Nauplia with his wife, safe through a length of years. Conduct me, for I long to stand by his hand and salute him, seeing my friend after a long lapse of time.\nMEN. O hail! old man, who sharest thy bed with Jove.\nTYND. O hail! thou also, Menelaus my dear relation,—ah! what an evil is it not to know the future! This dragon here, the murderer of his mother, glares before the house his pestilential gleams—the object of my detestation—Menelaus, dost thou speak to this unholy wretch?\nMEN. Why not? he is the son of a father who was dear to me.\nTYND. What! was he sprung from him, being such as he is?\nMEN. He was; but, though he be unfortunate, he should be respected.\nTYND. Having been a long time with barbarians, thou art thyself turned barbarian.\nMEN. Nay! it is the Grecian fashion always to honor one of kindred blood.\nTYND. Yes, and also not to wish to be above the laws.\nMEN. Every thing proceeding from necessity is considered as subservient to her[13] among the wise.\nTYND. Do thou then keep to this, but I'll have none of it.\nMEN. No, for anger joined with thine age, is not wisdom.\nTYND. With this man what controversy can there be regarding wisdom? If what things are virtuous, and what are not virtuous, are plain to all, what man was ever more unwise that this man? who did not indeed consider justice, nor applied to the common existing law of the Grecians. For after that Agamemnon breathed forth his last, struck by my daughter on the head, a most foul deed (for never will I approve of this), it behooved him indeed to lay against her a sacred charge of bloodshed, following up the accusation, and to cast his mother from out of the house; and he would have taken the wise side in the calamity, and would have kept to law, and would have been pious. But now has he come to the same fate with his mother. For with justice thinking her wicked, himself has become more wicked in slaying his mother.\nBut thus much, Menelaus, will I ask thee; If the wife that shared his bed were to kill him, and his son again kills his mother in return, and he that is born of him shall expiate the murder with murder, whither then will the extremes of these evils proceed? Well did our fathers of old lay down these things; they suffered not him to come into the sight of their eyes, not to their converse, who was under an attainder[14] of blood; but they made him atone by banishment; they suffered however none to kill him in return. For always were one about to be attainted of murder, taking the pollution last into his hands. But I hate indeed impious women, but first among them my daughter, who slew her husband. But never will I approve of Helen thy wife, nor would I speak to her, neither do I commend[15] thee for going to the plain of Troy on account of a perfidious woman. But I will defend the law, as far at least as I am able, putting a stop to this brutish and murderous practice, which is ever destructive both of the country and the state.—For what feelings of humanity hadst thou, thou wretched man, when she bared her breast in supplication, thy mother? I indeed, though I witnessed not that scene of misery, melt in my aged eyes with tears through wretchedness. One thing however goes to the scale of my arguments; thou art both hated by the Gods, and sufferest vengeance of thy mother, wandering about with madness and terrors; why must I hear by the testimony of others, what it is in my power to see? That thou mayest know then once for all, Menelaus, do not things contrary to the Gods, through thy wishes to assist this man. But suffer him to be slain by the citizens with stones, or set not thy foot on Spartan ground. But my daughter in dying met with justice, but it was not fitting that she should die by him.[16] In other respects indeed have I been a happy man, except in my daughters, but in this I am not happy.\nCHOR. He is enviable, who is fortunate in his children, and has not on him some notorious calamities.\nORES. O old man, I tremble to speak to thee, wherein I am about to grieve thee and thy mind. But I am unholy in that I slew my mother; but holy at least in another point of view, having avenged my father. Let then thine age, which hinders me through fear from speaking, be removed out of the way of my words, and I will go on in a direct path; but now do I fear thy gray hairs. What could I do? for oppose the facts, two against two. My father indeed begat me, but thy daughter brought me forth, a field receiving the seed from another; but without a father there never could be a child. I reasoned therefore with myself, that I should assist the prime author of my birth rather than the aliment which under him produced me. But thy daughter (I am ashamed to call her mother), in secret and unchaste nuptials, had approached the bed of another man; of myself, if I speak ill of her, shall I be speaking, but yet will I tell it. Ægisthus was her secret husband in her palace. Him I slew, and after him I sacrificed my mother, doing indeed unholy things, but avenging my father. But as touching those things for which thou threatenest that I must be stoned, hear, how I shall assist all Greece. For if the women shall arrive at such a pitch of boldness as to murder the men, making good their escape with regard to their children, seeking to captivate their pity by their breasts, it would be as nothing with them to slay their husbands, having any pretext that might chance; but I having done dreadful things (as thou sayest), have put a stop to this law, but hating my mother deservedly I slew her, who betrayed her husband absent from home in arms, the generalissimo of the whole land of Greece, and kept not her bed undefiled. But when she perceived that she had done amiss, she inflicted not vengeance on herself, but, that she might not suffer vengeance from her husband, punished and slew my father. By the Gods, (in no good cause have I named the Gods, pleading against a charge of murder,) had I by my silence praised my mother's actions, what then would the deceased have done to me? To my mother indeed the Furies are present as allies, but would they not be present to him, who has received the greater injury? Would he not, detesting me, have haunted me with the Furies? Thou then, O old man, by begetting a bad daughter, hast destroyed me; for through her boldness deprived of my father, I became a matricide. Dost see? Telemachus slew not the wife of Ulysses, for she married not a husband on a husband, but her marriage-bed remains unpolluted in the palace. Dost see? Apollo, who, dwelling in his habitation in the midst of the earth, gives the most clear oracles to mortals, by whom we are entirely guided, whatever he may say, on him relying slew I my mother. 'Twas he who erred, not I: what could I do? Is not the God sufficient for me, who transfer the deed to him, to do away with the pollution? Whither then can any fly for succor, unless he that commanded me shall deliver me from death? But say not these things have been done 'not well;' but say 'not fortunately' for us who did them. But to whatsoever men their marriages are well established, there is a happy life, but to those to whom they fall not out well, with regard to their affairs both at home and abroad they are unfortunate.\nCHOR. Women were born always to be in the way of what may happen to men, to the making of things unfortunate.\nTYND. Since thou art bold, and yieldest not to my speech, but thus answerest me so as to grieve my mind, thou wilt rather inflame me to urge thy death. But this I shall consider a handsome addition to those labors for which I came, namely, to deck my daughter's tomb. For going to the multitude of the Argives assembled, I will rouse the state willing and not unwilling, to pass the sentence[16a] of being stoned on thee and on thy sister; but she is worthy of death rather than thee, who irritated thee against her mother, always pealing in thine ear words to increase thy hatred, relating dreams she had of Agamemnon, and this also, that the infernal Gods detested the bed of Ægisthus; for even here on earth it were hard to be endured; until she set the house in flames with fire more strong than Vulcan's.—Menelaus, but to thee I speak this, and will moreover perform it. If thou regard my hate, and my alliance, ward not off death from this man in opposition to the Gods; but suffer him to be slain by the citizens with stones, or set not thy foot on Spartan ground. Thus much having heard, depart, nor choose the impious for thy friends, passing over the pious.—But O attendants, conduct us from this house.\nORES. Depart, that the remainder of my speech may reach this man uninterrupted by the clamors of thy age: Menelaus, whither dost thou roam in thought, entering on a double path of double care?\nMEN. Suffer me; having some thoughts with myself, I am perplexed to which side of fortune to turn me.\nORES. Do not make up thy opinion, but having first heard my words, then deliberate.\nMEN. Say on; for thou hast spoken rightly; but there are seasons where silence may be better than talking, and there are seasons where talking may be better than silence.\nORES. I will speak then forthwith: Long speeches have the preference before short ones, and are more plain to hear. Give thou to me nothing of what thou hast, O Menelaus, but what thou hast received from my father, return; I mean not riches—yet riches, which are the most dear of what I possess, if thou wilt preserve my life. Say I am unjust, I ought to receive from thee, instead of this evil, something contrary to what justice demands; for Agamemnon my father having collected Greece in arms, in a way justice did not demand, went to Troy, not having erred himself, but in order to set right the error, and injustice of thy wife. This one thing indeed thou oughtest to give me for one thing, but he, as friends should for friends, of a truth exposed his person for thee toiling at the shield, that thou mightest receive back thy wife. Repay me then this kindness for that which thou receivedst there, toiling for one day in standing as my succor, not completing ten years. But the sacrifice of my sister, which Aulis received, this I suffer thee to have; do not kill Hermione, I ask it not. For, I being in the state in which I now am, thou must of necessity have the advantage, and I must suffer it to be so. But grant my life to my wretched father, and my sister's, who has been a virgin a long time. For dying I shall leave my father's house destitute. Thou wilt say 'impossible:' this is the very thing I have been urging, it behooves friends to help their friends in misfortunes. But when the God gives prosperity, what need is there of friends? For the God himself sufficeth, being willing to assist. Thou appearest to all the Greeks to be fond of thy wife; (and this I say, not stealing under thee imperceptibly with flattery;) by her I implore thee; O wretched me for my woes, to what have I come? but why must I suffer thus? For in behalf of the whole house I make this supplication. O divine brother of my father, conceive that the dead man beneath the earth hears these things, and that his spirit is hovering over thee, and speaks what I speak. These things have I said, with tears, and groans, and miseries,[17] and have prayed earnestly, looking for preservation, which all, and not I only, seek.\nCHOR. I too implore thee, although a woman, yet still I implore thee to succor those in need, but thou art able.\nMEN. Orestes, I indeed reverence thy person, and I am willing to labor with thee in thy misfortunes. For thus it is right to endure together the misfortunes of one's relations, if the God gives the ability, even so far as to die, and to kill the adversary; but this ability again I want from the Gods. For I am come having my single spear unaided by allies, having wandered with infinite labors with small assistance of friends left me. In battle therefore we can not come off superior to Pelasgian Argos; but if we can by soft speeches, to that hope are we equal. For how can any one achieve great actions with small means? For when the rabble is in full force falling into a rage, it is equally difficult to extinguish as a fierce fire. But if one quietly yields to it as it is spreading, and gives in to it, watching well his opportunity, perhaps it may spend its rage, but when it has remitted from its blast, you may without difficulty have it your own way, as much as you please. For there is inherent in them pity, but there is inherent also vehement passion, to one who carefully watches his opportunity a most excellent advantage. But I will go and endeavor to persuade Tyndarus, and the city, to use their great power in a becoming manner. For a ship, the main sheet stretched out to a violent degree, is wont to pitch, but stands upright again, if you slacken the main sheet. For the God hates too great vehemence, and the citizens hate it; but I must (I speak as I mean) save thee by wisdom, not by opposing my superiors. But I can not by force, as perchance thou thinkest, preserve thee; for it is no easy matter to erect from one single spear trophies from the evils, which are about thee. For never have we approached the land of Argos by way of supplication; but now there is necessity for the wise to become the slaves of fortune.\nORESTES, CHORUS.\nORES. O thou, a mere cipher in other things except in warring for the sake of a woman; O thou most base in avenging thy friends, dost thou fly, turning away from me? But all Agamemnon's services are gone: thou wert then without friends, O my father, in thy affliction. Alas me! I am betrayed, and there no longer are any hopes, whither turning I may escape death from the Argives. For he was the refuge of my safety. But I see this most dear of men, Pylades, coming with hasty step from the Phocians, a pleasing sight, a man faithful in adversity, more grateful to behold than the calm to the mariners.\nPYLADES, ORESTES, CHORUS.\nPYL. I came through the city with a quicker step than I ought, having heard of the council of state assembled, and seeing it plainly myself, against thee and thy sister, as about to kill you instantly.—What is this? how art thou? in what state, O most dear to me of my companions and kindred? for all these things art thou to me.\nORES. We are gone—briefly to show thee my calamities.\nPYL. Thou wilt have ruined me too; for the things of friends are common.\nORES. Menelaus has behaved most basely toward me and my sister.\nPYL. It is to be expected that the husband of a bad wife be bad.\nORES. He is come, and has done just as much for me as if he had not come.\nPYL. What! is he in truth come to this land?\nORES. After a long season; but nevertheless he was very soon discovered to be too base to his friends.\nPYL. And has he brought in his ship with him his most infamous wife?\nORES. Not he her, but she brought him hither.\nPYL. Where is she, who, beyond any woman,[18] destroyed most of the Grecians?\nORES. In my palace, if I may indeed be allowed to call this mine.\nPYL. But what words didst thou say to thy father's brother?\nORES. I requested him not to suffer me and my sister to be slain by the citizens.\nPYL. By the Gods, what said he to this request; this I wish to know.\nORES. He declined, from motives of prudence, as bad friends act toward their friends.\nPYL. Going on what ground of excuse? This having learned, I am in possession of every thing.\nORES. The father himself came, he that begat such excellent daughters.\nPYL. Tyndarus you mean; perhaps enraged with thee on account of his daughter.\nORES. You are right: be paid more attention to his ties with him, than to his ties with my father.\nPYL. And dared he not, being present, to take arms against thy troubles?\nORES. No: for he was not born a warrior, but brave among women.\nPYL. Thou art then in the greatest miseries, and it is necessary for thee to die.\nORES. The citizens must pass their vote on us for the murder we have committed.[19]\nPYL. Which vote what will it decide? tell me, for I am in fear.\nORES. Either to die or live; not many words on matters of great import.\nPYL. Come fly, and quit the palace with thy sister.\nORES. Seest thou not? we are watched by guards on every side,\nPYL. I saw the streets of the city lined with arms.\nORES. We are invested as to our persons, as a city by the enemy.\nPYL. Now ask me also, what I suffer; for I too am undone.\nORES. By whom? This would be an evil added to my evils.\nPYL. Strophius, my father, being enraged, hath driven me an exile from his house.\nORES. Bringing against thee some private charge, or one in common with the citizens?\nPYL. Because I perpetrated with thee the murder of thy mother, he banished me, calling me unholy.\nORES. O thou unfortunate! it seems that thou also sufferest for my evils.\nPYL. We have not Menelaus's manners—this must be borne.\nORES. Dost thou not fear lest Argos should wish to kill thee, as it does also me?\nPYL. We do not belong to these to punish, but to the land of the Phocians.\nORES. The populace is a terrible thing, when they have evil leaders.\nPYL. But when they have good ones, they always deliberate good things.\nORES. Be it so: we must speak on our common business.\nPYL. On what affair of necessity?\nORES. Supposing I should go to the citizens, and say—\nPYL. —that thou hast acted justly?\nORES. Ay, avenging my father:\nPYL. I fear they might not receive thee gladly.\nORES. But shall I die then shuddering in silence!\nPYL. This were cowardly.\nORES. How then can I do?\nPYL. Hast thou any chance of safety, if thou remainest?\nORES. I have none.\nPYL. But going, is there any hope of thy being preserved from thy miseries?\nORES. Should it chance well, there might be.\nPYL. Is not this then better than remaining?\nORES. Shall I go then?\nPYL. Dying thus, at least thou wilt die more honorably.\nORES. And I have a just cause.\nPYL. Only pray for its appearing so.\nORES. Thou sayest well: this way I avoid the imputation of cowardice.\nPYL. More than by tarrying here.\nORES. And some one perchance may pity me—\nPYL. Yes; for thy nobleness of birth is a great thing.\nORES. —indignant at my father's death.\nPYL. All this in prospect.\nORES. Go I must, for it is not manly to die ingloriously.\nPYL. These sentiments I praise.\nORES. Shall we then tell these things to my sister?\nPYL. No, by the Gods.\nORES. Why, there might be tears.\nPYL. This then is a great omen.\nORES. Clearly it is better to be silent.\nPYL. Thou art a gainer by delay.\nORES. This one thing only opposes me.\nPYL. What new thing again is this thou sayest?\nORES. I fear lest the goddesses should stop me with their torments.\nPYL. But I will take care of thee.\nORES. It is a difficult and dangerous task to touch a man thus disordered.\nPYL. Not for me to touch thee.\nORES. Take care how thou art partner of my madness.\nPYL. Let not this be thought of.\nORES. Wilt thou not then be timid to assist me?\nPYL. No, for timidity is a great evil to friends.\nORES. Go on now, the helm of my foot.\nPYL. Having a charge worthy of a friend.\nORES. And guide me to my father's tomb.\nPYL. To what end is this?\nORES. That I may supplicate him to save me.\nPYL. This at least is just.\nORES. But let me not see my mother's monument.\nPYL. For she was an enemy. But hasten, that the decree of the Argives condemn thee not before thou goest; leaning thy side, weary with disease, on mine: since I will conduct thee through the city, little caring for the multitude, nothing ashamed; for where shall I show myself thy friend, if I assist thee not when them art in perilous condition?\nORES. This it is to have companions, not relationship alone; so that a man who is congenial in manners, though a stranger in blood, is a better friend for a man to have, than ten thousand relatives.\nCHORUS.\nThe great happiness, and the valor high sounding throughout Greece, and by the channels of the Simois, has again withdrawn from the fortune of the Atridæ, as of old, from the ancient calamity of the house, when the strife of the golden lamb[20] arose among the descendants of Tantalus; most shocking feasts, and the slaughter of noble children; from whence murder responsive to murder fails not to attend on the two sons of Atreus. What seems good is not good, to gash the parents' skin with a fierce hand, and brandish the sword black-stained with blood in the sunbeams. But, on the other hand, to act wickedly[21] is mad impiety, and the folly of evil-minded men.\nBut the wretched daughter of Tyndarus in the fear of death shrieked out, 'My son, thou darest impious deeds, killing thy mother; do not, attending to the gratification of thy father, kindle an everlasting disgrace.'\nWhat malady, or what tears, or what pity on earth is greater, than to imbrue one's hand in a mother's blood? What a deed, what a deed having performed, does the son of Agamemnon rave with madness, a prey to the Eumenides, marked for death, giddy with his rolling eyes! O wretched on account of his mother, when though seeing the breast bared from the robe of golden texture, he stabbed the mother in retaliation for the father's sufferings.\nELECTRA, CHORUS.\nELEC. Ye virgins, has the wretched Orestes, overcome with heaven-inflicted madness, rushed any where from this house?\nCHOR. By no means; but he is gone to the Argive people, to undergo the trial proposed regarding life, by which you must either live or die.\nELEC. Alas me! what thing has he done? but who persuaded him?\nCHOR. Pylades.—But this messenger seems soon about to inform us of what has passed there concerning thy brother.\nMESSENGER, ELECTRA, CHORUS.\nMESS. O wretched hapless daughter of the chief Agamemnon, revered Electra, hear the unfortunate words which I am come to bring.\nELEC. Alas! alas! we are undone; this thou signifiest by thy speech. For thou comest, as it seems, a messenger of woes.\nMESS. It has been carried by the vote of the Pelasgians, that thy brother and thou must die this day.\nELEC. Ah me! the expected event has come, which long since fearing, I pined away with lamentations on account of what was in prospect.—But what was the debate? What arguments among the Argives condemned us, and confirmed our sentence of death? Tell me, old man, whether by the hand raised to stone me, or by the sword must I breathe out my soul, having this calamity in common with my brother?\nMESS. I chanced indeed to be entering the gates from the country, anxious to hear both what regarded thee, and what regarded Orestes; for at all times I had a favorable inclination toward thy father: and thy house fed me, poor indeed, but noble in my conduct toward friends. But I see the crowd going and sitting down on an eminence; where they say Danaus first collected the people to a common council, when he suffered punishment at the hands of Ægyptus. But seeing this concourse, I asked one of the citizens, 'What new thing is stirring in Argos? Has any message from hostile powers roused the city of the Danaids?' But he said, 'Seest thou not this Orestes walking near us, who is about to run in the contest of life and death?' But I see an unexpected sight, which oh that I had never seen! Pylades and thy brother walking together, the one indeed broken with sickness, but the other, like a brother, sympathizing with his friend, tending his weakened state with fostering care. But when the assembly of the Argives was full, a herald stood forth and said, 'Who wishes to speak on the question, whether it is right that Orestes, who has killed his mother, should die, or not?' And on this Talthybius rises, who, in conjunction with thy father, laid waste the Phrygians. But he spoke words of divided import, being the constant slave of those in power; struck with admiration indeed at thy father, but not commending thy brother (speciously mixing up words of bad import), because he laid down no good laws toward his parents: but he was continually casting a smiling glance on Ægisthus's friends. For such is this kind; heralds always dance attendance on the prosperous; but that man is their friend, whoever may chance to have power in the state, and to be in office. But next to him prince Diomed harangued; he indeed was for suffering them to kill neither thee nor thy brother, but bid them observe piety by punishing you with banishment. But some indeed murmured their assent, that he spoke well, but others praised him not.[22] And after him rises up some man, intemperate in speech, powerful in boldness, an Argive, yet not an Argive,[23] forced upon us, relying both on the tumult, and on ignorant boldness, prompt by persuasion to involve them in some mischief. (For when a man, sweet in words, holding bad sentiments, persuades the multitude, it is a great evil to the city. But as many as always advise good things with understanding, although not at the present moment, eventually are of service to the state: but the intelligent leader ought to look to this, for the case is the same with the man who speaks words, and the man who approves them.) Who said, that they ought to kill Orestes and thee by stoning. But Tyndarus was privily making up such sort of speeches for him who wished your death to speak. But another man stood up, and spoke in opposition to him, in form indeed not made to catch the eye; but a man endued with the qualities of a man, rarely polluting the city, and the circle of the forum; one who farmed his own land,[24] which class of persons[25] alone preserve the country, but prudent, and wishing the tenor of his conduct to be in unison with his words, uncorrupted, one that had conformed to a blameless mode of living; he proposed to crown Orestes the son of Agamemnon,[25a] who was willing to avenge his father by slaying a wicked and unholy woman, who took this out of the power of men, and would no one have been the cause of arming the hand for war, nor undertaking an expedition, leaving his home, if those who are left destroy what is intrusted to their charge in the house, disgracing their husbands' beds. And to right-minded men at least he appeared to speak well: and none spoke besides, but thy brother advanced and said, 'O inhabitants of the land of Inachus, avenging you no less than my father, I slew my mother, for if the murder of men shall become licensed to women, ye no longer can escape dying, or ye must be slaves to your wives. But ye do the contrary to what ye ought to do. For now she that was false to the bed of my father is dead; but if ye do indeed slay me, the law has lost its force, and no man can escape dying, forasmuch as there will be no lack of this audacity.'\nBut he persuaded not the people, though appearing to speak well. But that villain, who spoke among the multitude, overcomes him, he that harangued for the killing of thy brother and thee. But scarcely did the wretched Orestes persuade them that he might not die by stoning; but he promised that this day he would quit his life by self-slaughter together with thee:—but Pylades is conducting him from the council, weeping: but his friends accompany him bewailing him, pitying him; but he is coming a sad spectacle to thee, and a wretched sight. But prepare the sword, or the noose for thy neck, for thou must die, but thy nobleness of birth hath profited thee nothing, nor the Pythian Phœbus who sits on the tripod, but hath destroyed thee.\nCHOR. O unhappy virgin! how art thou dumb, casting thy muffled countenance toward the ground, as though about to run into a strain of groans and lamentations!\nELEC. I begin the lament, O land of Greece, digging my white nail into my cheek, sad bleeding woe, and dashing my head, which[26] the lovely[27] goddess of the manes beneath the earth has to her share. And let the Cyclopian land[28] howl, applying the steel to their head cropped of hair over the calamity of our house. This pity, this pity, proceeds for those who are about to die, who once were the princes of Greece. For it is gone, it is gone, the entire race of the children of Pelops has perished, and the happiness which once resided in these blest abodes. Envy from heaven has now seized it, and the harsh decree of blood in the state. Alas! alas! O race of mortals that endure for a day, full of tears, full of troubles, behold how contrary to expectation fate comes. But in the long lapse of time each different man receives by turns his different sufferings.[29] But the whole race of mortals is unstable and uncertain.\nOh! could I go to that rock stretched from Olympus in its loftiness midst heaven and earth by golden chains, that mass of clay borne round with rapid revolutions, that in my plaints I might cry out to my ancient father Tantalus; who begat the progenitors of my family, who saw calamities, what time in the pursuing of steeds, Pelops in his car drawn by four horses perpetrated, as he drove, the murder of Myrtilus, by casting him into the sea, hurling him down to the surge of the ocean, as he guided his car on the shore of the briny sea by Geræstus foaming with its white billows. Whence the baleful curse came on my house since, by the agency of Maia's son,[30] there appeared the pernicious, pernicious prodigy of the golden-fleeced lamb, a birth which took place among the flocks of the warlike Atreus. On which both Discord drove back the winged chariot of the sun, directing it from the path of heaven leading to the west toward Aurora borne on her single horse.[31] And Jupiter drove back the course of the seven moving Pleiads another way: and from that period[32] he sends deaths in succession to deaths, and 'the feast of Thyestes,' so named from Thyestes. And the bed of the Cretan Ærope deceitful in a deceitful marriage has come as a finishing stroke on me and my father, to the miserable destruction of our family.\nCHOR. But see, thy brother is advancing, condemned by the vote of death, and Pylades the most faithful of all, a man like a brother, supporting the enfeebled limbs of Orestes, walking by his side[33] with the foot of tender solicitude.\nELECTRA, ORESTES, PYLADES, CHORUS.\nELEC. Alas me! for I bewail thee, my brother, seeing thee before the tomb, and before the pyre of thy departed shade: alas me! again and again, how am I bereft of my senses, seeing with my eyes the very last sight of thee.\nORES. Wilt thou not in silence, ceasing from womanish groans, make up thy mind to what is decreed? These things indeed are lamentable, but yet we must bear our present fate.\nELEC. And how can I be silent? We wretched no longer are permitted to view this light of the God.\nORES. Do not thou kill me; I, the unhappy, have died enough already under the hands of the Argives; but pass over our present ills.\nELEC. O Orestes! oh wretched in thy youth, and thy fate, and thy untimely death, then oughtest thou to live, when thou art no more.\nORES. Do not by the Gods throw cowardice around me, bringing the remembrance of my woes so as to cause tears.\nELEC. We shall die; it is not possible not to groan our misfortunes; for the dear life is a cause of pity to all mortals.\nORES. This is the day appointed for us! but we must either fit the suspended noose, or whet the sword with our hand.\nELEC. Do thou then kill me, my brother; let none of the Argives kill me, putting a contumely on the offspring of Agamemnon.\nORES. I have enough of thy mother's blood, but thee I will not slay; but die by thine own hand in whatever manner thou wilt.\nELEC. These things shall be; I will not be deserted by thy sword;[34] but I wish to clasp my hands around thy neck.\nORES. Thou enjoyest a vain gratification, if this be an enjoyment, to throw thy hands around those who are hard at death's door.\nELEC. Oh thou most dear! oh thou that hast the desirable and most sweet name, and one soul with thy sister!\nORES. Thou wilt melt me; and still I wish to answer thee in the endearment of encircling arms, for why am I any longer ashamed? O bosom of my sister, O dear object of my caresses, these embraces are allowed to us miserable beings instead of children and the bridal bed.\nELEC. Alas! How can the same sword (if this request be lawful) kill us, and one tomb wrought of cedar receive us?\nORES. This would be most sweet; but thou seest how destitute we are, in respect to being able to share our sepulture.\nELEC. Did not Menelaus speak in behalf of thee, taking a decided part against thy death, the base man, the deserter of my father? [Note [G].]\nORES. He showed it not even in his countenance, but keeping his hopes on the sceptre, he was cautious how he saved his friends. But let be, he will die acting in a manner nobly, and most worthily of Agamemnon. And I indeed will show my high descent to the city, striking home to my heart with the sword; but thee, on the other hand, it behooveth to act in concert with my bold attempts. But do thou, Pylades, be the umpire of our death, and well compose the bodies of us when dead, and bury us together, bearing us to our father's tomb. And farewell—but I am going to the deed, as thou seest.\nPYL. Hold. This one thing indeed first I bring in charge against thee—Dost thou think that I can wish to live when thou diest?[35]\nORES. For how does it concern thee to die with me?\nPYL. Dost ask? But how does it to live without thy company?\nORES. Thou didst not slay my mother, as I did, a wretch.\nPYL. With thee I did at least; I ought also to suffer these things in common with thee.\nORES. Take thyself back to thy father, do not die with me. For thou indeed hast a city (but I no longer have), and the mansion of thy father, and a great harbor of wealth. But thou art frustrated in thy marriage with this unhappy virgin, whom I betrothed to thee, revering thy friendship. Nevertheless do thou, contracting other nuptials, be a blest father, but the connection between me and thee no longer subsists, But thou, O darling name of my converse, farewell, be happy, for this is not allowed me, but it is to thee; for we, the dead, are deprived of happiness.\nPYL. Surely thou art wide astray from my purposes. Nor may the fruitful plain receive my blood, nor the bright air, if ever I betraying thee, having freed myself, forsake thee; for I committed the slaughter with thee (I will not deny it), and I planned all things, for which now thou sufferest vengeance. Die then I must with thee and her together, for her, whose marriage I have courted, I consider as my wife; for what good excuse ever shall I give, going to the Delphian land to the citadel of the Phocians, I, who was present with you, your friend, before indeed you were unfortunate, but now, when you are unfortunate, am no longer thy friend? It is not possible —but these things are my care also. But since we are about to die, let us come to a common conference, how Menelaus may be involved in our calamity.\nORES. O thou dearest man: for would I see this and die.\nPYL. Be persuaded then, but defer the slaughtering sword.\nORES. I will defer, if any how I can avenge myself on my enemy.\nPYL. Be silent then, for I have but small confidence in women.\nORES. Do not at all fear these, for they are friends that are present.\nPYL. Let us kill Helen, which will cause great grief to Menelaus.\nORES. How? for the will is here, if it can be done with glory.\nPYL. Stabbing her; but she is lurking in thy house.\nORES. Yes indeed, and is putting her seal on all my effects.\nPYL. But she shall seal no more, having Pluto for her bridegroom.\nORES. And how can this be? for she has a train of barbarian attendants.\nPYL. Whom? for I would be afraid of no Phrygian.\nORES. Such men as should preside over mirrors and scents.\nPYL. For has she brought hither her Trojan fineries?\nORES. Oh yes! so that Greece is but a cottage for her.\nPYL. A race of slaves is a mere nothing against a race that will not be slaves.\nORES. In good truth, this if I could achieve, I shrink not from two deaths.\nPYL. But neither do I indeed, if I could revenge thee at least.\nORES. Disclose thy purpose, and go through it as thou sayest.\nPYL. We will enter then the house, as men about to die.\nORES. Thus far I comprehend, but the rest I do not comprehend.\nPYL. We will make our lamentation to her of the things we suffer.\nORES. So that she shall weep, though joyed within her heart.\nPYL. And the same things will be for us to do afterward, which she does then.\nORES. Then how shall we finish the contest?\nPYL. We will wear our swords concealed beneath our robes.\nORES. But what slaughter can there be before her attendants?\nPYL. We will bolt them out, scattered in different parts of the house.\nORES. And him that is not silent we must kill.\nPYL. Then the circumstances of the moment will point out what steps to take.\nORES. To kill Helen, I understand the sign.\nPYL. Thou seest: but hear on what honorable principles I meditate it. For, if we draw our sword on a more modest woman, the murder will blot our names with infamy. But in the present instance, she shall suffer vengeance for the whole of Greece, whose fathers she slew, and made the brides bereaved of their spouses; there shall be a shout, and they will kindle up fire to the Gods, praying for many blessings to fall to thee and me, inasmuch as we shed the blood of a wicked woman. But thou shalt not be called the matricide, when thou hast slain her, but dropping this name thou shalt arrive at better things, being styled the slayer of the havoc-dealing Helen. It never, never were right that Menelaus should be prosperous, and that thy father, and thou, and thy sister should die, and thy mother; (this I forbear, for it is not decorous to mention;) and that he should seize thy house, having recovered his bride by the means of Agamemnon's valor. For may I live no longer, if I draw not my black sword upon her. But if then we do not compass the murder of Helen, having fired the palace we will die, for we shall have glory, succeeding in one of these two things, nobly dying, or nobly rescued.\nCHOR. The daughter of Tyndarus is an object of detestation to all women, being one that has given rise to scandal against the sex.\nORES. Alas! There is no better thing than a real friend, not riches, not kingdoms; but the popular applause becomes a thing of no account to receive in exchange for a generous friend. For thou contrivedst the destruction that befell Ægisthus, and wast close to me in my dangers. But now again thou givest me to revenge me on mine enemies, and art not out of the way—but I will leave off praising thee, since there is some burden even in this 'to be praised to excess.' But I altogether in a state of death, wish to do something to my foes and die, that I may in turn destroy those who betrayed me, and those may groan who also made me unhappy. I am the son of Agamemnon, who ruled over Greece by general consent; no tyrant, but yet he had the power as it were of a God, whom I will not disgrace, suffering a slavish death, but breathe out my soul in freedom, but on Menelaus will I revenge me. For if we could gain this one thing, we should be prosperous, if from any chance safety should come unhoped for on the slayers then, not the slain: this I pray for. For what I wish is sweet to delight the mind without fear of cost, though with but fleeting words uttered through the mouth.\nELEC. I, O brother, think that this very thing brings safety to thee, and thy friend, and in the third place to me.\nORES. Thou meanest the providence of the Gods: but where is this? for I know that there is understanding in thy mind.\nELEC. Hear me then, and thou too give thy attention.\nORES. Speak, since the existing prospect of good affords some pleasure.\nELEC. Art thou acquainted with the daughter of Helen? Thou knowest her of whom I ask.\nORES. I know her, Hermione, whom my mother brought up.\nELEC. She is gone to Clytæmnestra's tomb.\nORES. For what purpose? what hope dost thou suggest?\nELEC. To pour libations on the tomb in behalf of her mother.\nORES. And what is this, thou hast told me of, that regards our safety?\nELEC. Seize her as a pledge as she is coming back.\nORES. What remedy for the three friends is this thou sayest?\nELEC. When Helen is dead, if Menelaus does any harm to thee or Pylades, or me (for this firm of friendship is all one), say that thou wilt kill Hermione; but thou oughtest to draw thy sword, and hold it to the neck of the virgin. And if indeed Menelaus save thee, anxious that the virgin may not die; when he sees Helen's corse weltering in blood, give back the virgin for her father to enjoy; but should he, not governing his angry temper, slay thee, do thou also plunge the sword into the virgin's neck, and I think that he, though at first he come to us very big, will after a season soften his heart; for neither is he brave nor valiant: this is the fortress of our safety that I have; my arguments on the subject have been spoken.\nORES. O thou that hast indeed the mind of a man, but a form among women beautiful, to what a degree art thou more worthy of life than death! Pylades, wilt thou miserably be disappointed of such a woman, or dwelling with her obtain this happy marriage?\nPYL. For would it could be so! and she could come to the city of the Phocians meeting with her deserts in splendid nuptials!\nORES. But when will Hermione come to the house? Since for the rest thou saidst most admirably, if we could succeed in taking the whelp of the impious father.\nELEC. Even now I guess that she must be near the house, for with this supposition the space itself of the time coincides.\nORES. It is well; do thou therefore, my sister Electra, waiting before the house, meet the arrival of the virgin. And watch, lest any one, either some ally, or the brother of my father, should be beforehand with us coming to the palace: and make some noise toward the house, either knocking at the doors, or sending thy voice within. But let us, O Pylades (for thou undertakest this labor with me), entering in, arm our hands with the sword to one last attempt. O my father, that inhabitest the realms of gloomy night, Orestes thy son invokes thee to come a succor to thy suppliants; for on thy account I wretched suffer unjustly, and am betrayed by thy brother, myself having acted justly: whose wife I wish to take and destroy; but be thou our accomplice in this affair.\nELEC. O father, come then, if beneath the earth thou hearest thy children calling, who die for thee.\nPYL. O thou relation[36] of my father, give ear, O Agamemnon, to my prayers also, preserve thy children.\nORES. I slew my mother.\nPYL. But I directed the sword.\nELEC. But I at least incited you, and freed you from delay.\nORES. Succoring thee, my father.\nELEC. Neither did I forsake thee.\nPYL. Wilt thou not therefore, hearing these things that are brought against thee,[37] defend thy children?\nORES. I pour libations on thee with my tears.\nELEC. And I with lamentations.\nPYL. Cease, and let us haste forth to the work, for if prayers penetrate under the earth, he hears; but, O Jove our ancestor, and thou revered deity of justice, grant us to succeed, him, and myself, and this virgin, for over us three friends one hazard, one cause impends, either for all to live, or all to die!\nELECTRA, CHORUS.\nELEC. O dear Mycenian virgins, who have the first place at the Pelasgian seat of the Argives;—\nCHOR. What voice art thou uttering, my respected mistress? for this appellation awaits thee in the city of the Danaids.\nELEC. Arrange yourselves, some of you in this beaten way, and some there, in that other path, to guard the house.\nCHOR. But on what account dost thou command this, tell me, my friend.\nELEC. Fear possesses me, lest any one being in the palace, on account of this murderous deed, should contrive evils on evils.\nSEMICHOR. Go, let us hasten, I indeed will guard this path, that tends toward where the sun flings his first rays.\nSEMICHOR. And I indeed this, which leads toward the west.\nELEC. Now turn the glances of your eyes around in every position, now here, now there, then take some other view.\nCHOR. We are, as thou commandest.\nELEC. Now roll your eyelids over your pupils, glance them every way through your ringlets.\nSEMICHOR. Is this any one here appearing in the path?—Who is this rustic that is standing about thy palace?\nELEC. We are undone then, my friends; he will immediately show to the enemy the lurking beasts of prey armed with their swords.\nSEMICHOR. Be not afraid, the path is clear, which thou thinkest not.\nELEC. But what?—does all with you remain secure? Give me some good report, whether the space before the hall be empty?\nSEMICHOR. All here at least is well, but look to thy province, for no one of the Danaids is approaching toward us.\nSEMICHOR. Thy report agrees with mine, for neither is there a disturbance here.\nELEC. Come now,—I will listen at the door: why do ye delay, ye that are within, to sacrifice the victim, now that ye are in quiet?—They hear not: Alas me! wretched in misery! Are the swords then struck dumb at her beauty? Perhaps some Argive in arms rushing in with the foot of succor will approach the palace.—Now watch more carefully; it is no contest that admits delay; but turn your eyes some this way, and some that.\nCHOR. I turn each different way, looking about on all sides.\nHELEN. (within) Oh! Pelasgian Argos! I am miserably slain!\nELEC. Heard ye? The men are employing their head in the murder.—It is the shriek of Helen, as I may conjecture.\nSEMICHOR. O eternal might of Jove, come to assist my friends in every way.\nHEL. Menelaus, I die! But thou art at hand, and dost not help me!\nELEC. Kill, strike, slay, plunging with your hands the two double-edged swords into the deserter of her father, the deserter of her husband, who destroyed numbers of the Grecians perishing by the spear at the river, whence tears fell into conjunction with tears, fell on account of the iron weapons around the whirlpools of Scamander.\nCHOR. Be still, be still: I heard the sound of some one coming along the path around the palace.\nELEC. O most dear women, in the midst of the slaughter behold Hermione is present; let us cease from our clamor, for she comes about to fall into the meshes of our toils. A goodly prey will she be, if she be taken. Again to your stations with a calm countenance, and with a color that shall not give evidence of what has been done. I too will preserve a pensive cast of countenance, as though perfectly unacquainted with what has happened.\nHERMIONE, ELECTRA, CHORUS.\nELEC. O virgin, art thou come from crowning Clytæmnestra's tomb, and pouring libations to her manes?\nHERM. I am come, having obtained her good services; but some terror has come upon me, on account of the noise in the palace, which I hear being a far distance off the house.\nELEC. But why? There have happened to us things worthy of groans.\nHERM. Speak good words; but what news dost thou tell me?\nELEC. It has been decreed by this land, that Orestes and I die.\nHERM. No, I hope not so; you, who are my relations.\nELEC. It is fixed; but we stand under the yoke of necessity.\nHERM. Was the noise then in the house on this account?\nELEC. For falling down a suppliant at the knees of Helen, he cries out—\nHERM. Who? for I know no more, except thou tellest me.\nELEC. The wretched Orestes, that he may not die, and in behalf of me.\nHERM. For a just reason then the house lamented.\nELEC. For on what other account should one rather cry out? But come, and join in supplication with thy friends, falling down before thy mother, the supremely blest, that Menelaus will not see us perish. But, O thou, that receivedst thy education at the hands of my mother, pity us, and alleviate our sufferings. Come hither to the trial; but I will lead the way, for thou alone hast the ends of our preservation.\nHERM. Behold I direct my footstep toward the house. Be preserved, as far as lies in me.\nELEC. O ye in the house, my dear warriors, will ye not take your prey?\nHERM. Alas me! who are these I see?\nORES. (advancing) Thou must be silent; for thou art come to preserve us, not thyself.\nELEC. Hold her, hold her; and pointing a sword to her neck be silent, that Menelaus may know, that having found men, not Phrygian cowards, he has treated them in a manner he should treat cowards. What ho! what ho! my friends, make a noise, a noise, and shout before the palace, that the murder that is perpetrated spread not a dread alarm among the Argives, so that they run to assist to the king's palace, before I plainly see the slaughtered Helen lying weltering in her blood within the house, or else we hear the report from some of her attendants. For part of the havoc I know, and part not accurately.\nCHOR. With justice came the vengeance of the Gods on Helen. For she filled the whole of Greece with tears on account of the ruthless, ruthless Idean Paris, who brought the Grecian state to Ilium. But be silent, for the bolts of the royal mansion resound, for some one of the Phrygians comes forth, from whom we shall hear of the affairs within the house, in what state they are.\nPHRYGIAN, CHORUS.\nPHRY. I have escaped from death by the Argive sword in these barbaric slippers, climbing over the cedar beams of the bed and the Doric triglyphs, by the flight of a barbarian.[38] Thou art gone, thou art gone, O my country, my country! Alas me! whither can I escape, O strangers, flying through the hoary air, or the sea, which the Ocean, with head in shape like a bull's, rolling with his arms encircles the earth?\nCHOR. But what is the matter, O attendant of Helen, thou man of Ida?\nPHRY. O Ilion, Ilion! alas me! O thou fertile Phrygian city, thou sacred mount of Ida, how do I lament for thee destroyed, a sad,[39] sad strain for my barbaric voice, on account of that form of the hapless, hapless Helen, born from a bird, the offspring of the beauteous Leda in shape of a swan, the fiend of the splendid Apollonian Pergamus! Alas! Oh! lamentations! lamentations! O wretched Dardania, warlike school[40] of Ganymede, the companion of Jove!\nCHOR. Relate to us clearly each circumstance that happened in the house, for I do not understand your former account, but merely conjecture.\nPHRY. Αιλινον, αιλινον, the Barbarians begin the song of death in the language of Asia, Alas! alas! when the blood of kings has been poured on the earth by the ruthless swords of death. There came to the palace (that I may relate each circumstance) two Grecians, lions, of the one the leader of the Grecian host was said to be the father, the other the son of Strophius, a man of dark design; such was Ulysses, secretly treacherous, but faithful to his friends, bold in battle, skilled in war, cruel as the dragon. May he perish for his deep concealed design, the worker of evil! But they having advanced within her chamber, whom the archer Paris had as his wife, their eyes bathed with tears, they sat down in humble mien, one on each side of her, on the right and on the left, armed with swords. And around her knees did they both fling their suppliant hands, around the knees of Helen did they fling them. But the Phrygian attendants sprung up, and fled in amazement: and one called out to another in terror, See, lest there be treachery. To some indeed there appeared no danger; but to others the dragon stained with his mother's blood appeared bent to infold in his closest toils the daughter of Tyndarus.\nCHOR. But where wert thou then, or hadst thou long before fled through fear?\nPHRY. After the Phrygian fashion I chanced with the close circle of feathers to be fanning the gale, that sported in the ringlets of Helen, before her cheek, after the barbaric fashion. But she was winding with her fingers the flax round the distaff, but what she had spun she let fall on the ground, desirous of making from the Phrygian spoils a robe of purple as an ornament for the tomb, a gift to Clytæmnestra. But Orestes entreated the Spartan girl; 'O daughter of Jove, here, place thy footstep on the ground, rising from thy seat, come to the place of our ancestor Pelops, the ancient altar, that thou mayest hear my words.' And he leads her, but she followed, not dreaming of what was about to happen. But his accomplice, the wicked Phocian, attended to other points. 'Will ye not depart from out of the way, but are the Phrygians always vile?' and he bolted us out scattered in different parts of the house, some in the stables of the horses, and some in the outhouses, and some here and there, dispersing them some one way, some another, afar from their mistress.\nCHOR. What calamity took place after this?\nPHRY. O powerful, powerful Idean mother, alas! alas! the murderous sufferings, and the lawless evils, which I saw, I saw in the royal palace! From beneath their purple robes concealed having their drawn swords in their hands, they turned each his eye on either side, lest any one might chance to be present. But like mountain boars standing over against the lady, they say, 'Thou shalt die, thou shalt die! thy vile husband kills thee, having given up the offspring of his brother to die at Argos.' But she shrieked out, Ah me! ah me! and throwing her white arm on her breast inflicted on her head miserable blows, and, her feet turned to flight, she stepped, she stepped with her golden sandals; but Orestes thrusting his fingers into her hair, outstripping her flight,[41] bending back her neck over his left shoulder, was about to plunge the black sword into her throat.\nCHOR. Where then were the Phrygians, who dwell under the same roof, to assist her?\nPHRY. With a clamor having burst by means of bars the doors and cells where we were waiting, we run to her assistance, each to different parts of the house, one bringing stones, another spears, another having a long-handled sword in his hand. But Pylades came against us, impetuous, like as the Phrygian Hector or Ajax in his triple-crested helmet, whom I saw, I saw at the gates of Priam: but we clashed together the points of our swords: then indeed, then did the Phrygians give clear proof how inferior we were in the force of Mars to the spear of Greece. One indeed turning away, a fugitive, but another wounded, and another deprecating the death that threatened him: but under favor of the darkness we fled: and the corses fell, but some staggered, and some lay prostrate. But the wretched Hermione came to the house at the time when her murdered mother fell to the ground, that unhappy woman that gave her birth. And running upon her as Bacchanals without their thyrsus, as a heifer in the mountains they bore her away in their hands, and again eagerly rushed upon the daughter of Jove to slay her. But she vanished altogether from the chamber through the palace. O Jupiter and O earth, and light, and darkness! or by her enchantments, or by the art of magic, or by the stealth of the Gods. But of what followed I know no farther, for I sped in stealth my foot from the palace. But Menelaus having endured many, many severe toils, has received back from Troy the violated rites of Helen to no purpose.\nCHOR. And see something strange succeeds to these strange things, for I see Orestes with his sword drawn walking before the palace with agitated step,\nORESTES, PHRYGIAN, CHORUS.\nORES. Where is he that fled from my sword out of the palace?\nPHRY. I supplicate thee, O king, falling prostrate before thee after the barbaric fashion.\nORES. The case before us is not in Ilium, but the Argive land.\nPHRY. In every region to live is sweeter than to die, in the opinion of the wise.\nORES. Didst thou not raise a cry for Menelaus to come with succor?\nPHRY. I indeed am present on purpose to assist thee; for thou art the more worthy.\nORES. Perished then the daughter of Tyndarus justly?\nPHRY. Most justly, even had she three lives for vengeance.\nORES. With thy tongue dost thou flatter, not having these sentiments within?\nPHRY. For ought she not? She who utterly destroyed Greece as well as the Phrygians themselves?\nORES. Swear, I will kill thee else, that thou art not speaking to curry favor with me.\nPHRY. By my life have I sworn, which I should wish to hold a sacred oath.\nORES. Was the steel thus dreadful to all the Phrygians at Troy also?\nPHRY. Remove thy sword, for being so near me it gleams horrid slaughter.\nORES. Art thou afraid, lest thou shouldest become a rock, as though looking on the Gorgon?\nPHRY. Lest I should become a corse, but I know not of the Gorgon's head.\nORES. Slave as thou art, dost thou fear death, which will rid thee from thy woes?\nPHRY. Every one, although a man be a slave, rejoices to behold the light.\nORES. Thou sayest well; thy understanding; saves thee, but go into the house.\nPHRY. Thou wilt not kill me then?\nORES. Thou art pardoned.\nPHRY. This is good word thou hast spoken.\nORES. Yet we may change our measures.\nPHRY. But this thou sayest not well.\nORES. Thou art a fool, if thou thinkest I could endure to defile me by smiting thy neck, for neither art thou a woman, nor oughtest thou to be ranked among men. But that thou mightest not raise a clamor came I forth out of the house: for Argos, when it has heard a noise, is soon roused, but we have no dread in meeting Menelaus, as far as swords go; but let him come exulting with his golden ringlets flowing over his shoulders, for if he collects the Argives, and brings them against the palace seeking revenge for the death of Helen, and is not willing to let me be in safety, and my sister, and Pylades my accomplice in this affair, he shall see two corses, both the virgin and his wife.\nCHORUS.\nAlas! alas! O fate, the house of the Atridæ again falls into another, another fearful struggle.\nSEMICHOR. What shall we do? shall we carry these tidings to the city, or shall we keep in silence?\nSEMICHOR. This is the safer plan, my friends.\nSEMICHOR. Behold before the house, behold this smoke leaping aloft in the air portends something.\nSEMICHOR. They are lighting the torches, as about to burn down the mansion of Tantalus, nor do they forbear from murder.\nCHOR. The God rules the events that happen to mortals, whichsoever way he wills. But some vast power by the instigation of the Furies has struck, has struck these palaces to the shedding of blood on account of the fall of Myrtilus from the chariot.\nBut lo! I see Menelaus also here approaching the house with a quick step, having by some means or other perceived the calamity which now is present. Will ye not anticipate him by closing the gates with bolts, O ye children of Atreus, who are in the palace? A man in prosperity is a terrible thing to those in adversity, as now them art in misery, Orestes.\nMENELAUS below, ORESTES, PYLADES, ELECTRA, HERMIONE above, CHORUS.\nMEN. I am present, having heard the horrid and atrocious deeds of the two lions, for I call them not men. For I have now heard of my wife, that she died not, but vanished away, this that I heard was empty report, which one deceived by fright related; but these are the artifices of the matricide, and much derision. Open some one the door, my attendants I command to burst open these gates here, that my child at least we may deliver from the hand of these blood-polluted men, and may receive my unhappy, my miserable lady, with whom those murderers of my wife must die by my hand.\nORES. What ho there! Touch not these gates with thine hands: to Menelaus I speak, that thou towerest in thy boldness, or with this pinnacle will I crush thy head, having rent down the ancient battlement, the labor of the builders. But the gates are made fast with bolts, which will hinder thee from thy purpose of bringing aid, so that thou canst not pass within the palace.\nMEN. Ha! what is this? I see the blaze of torches, and these stationed on the battlements, on the height of the palace, and the sword placed over the neck of my daughter to guard her.\nORES. Whether is it thy will to question, or to hear me?\nMEN. I wish neither, but it is necessary, as it seems, to hear thee.\nORES. I am about to slay thy daughter if thou wish to know.\nMEN. Having slain Helen, dost thou perpetrate murder on murder?\nORES. For would I had gained my purpose not being deluded, as I was, by the Gods.\nMEN. Thou hast slain her, and deniest it, and speakest these things to insult me.\nORES. It is a denial that gives me pain, for would that—\nMEN. Thou had done what deed? for thou callest forth alarm.\nORES. I had hurled to hell the fury of Greece.\nMEN. Give back the body of my wife, that I may bury her in a tomb.\nORES. Ask her of the Gods; but I will slay thy daughter.\nMEN. The matricide contrives murder on murder.\nORES. The avenger of his father, whom thou gavest up to die.\nMEN. Was not the blood of thy mother formerly shed sufficient for thee?\nORES. I should not be weary of slaying wicked women, were I to slay them forever.\nMEN. Art thou also, Pylades, a partaker in this murder?\nORES. By his silence he assents, but if I speak, it will be sufficient.\nMEN. But not with impunity, unless indeed thou fliest on wings.\nORES. We will not fly, but will set fire to the palace?\nMEN. What! wilt thou destroy thy father's mansion?\nORES. Yes, that thou mayest not possess it, will I, having stabbed this virgin here over the flames.\nMEN. Slay her; since having slain thou shalt at least give me satisfaction for these deeds.\nORES. It shall be so then.\nMEN. Alas! on no account do this!\nORES. Be silent then; but bear to suffer evil justly.\nMEN. What! is it just for thee to live?\nORES. Yes, and to rule over the land.\nMEN. What land!\nORES. Here, in Pelasgian Argos.\nMEN. Well wouldst thou touch the sacred lavers!\nORES. And pray why not?\nMEN. And wouldst slaughter the victim before the battle!\nORES. And thou wouldst most righteously.\nMEN. Yes, for I am pure as to my hands.\nORES. But not thy heart.\nMEN. Who would speak to thee?\nORES. Whoever loves his father.\nMEN. And whoever reveres his mother.\nORES. —Is happy.\nMEN. Not thou at least.\nORES. For wicked women please me not.\nMEN. Take away the sword from my daughter.\nORES. Thou art false in thy expectations.\nMEN. But wilt thou kill my daughter?\nORES. Thou art no longer false.\nMEN. Alas me! what shall I do?\nORES. Go to the Argives, and persuade them.\nMEN. With what persuasion?\nORES. Beseech the city that we may not die.[41a]\nMEN. Otherwise ye will slay my daughter?\nORES. The thing is so.\nMEN. O wretched Helen!—\nORES. And am I not wretched?\nMEN. I brought thee hither from the Trojans to be a victim.\nORES. For would this were so!\nMEN. Having endured ten thousand toils.\nORES. Except on my account.\nMEN. I have met with dreadful treatment.\nORES. For then, when thou oughtest, thou wert of no assistance.\nMEN. Thou hast me.\nORES. Thou at least hast caught thyself. But, ho there! set fire to the palace, Electra, from beneath: and thou, Pylades, the most true of my friends, light up these battlements of the walls.\nMEN. O land of the Danai, and inhabitants of warlike Argos, will ye not, ho there! come in arms to my succor? For this man here, having perpetrated the shocking murder of his mother, brings destruction on your whole city, that he may live.\nAPOLLO.\nMenelaus, cease from thy irritated state of mind; I Phœbus the son of Latona, in thy presence, am addressing thee. Thou too, Orestes, who standest over that damsel with thy sword drawn, that thou mayest know what commands I bring with me. Helen indeed, whom thou minded to destroy, working Menelaus to anger, didst fail of thy purpose, she is here, whom ye see wrapt in the bosom of the sky, preserved, and not slain by thy hands. Her I preserved, and snatched from thy sword, commanded by my father Jove. For being the daughter of Jove, it is right that she should live immortal. And she shall have her seat by Castor and Pollux in the bosom of the sky, the guardian of mariners. But take to thyself another bride, and lead her home, since for the beauty of this woman the Gods brought together the Greeks and Trojans, and caused deaths, that they might draw from off the earth the pride of mortals, who had become an infinite multitude. Thus is it with regard to Helen; but thee, on the other hand, Orestes, it behooveth, having passed beyond the boundaries of this land, to inhabit the Parrhasian plain during the revolution of a year, and it shall be called by a name after thy flight, so that the Azanes and Arcadians shall call it Oresteum: and thence having departed to the city of the Athenians, undergo the charge of shedding thy mother's blood laid by the three Furies. But the Gods the arbiters of the cause shall pass on thee most sacredly their decree on the hill of Mars, in which it behooveth thee to be victorious. But Hermione, to whose neck thou art holding the sword, it is destined for thee, Orestes, to wed, but Neoptolemus, who thinks to marry her, shall never marry her. For it is fated to him to die by the Delphic sword, as he is demanding of me satisfaction for his father Achilles. But to Pylades give thy sister's hand, as thou didst formerly agree, but a happy life now coming on awaits him. But, O Menelaus, suffer Orestes to reign over Argos. But depart and rule over the Spartan land, having it as thy wife's dowry, who exposing thee to numberless evils always was bringing thee to this. But what regards the city I will make all right for him, I, who compelled him to slay his mother.\nORES. O Loxian prophet, thou wert not then a false prophet in thine oracles, but a true one. And yet a fear comes upon me, that having heard one of the Furies, I might think that I have been hearing thy voice. But it is well fulfilled, and I will obey thy words. Behold I let go Hermione from slaughter, and approve her alliance, whenever her father shall give her.\nMEN. O Helen, daughter of Jove, hail! but I bless thee inhabiting the happy mansions of the Gods. But to thee, Orestes, do I betroth my daughter at Phœbus's commands, but illustrious thyself marrying from an illustrious family, be happy, both thou and I who give her.\nAPOL. Now depart each of you whither we have appointed, and dissolve your quarrels.\nMEN. It is our duty to obey.\nORES. I too entertain the same sentiments, and I receive with friendship thee in thy sufferings, O Menelaus, and thy oracles, O Apollo.\nAPOL. Go now, each his own way, honoring the most excellent goddess Peace; but I will convey Helen to the mansions of Jove, passing through the pole of the shining stars, where sitting by Juno, and Hercules's Hebe, a goddess, she shall ever be honored by mortals with libations, in conjunction with the Tyndaridæ, the sons of Jove, presiding over the sea to the benefit of mariners.\nCHOR. O greatly glorious Victory, mayest thou uphold my life, and cease not from crowning me!",

His mother Jocasta made him come into the city, under sanction of a truce, and first confer with his brother respecting the empire. But Eteocles being violent and fierce from having possessed the empire, Jocasta could not reconcile her children.—Polynices, prepared as against an enemy, rushed out of the city. Now Tiresias prophesied that victory should be on the side of the Thebans, if Menœceus the son of Creon would give himself up to be sacrificed to Mars. Creon refused to give his son to the city, but the youth was willing, and, his father pointing out to him the means of flight and giving him money, he put himself to death.—The Thebans slew the leaders of the Argives. Eteocles and Polynices in a single combat slew each other, and their mother having found the corses of her sons laid violent hands on herself; and Creon her brother received the kingdom. The Argives defeated in battle retired. But Creon, being morose, would not give up those of the enemy who had fallen at Thebes, for sepulture, and exposed the body of Polynices without burial, and banished Œdipus from his country; in the one instance disregarding the laws of humanity, in the other giving way to passion, nor feeling pity for him after his calamity.\nTHE PHŒNICIAN VIRGINS.\nJOCASTA.\nO thou that cuttest thy path through the constellations[1] of heaven, and art mounted on thy golden-joined seats, thou sun, whirling thy flame with[2] thy swift steeds, how inauspicious didst thou dart thy ray on that day when Cadmus came to this land having left the sea-washed coast of Phœnicia; who in former time having married Harmonia, daughter of Venus, begat Polydorus; from him they say sprung Labdacus, and from him Laius. But I am[3] the daughter of Menœceus, and Creon my brother was born of the same mother; me they call Jocasta (for this name[4] my father gave me), and Laius takes me for his wife; but after that he was childless, for a long time sharing my bed in the palace, he went and inquired of Apollo, and at the same time demands the mutual offspring of male children in his family; but the God said, 'O king of Thebes renowned for its chariots, sow not for such a harvest of children against the will of the Gods, for if thou shalt beget a son, he that is born shall slay thee, and the whole of thy house shall wade through blood.' But having yielded to pleasure, and having fallen into inebriety, he begot to us a son, and having begot him, feeling conscious of his error and the command of the God, gives the babe to some herdsmen to expose at the meads of Juno and the rock of Cithæron, having bored sharp-pointed iron through the middle of his ankles, from which circumstance Greece gave him the name of Œdipus. But him the grooms who attend the steeds of Polybus find and carry home, and placed him in the arms of their mistress. But she rested beneath her bosom him that gave me a mother's pangs, and persuades her husband that she had brought forth. But now my son showing signs of manhood in his darkening cheek, either having suspected it by instinct, or having learned it from some one, went to the temple of Apollo, desirous of discovering his parents; at the same time went Laius my husband, seeking to gain intelligence of his son who had been exposed, if he were no longer living; and both met at the same point of the road at Phocis where it divides itself; and the charioteer of Laius commands him, 'Stranger, withdraw out of the way of princes;' but he moved slowly, in silence, with haughty spirit; but the steeds with their hoof dyed with blood the tendons of his feet. At this (but why need I relate each horrid circumstance besides the deed itself?) the son kills his father, and having taken the chariot, sends it as a present to his foster-father Polybus. Now at this time the sphinx preyed vulture-like[5] upon the city with rapacity, my husband now no more, Creon my brother proclaims that he will give my bed as a reward to him who would solve the enigma of the crafty virgin. But by some chance or other Œdipus my son happens to discover the riddle of the sphinx, [and he receives as a prize the sceptre of this land,][5a] and marries me, his mother, wretched he not knowing it, nor knew his mother that she was lying down with her son. And I bear children to my child, two sons, Eteocles and the illustrious Polynices, and two daughters, one her father named Ismene, the elder I called Antigone. But Œdipus, after having gone through all sufferings, having discovered in my bed the marriage with his mother, he perpetrated a deed of horror on his own eyes, having drenched in blood their pupils with his golden buckles. But after that the cheek of my children grows dark with manly down, they hid their father confined with bolts that his sad fortune might be forgotten, which indeed required the greatest policy. He is still living in the palace, but sick in mind through his misfortunes he imprecates the most unhallowed curses on his children, that they may share this house with the sharpened sword. But these two, dreading lest the Gods should bring to completion these curses,[6] should they dwell together, in friendly compact determined that Polynices the younger son should first go a willing exile from this land, but that Eteocles remaining here should hold the sceptre for a year, changing in his turn; but after that he sat on the throne of power, he moves not from his seat, but drives Polynices an exile from this land. But he having fled to Argos, and having contracted an alliance with Adrastus, assembles together and leads a vast army of Argives; and having marched to these very walls with seven gates he demands his father's sceptre and his share of the land. But I to quell this strife persuaded my son to come to his brother, confiding in a truce before he grasped the spear. And the messenger who was sent declares that he will come. But, O thou that inhabitest the shining clouds of heaven, Jove, preserve us, give reconciliation to my children; it becomes thee, if thou art wise, not to suffer the same man always to be unfortunate.\nTUTOR, ANTIGONE.\nTUT. O thou fair bud in thy father's house, Antigone, since thy mother has permitted thee to leave the virgin's apartments for the extreme chamber[7] of the mansion, in order to view the Argive army in compliance with thy entreaties, yet stay, until I shall first investigate the path, lest any citizen should appear in the pass, and to me taunts should come as a slave, and to thee as a princess: and I who well know each circumstance will tell you all that I saw or heard from the Argives, when I went bearing the offer of a truce to thy brother, from this place thither, and again to this place from him. But no citizen approaches this house; come, ascend with thy steps these ancient stairs of cedar, and survey the plains, and by the streams of Ismenus and Dirce's fount how great is the host of the enemy.\nANT. Stretch forth now, stretch forth thine aged hand from the stairs to my youth, raising up the steps of my feet.\nTUT. Behold, join thy hand, virgin, thou hast come in lucky hour, for the Pelasgian host is now in motion, and they are separating the bands from one another.\nANT. O awful daughter of Latona, Hecate, the field all brass[8] gleaming like lightning.\nTUT. For Polynices hath not come tamely to this land, raging with host of horsemen, and ten thousand shields.\nANT. Are the gates fastened with bars, and is the brazen bolt fitted to the stone-work of Amphion's wall?\nTUT. Take courage; as to the interior the city is safe, But view the first chief, if thou desirest to know.\nANT. Who is he with the white-plumed helmet, who commands in the van of the army, moving lightly round on his arm his brazen shield?\nTUT. He is a leader, lady.\nANT. Who is he? From whom sprung? Speak, aged man, what is he called by name?\nTUT. He indeed is called by birth a Mycenæan, and he dwells at the streams of Lerna,[9] the king Hippomedon.\nANT. Ah! how haughty, how terrible to behold! like to an earth-born giant, starlike in countenance amidst his painted devices,[10] he corresponds not with the race of mortals.\nTUT. Dost thou not see him now passing the stream of Dirce, a general?\nANT. Here is another, another fashion of arms. But who is he?\nTUT. He is the son of Œneus, Tydeus, and bears on his breast the Ætolian Mars.\nANT. Is this the prince, O aged man, who is husband to the sister of my brother's wife?[11] In his arms how different of color, of barbaric mixture!\nTUT. For all the Ætolians, my child, bear the target, and hurl with the lance, most certain in their aim.\nANT. But how, O aged man, dost thou know these things so perfectly?\nTUT. Having seen the devices of the shields, then I remarked them, when I went to bear the offer of a truce to thy brother, beholding which, I recognize the warriors.\nANT. But who is this, who is passing round the tomb of Zethus, with clustering locks, in his eyes a Gorgon to behold, in appearance a youth?\nTUT. A general he is. [See Note [A].]\nANT. How a crowd in complete armor attends him behind![12]\nTUT. This is Parthenopæus, son of Atalanta.\nANT. But, may Diana who rushes over the mountains with his mother destroy him, having subdued him with her arrows, who has come against my city to destroy it.\nTUT. May it be so, my child, nevertheless they are come with justice to this land; wherefore also I fear lest the Gods should judge rightly.\nANT. Where, but where is he who was born of one mother with me in hard fate, O dearest old man; tell me, where is Polynices?\nTUT. He is standing near the tomb of the seven virgin daughters of Niobe, close by Adrastus. Seest thou him?\nANT. I see indeed, but not distinctly; but somehow I see the resemblance of his form, and his shape shadowed out. Would that with my feet I could perform the journey of the winged cloud through the air to my brother, then would I fling my arms round his dearest neck, after so long a time a wretched exile. How splendid is he, O old man, in his golden armor, glittering like the morning rays of the sun.\nTUT. He will come to this house confiding in the truce, so as to fill thee with joy.\nANT. But who, O aged man, is this, who guides his milk-white steeds seated in his chariot?\nTUT. The prophet Amphiaraus this, O my mistress, and with him the victims, the libations of the earth delighting in blood.\nAST. O thou daughter of the brightly girded sun, thou moon, golden-circled light, applying what quiet and temperate blows to his steeds does he direct his chariot! But where is he who utters such dreadful insults against this city, Capaneus?\nTUT. He is scanning the approach to the towers, measuring the walls both from their foundation to the top.\nANT. O vengeance, and ye loud-roaring thunders of Jove, and thou blasting fire of the lightning, do thou quell this more-than-mortal arrogance. This is he who will with his spear give to Mycenæ, and to the streams of Lernæan Triæna,[13] and to the Amymonian[14] waters of Neptune, the Theban women, having invested them with slavery. Sever, O awful Goddess, never, O daughter of Jove, with golden clusters of ringlets, Diana, may I endure servitude.\nTUT. My child, enter the palace, and at home remain in thy virgin chambers, since thou hast arrived at the indulgement of thy desire, as to what you were anxious to behold. For, since confusion has entered the city, a crowd of women is advancing to the royal palace. The race of women is prone to complaint, and if they find but small occasion for words, they add more, and it is a sort of pleasure to women, to speak nothing well-advised one of another.[15]\nCHORUS.\nI have come, having left the Tyrian wave, the first-fruits of Loxias, from the sea-washed Phœnicia, a slave for the shrine of Apollo, that I might dwell under the snowy brows of Parnassus, having sped my way over the Ionian flood by the oar, the west wind with its blasts riding over the barren plains of waters[16] which flow round Sicily, the sweetest murmur in the heavens. Chosen out from my city the fairest present to Apollo, I came to the land of the Cadmeans, the illustrious descendants of Agenor, sent hither to these kindred towers of Laius. And I am made the slave of Apollo in like manner with the golden-framed images. Moreover the water of Castalia awaits me, to lave the virgin pride of my tresses, in the ministry of Apollo. O blazing rock, the flame of fire that seems[17] double above the Dionysian heights of Bacchus, and thou vine, who distillest the daily nectar, producing the fruitful cluster from the tender shoot; and ye divine caves of the dragon,[18] and ye mountain watch-towers of the Gods, and thou hallowed snowy mountain, would that I were the chorus of the immortal God free from alarms encompassing thee around, by the caves of Apollo in the centre of the earth, having left Dirce. But now impetuous Mars having advanced before the walls lights up against this city, which may the Gods avert, hostile war; for common are the misfortunes of friends, and common is it, if this land defended by its seven turrets should suffer any calamity, to the Phœnician country, alas! alas! common is the affinity,[19] common are the descendants of Io bearing horns; of which woes I have a share. But a thick cloud of shields glares around the city, the likeness of gory battle, bearing which destruction from the Furies to the children of Œdipus Mars shall quickly advance. O Pelasgian Argos, I dread thy power, and vengeance from the Gods, for he rushes not his arms to this war unjustly, who seeks to recover his home.\nPOLYNICES, CHORUS.\nPOL. The bolts indeed of the gate-keepers have with ease admitted me, that I might come within the walls; wherefore also I fear, lest, having caught me within their nets, they let[19a] not my body go without bloodshed. On which account my eye must be turned about on every side, both that way and this, lest there be treachery. But armed in my hand with this sword, I will give myself confidence of daring. Ha! Who is this; or do we fear a noise? Every thing appears terrible even to the bold, when his foot shall pass across a hostile country. I trust however in my mother, at the same time I scarce trust, who persuaded me to come hither confiding in a truce. But protection is nigh; for the hearths of the altars are at hand, and houses not deserted. Come. I will let go my sword into its dark scabbard, and will question these who they are, that are standing at the palace. Ye female strangers, tell me, from what country do ye approach Grecian habitations?\nCHOR. The Phœnician is my paternal country, she that nurtured me: and the descendants of Agenor sent me hither from the spoils, the first-fruits to Apollo. And while the renowned son of Œdipus was preparing to send me to the revered shrine, and to the altars of Phœbus, in the mean time the Argives marched against the city. But do thou in turn answer me, who thou art, who hast come to this bulwark of the Theban land with its seven gates?\nPOL. My father is Œdipus the son of Laius; Jocasta daughter of Menœceus brought me forth; the Theban people call me Polynices.\nCHOR. O thou allied to the sons of Agenor, my lords, by whom I was sent, I fall at thy knees in lowly posture, O king, preserving my country's custom. Thou hast come, thou hast come, after a length of time, to thy paternal land. O venerable matron, come forth quickly, open the doors; dost thou hear, O mother, that producedst this hero? why dost thou delay to leave thy lofty mansion, and to embrace thy child with thine arms?\nJOCASTA, POLYNICES, CHORUS.\nJOC. Hearing the Phœnician tongue, ye virgins, within this mansion, I drag my steps trembling with age. Ah! my son, after length of time, after numberless days, I behold thy countenance; clasp thy mother's bosom in thine arms, throw around her[20] thy kisses, and the dark ringlets of thy clustering hair, shading my neck. Ah! scarce possible is it that thou appearest in thy mother's arms so unhoped for, and so unexpected. How shall I address thee? how shall I perform all? how shall I, walking in rapture around thee on that side and this, both with my hands and words, reap the varied pleasure, the delight of my former joys? O my son, thou hast left thy father's house deserted, sent away an exile by wrongful treatment from thy brother. How longed for by thy friends! how longed for by Thebes! From which time I am both shorn of my hoary locks, letting them fall with tears, with wailing;[21] deprived, my child, of the white robes, I receive in exchange around me these dark and dismal weeds. But the old man in the palace deprived of sight, always preserving with tears regret for the unanimity of the brothers which is separated from the family, has madly rushed on self-destruction with the sword and with the noose above the beams of the house, bewailing the curse imprecated on his children; and with cries of woe he is always hidden in darkness. But thou, my child, I hear, art both joined in marriage, and hast the joys of love in a foreign family, and cherishest a foreign alliance; intolerable to this thy mother and to the aged Laius, the woe of a foreign marriage brought upon us. But neither did I light the torch of fire for you, as is customary in the marriage rites, as befits the happy mother; nor was Ismenus careful of the bridal rites in the luxury of the bath: and the entrance of thy bride was made in silence through the Theban city. May these ills perish, whether the sword, or discord, or thy father is the cause, or whether fate has rushed with violence upon the house of Œdipus; for the weight of these sorrows has fallen upon me.\nCHOR. Parturition with the attendant throes has a wonderful effect on women;[22] and somehow the whole race of women have strong affection toward their children.\nPOL. My mother, determining wisely, and yet not determining wisely, have I come to men my foes; but it is necessary that all must be enamored of their country; but whoever says otherwise, pleases himself with vain words, but has his heart there. But so far have I come to trouble and terror, lest any treachery from my brother should slay me, so that having my hand on my sword I proceeded through the city rolling round my eye; but one thing is on my side, the truce and thy faith, which has brought me within my paternal walls: but I have come with many tears, after a length of time beholding the courts and the altars of the Gods, and the schools wherein I was brought up, and the fount of Dirce, from which banished by injustice, I inhabit a foreign city, having a stream of tears flowing through my eyes. But, for from one woe springs a second, I behold thee having thy head shorn of its locks, and these sable garments; alas me! on account of my misfortunes. How dreadful a thing, mother, is the enmity of relations, having means of reconciliation seldom to be brought about! For how fares the old man my father in the palace, vainly looking upon darkness; and how fare my two sisters? Are they indeed bewailing my wretched banishment?\nJOC. Some God miserably destroys the race of Œdipus; for thus began it, when I brought forth children in that unhallowed manner, and thy father married me in evil hour, and thou didst spring forth. But why relate these things? What is sent by the Gods we must bear. But how I may ask the questions I wish, I know not, for I fear lest I wound at all thy feelings; but I have a great desire.\nPOL. But inquire freely, leave nothing out. For what you wish, my mother, this is dear to me.\nJOC. I ask thee therefore, first, for the information that I wish to obtain. What is the being deprived of one's country, is it a great ill?\nPOL. The greatest: and greater is it in deed than in word.\nJOC. What is the reason of that? What is that so harsh to exiles?\nPOL. One thing, and that the greatest, not to have the liberty of speaking.\nJOC. This that you have mentioned belongs to a slave, not to give utterance to what one thinks.\nPOL. It is necessary to bear with the follies of those in power.\nJOC. And this is painful, to be unwise with the unwise.\nPOL. But for interest we must bend to slavery contrary to our nature.\nJOC. But hopes support exiles, as report goes.\nPOL. They look upon them with favorable eyes, at least, but are slow of foot.\nJOC. Hath not time shown them to be vain?\nPOL. They have a certain sweet delight to set against misfortunes.\nJOC. But whence wert thou supported, before thou foundest means of sustenance by thy marriage?\nPOL. At one time I had food for the day, at another I had not.\nJOC. And did the friends and hosts of your father not assist you?\nPOL. Be prosperous, and thou shalt have friends:[23] but friends are none, should one be in adversity.\nJOC. Did not thy noble birth raise thee to great distinction?\nPOL. To want is wretched; high birth fed me not.\nJOC. Their own country, it appears, is the dearest thing to men.\nPOL. You can not express by words how dear it is.\nJOC. But how camest thou to Argos? What intention hadst thou?\nPOL. Apollo gave a certain oracle to Adrastus.\nJOC. What is this thou hast mentioned? I am unable to discover.\nPOL. To unite his daughters in marriage with a boar and lion.\nJOC. And what part of the name of beasts belongs to you, my son.\nPOL. I know not. The God called me to this fortune.\nJOC. For the God is wise. But in what manner didst thou obtain her bed?\nPOL. It was night; but I came to the portals of Adrastus.\nJOC. In search of a couch to rest on, as a wandering exile?\nPOL. This was the case, and then indeed there came a second exile.\nJOC. Who was this? how unfortunate then was he also!\nPOL. Tydeus, who they say sprung from Œneus his sire.\nJOC. In what then did Adrastus liken you to beasts?\nPOL. Because we came to blows for lodging.\nJOC. In this the son of Talaus understood the oracle.\nPOL. And gave in marriage to us two his two virgin daughters.\nJOC. Art thou fortunate then in thy marriage alliance, or unfortunate?\nPOL. My marriage can not be found fault with up to this day.\nJOC. But how didst thou persuade an army to follow you hither?\nPOL. Adrastus swore this oath to his two sons-in-law, that he would replace both in their own country, but me first. And many princes of the Argives and Mycenæans are at hand, rendering to me a sad, but necessary favor; for I am leading an army against this my own city; but I have called the Gods to witness how unwillingly I have raised the spear against my dearest parents. But the dissolution of these ills extends to thee, my mother, that having reconciled the friendly brothers, you may free from toil me and thyself, and the whole city. It is a proverb long ago chanted, but nevertheless I will repeat it; wealth is honored most of all things by men, and has the greatest influence of any thing among men. In pursuit of which I am come, leading hither ten thousand spears: for a nobly-born man in poverty is nothing.\nCHOR. And see Eteocles here comes to this mediation; thy business it is, O Jocasta, being their mother, to speak words, with which thou shalt reconcile thy children.\nETEOCLES, POLYNICES, JOCASTA, CHORUS.\nETEO. Mother, I am present; giving this grace to thee, I have come; what must I do? Let some one begin the conference. Since arranging also around the walls the chariots of the bands, I restrained the city, that I may hear from thee the common terms[24] of reconciliation, for which thou hast permitted this man to come within the walls under sanction of a truce, having persuaded me.\nJOC. Stay; precipitate haste has not justice; but slow counsels perform most deeds in wisdom. But repress that fierce eye and those blasts of rage; for thou art not looking on the Gorgon's head cut off at the neck, but thou art looking on thy brother who is come to thee. And do thou again, Polynices, turn thy face toward thy brother; for looking at the same point with thine eyes, thou wilt both speak better, and receive his words better. But I wish to give you a wise piece of advice. When a friend is enraged with a man his friend, having met him face to face, let him fix his eyes on his friend's eyes, this only ought he to consider, the end for which he is come, but to have no recollection of former grievances. Thy words then first, my son, Polynices; for thou art come leading an army of Argives, having suffered injustice, as thou sayest; and may some God be umpire and the reconciler of your strife.\nPOL. The speech of truth is simple, and those things which are just need not wily interpretations; for they have energy themselves; but the unjust speech, unsound in itself, requires cunning preparations to gloze it. But I have previously considered for my father's house, and my own advantage and that of this man; desiring to escape the curses, which Œdipus denounced formerly against us, I myself of my own accord departed from this land, having given him to rule over his own country for the space of a year, so that I myself should have the government again, having received it in turn, and not having come into enmity and bloodshed with this man to perform some evil deed, and to suffer what is now taking place. But he having assented to this, and having brought the Gods to witness his oaths, has performed nothing of what he promised, but himself holds the regal power and my share of the palace. And now I am ready, having received my own right, to send the army away from out of this land, and to regulate my house, having received it in my turn, and to give it up again to this man for the same space of time, and neither to lay my country waste, nor to apply to its towers the means of ascent by the firmly-fixed ladders. Which, should I not meet with justice, will I endeavor to put in execution: and I call the Gods as witnesses of this, that acting in every thing with justice, I am without justice deprived of my country in the most unrighteous manner. These individual circumstances, mother, not having collected together intricacies of argument, have I declared, but both to the wise and to the illiterate just, as appears to me.\nCHOR. To me indeed, although we have not been brought up according to the Grecian land, nevertheless to me thou appearest to speak with judgment.\nETEO. If the same thing were judged honorable alike by all, and at the same time wise, there would not be doubtful strife among men. But now nothing is similar, nothing the same among mortals, except in names; but the sense is not the same, for I, my mother, will speak having kept nothing back; I would mount to the rising of the stars, and sink beneath the earth, were I able to perform this, so that I might possess the greatest of the Goddesses, kingly power.[25] This prize then, my mother, I am not willing rather to give up to another, than to preserve for myself. For it implies cowardice in him, whoever having lost the greater share, hath received the less; but in addition to this I feel ashamed, that this man having come with arms, and laying the country waste, should obtain what he wishes; for to Thebes this would be a reproach, if through fear of the Mycenæan spear I should give up my sceptre for this man to hold. But he ought, my mother, to effect a reconciliation, not by arms: for speech does every thing which even the sword of the enemy could do. But if he is desirous of inhabiting this land in any other way, it is in his power; but the other point I will never give up willingly. When it is in my power to rule, ever to be a slave to him? Wherefore come fire, come sword, yoke thy steeds, fill the plains with chariots, since I will not give up my kingly power to this man. For if one must be unjust, it is most glorious to be unjust concerning empire, but in every thing else one should be just.\nCHOR. It is not right to speak well, where the deeds are not glorious; for this is not honorable, but galling to justice.\nJOC. My son, Eteocles, not every ill is added to age, but experience has it in its power to evince more wisdom than youth.[26] Why, my child, dost thou so desirously court ambition, the most baneful of the deities? do not thou; the Goddess is unjust. But she hath entered into many families and happy states and hath come forth again, to the destruction of those who have to do with her. Of whom thou art madly enamored. This is more noble, my son, to honor equality, which ever links friends with friends, and states with states, and allies with allies: for equality is sanctioned by law among men. But the lesser share is ever at enmity with the greater, and straight begins the day of hatred. For equality arranged also among mortals measures, and the divisions of weights, and defined numbers. And the dark eye of night, and the light of the sun, equally walk their annual round, and neither of them being overcome hath envy of the other. Thus the sun and the night are subservient to men, but wilt not thou brook having an equal share of government, and give his share to him? Then where is justice? Why dost thou honor so unboundedly that prosperous injustice, royalty, and think so highly of her? Is the being conspicuous honorable? At least, it is empty honor. Or dost thou desire to labor much, possessing much in thy house? but what is superfluity? It possesses but a name; since a sufficiency indeed to the temperate is abundance. Neither do men enjoy riches as their own, but having the property of the Gods do we cherish them. And when they list, again do they take them away. Come, if I ask thee, having proposed together two measures, whether it is thy wish to reign, or save the city? Wilt thou say, to reign? But should he conquer thee, and the Argive spears overcome the Cadmæanforces, thou wilt behold this city of the Thebans vanquished, thou wilt behold many captive maidens with violence ravished by men your foes. Bitter then to Thebes will be the power which thou seekest to hold; but yet thou art ambitious of it. To thee I say this: but to thee, Polynices, say I, that Adrastus hath conferred an unwise favor on thee; and foolishly hast thou also come to destroy this city. Come, if thou wilt subdue this land (may which never happen), by the Gods, how wilt thou erect trophies of thy spear? And how again wilt thou sacrifice the first-fruits, having conquered thy country? and how wilt thou engrave upon the spoils by the waters of Inachus, 'Having laid Thebes in ashes, Polynices consecrated these shields to the Gods?' Never, my son, may it come to thee to receive such glory from the Greeks. But again, shouldest thou be conquered, and should the arms of the other prevail, how wilt thou return to Argos having left behind ten thousand dead? Surely some one will say, O! unfortunate marriage alliance! O Adrastus, who placed them on us, through the nuptials of one bride we are lost! Thou art hastening two ills, my son, to be deprived of those, and to fail in this. Give up your too great ardor, give it up; the follies of two when they clash together in the same point, are the most hateful ill.\nCHOR. O ye Gods, may ye be averters of these ills, and grant to the children of Œdipus some means of agreement.\nETEO. My mother, this is not a contest of words, but intervening time is fruitlessly wasted; and thy earnestness avails nothing; for we shall not agree in any other way, than on the terms proposed, that I holding the sceptre be monarch of this land. Forbearing then tedious admonitions, let me have my way; and do thou begone from out these walls, or thou shalt die.\nPOL. By whose hand? Who is there so invulnerable, who having pointed the murderous sword against me, shall not bear the same fate?\nETEO. He is near, not far removed from thee: dost thou look on these my hands?\nPOL. I see them. But wealth is cowardly, and feeble, loving life.\nETEO. And therefore hast thou come, with such a host against one who is nothing in arms?\nPOL. For a cautious general is better than one daring.\nETEO. Thou art insolent, having trusted in the truce, which preserves you from death.\nPOL. A second time again I demand of you the sceptre and my share of the land.\nETEO. I will admit no demand, for I will regulate my own family.\nPOL. Holding more than your share?\nETEO. I own it; but quit this land.\nPOL. O ye altars of my paternal Gods.\nETEO. Which thou art come to destroy?\nPOL. Do ye hear me?\nETEO. Who will hear thee, who art marching against thy country?\nPOL. And ye shrines of the Gods[27] delighting in the milk-white steeds;\nETEO. Who hate thee.\nPOL. I am driven out of my own country.\nETEO. For thou hast come to destroy it.\nPOL. With injustice indeed, O ye Gods!\nETEO. At Mycenæ call upon the Gods, not here.\nPOL. Thou art impious.\nETEO. But not my country's enemy, as thou art.\nPOL. Who drives me out without my share.\nETEO. And I will put thee to death in addition.\nPOL. My father, hearest thou what I suffer?\nETEO. For he hears what wrongs thou doest.\nPOL. And thou, my mother?\nETEO. It is not lawful for thee to mention thy mother.\nPOL. O my city!\nETEO. To Argos go, and call on Lerna's stream.\nPOL. I will go, do not distress thyself; but thee, my mother, I mention with honor.\nETEO. Depart from out of the country.\nPOL. I will go out; but grant me to see my father.\nETEO. You will not obtain your request.\nPOL. But my virgin sisters then.\nETEO. Never shalt thou behold these.\nPOL. O my sisters!\nETEO. Why callest thou on these—being their greatest enemy?\nPOL. My mother, but thou farewell.\nJOC. Do I experience any thing that is well, my son?\nPOL. I am no longer thy child.\nJOC. To many troubles was I born.\nPOL. For he throws insults on us.\nETEO. For I am insulted in turn.\nPOL. Where wilt thou stand before the towers?\nETEO. Why dost thou ask me this question?\nPOL. I will oppose myself to thee, to slay thee.\nETEO. Desire of this seizes me also.\nJOC. Wretched me! what will ye do, my children?\nPOL. The deed itself will show.\nJOC. Will ye not escape your father's curses?\nETEO. Let the whole house perish!\nPOL. Since soon my blood-stained sword will not remain any longer in inactivity. But I call to witness the land that nurtured me, and the Gods, how dishonored I am driven from this land, suffering such foul treatment, as a slave and not born of the same father Œdipus. And if any thing befalls thee, my city, blame not me, but him; for against my will have I come, and against my will am I driven from this land. And thou, king Apollo, God of our streets, and ye shrines, farewell, and ye my equals, and ye altars of the Gods receiving the victims; for I know not if it is allowed me ever again to address you. But hope does not yet slumber, in which I have trusted with the favor of the Gods, that having slain this man, I shall be master of this Theban land.\nETEO. Depart from out of the country; with truth indeed did your father give you the name of Polynices by some divine foreknowledge, a name corresponding with strife.\nCHORUS.\nCadmus came from Tyre to this land, before whom the quadrupede heifer bent with willing fall,[28] showing the accomplishment of the oracle, where the divine word ordered him to colonize the plains of the Aonians productive of wheat, where indeed the fair-flowing stream of the water of Dirce passes over the verdant and deep-furrowed fields, where the * * * * mother produced Bacchus, by her marriage with Jove, whom the wreathed ivy twining around him instantly, while yet a babe, blest and covered with its verdant shady branches, an event to be celebrated with Bacchic revel by the Theban virgins and inspired women. There was the bloodstained dragon of Mars, the savage guard, watching with far-rolling eyeballs over the flowing fountains and grassy streams; whom Cadmus, having come for water for purification, slew with a fragment of rock, the destroyer of the monster having thrown his arms with blows on his blood-stained head, by the counsel of the divine Pallas born without mother, having thrown the teeth fallen to the earth upon the deep-furrowed plains. Whence the earth sent forth a spectacle, an armed [host] above the extreme limits of the ground; but iron-hearted slaughter again united them with their beloved earth; and sprinkled with blood the ground which showed them to the serene gales of the air. And thee, sprung of old from our ancestor Io, Epaphus, O progeny of Jove, on thee have I called, have I called in a foreign tongue, with prayers in foreign accent, come, come to this land (thy descendants have founded it), where the two Goddesses Proserpine and the dear Goddess Ceres, queen of all (since earth nurtures all things), have held their possessions, send the fire-bearing Goddesses to defend this land: since every thing is easy to the Gods.\nETEOCLES, CHORUS, MESSENGER.\nETEO. Go thou, and bring hither Creon son of Menœceus, the brother of my mother Jocasta, saying this, that I wish to communicate with him counsels of a private nature and those which concern the common welfare of the country, before we go into battle and the ranks of war. And see, he spares the trouble of your steps, by his presence; for I see him coming toward my palace.\nCREON, ETEOCLES, CHORUS.\nCRE. Surely have I visited many places, desiring to see you, O king Eteocles! and I have gone round to the gates and the guards of the Thebans, seeking you.\nETEO. And indeed I have wished to see you, Creon, for I found attempts at reconciliation altogether fail when I came and entered into conference with Polynices.\nCRE. I have heard that he aspires to higher thoughts than Thebes, having trusted in his alliance with Adrastus and his army. But it becomes us to hold these things in dependence on the Gods. But what is most immediately before us, this am I come to acquaint you with.\nETEO. What is this? for I understand not your speech.\nCRE. A prisoner is arrived from the Argives.\nETEO. Does he bring us any news of those stationed there?\nCRE. The Argive army is preparing quickly to surround the city of the Thebans with thickly-ranged arms.(Note [B].)\nETEO. Therefore must we draw our forces out of the Theban city.\nCRE. Whither? Dost thou not in the impetuosity of youth see what it behooves thee to see?\nETEO. Without these trenches, as we are quickly about to fight.\nCRE. Small are the forces of this land; but theirs innumerable.\nETEO. I know that they are bold in words.\nCRE. Argos of the Greeks has some renown.\nETEO. Be confident; quickly will I fill the plain with their slaughter.\nCRE. I would it were so: but this I see is a work of much labor.\nETEO. Know that I will not restrain my forces within the walls.\nCRE. And yet the whole of victory is prudence.\nETEO. Dost thou wish then that I have recourse to other measures?\nCRE. To every measure indeed, rather than hazard all on one battle.\nETEO. What if we were to attack them by night from ambush?\nCRE. If, having failed, at least you can have a safe retreat hither.\nETEO. Night brings the same advantage to all, but more to the daring.\nCRE. Dreadful is it to fail in the darkness of night.\nETEO. But shall I lead my force against them while at their meal?\nCRE. That would cause terror; but we must conquer.\nETEO. The ford of Dirce is indeed deep to pass.\nCRE. Every thing is inferior to a good guard.\nETEO. What then, shall I charge the Argive army with my cavalry?\nCRE. And there the army is fenced round with chariots.\nETEO. What then shall I do? give up the city to the enemy?\nCRE. By no means; but deliberate if thou art wise.\nETEO. What more prudent forethought is there?\nCRE. They say that they have seven men, as I have heard.\nETEO. What have they been commanded to do? for their strength is small.\nCRE. To head their bands, to besiege the seven gates.\nETEO. What then shall we do? I will not wait this indecision.\nCRE. Do thou thyself also choose seven men for the gates.\nETEO. To head divisions, or for single combat?\nCRE. To head divisions, having selected the bravest.\nETEO. I understand you; to guard the approach to the walls.\nCRE. And with them other generals; one man sees not every thing?\nETEO. Having chosen them for boldness, or prudence in judgment?\nCRE. For both; for one without the other availeth nothing.\nETEO. It shall be so: and having gone to the city of the seven towers, I will appoint chiefs at the gates, as you advise, having opposed equal champions against equal foes. But to mention the name of each would be a great delay, the enemy encamped under our very walls. But I will go, that I may not be idle with my hand. And may it befall me to find my brother opposed to me, and being joined with me in battle, to take him with my spear, [and to slay him, who came to desolate my country.] But it is thy duty to attend to the marriage of my sister Antigone and thy son Hæmon, if I fail aught of success; but the firm vow made before I now confirm at my going out. Thou art my mother's brother, why need I use more words? Treat her worthily, both for thine own and my sake. But my father incurs the punishment of the rashness he brought upon himself, having quenched his sight; I praise him not; even us will he put to death with his execrations, should he gain his point. But one thing is left undone by us, if the soothsayer Tiresias have any oracle to deliver, to enquire this of him; but I will send thy son, Creon, Menœceus, of the same name with thy father, to bring Tiresias hither. With pleasure will he enter into conversation with you; but I lately reviled him with his divining art, so that he is offended with me. But this charge I give the city with thee, Creon; if my arms should conquer, that the body of Polynices be never buried in this Theban land; but that the man who buries him shall die, although he be a friend. This I have told you: but my attendants I tell, bring out my arms, and my panoply which covers me, that we may go this appointed contest of the spear with victorious justice. But to Caution, the most valued of the Goddesses, will we address our prayers to preserve this city.\nCHORUS.\nO Mars, cause of infinite woe, why, I pray, art thou so possessed with blood and death, so discordant with the revels of Bacchus? Thou dost not in the circle of beautiful dancers in the bloom of youth, having let flow thy hair,[29] on the breath of the flute modulate strains, in which there is a lovely power to renew the dance. But with thy armed men, having excited the army of Argives against Thebes with blood, thou dancest before the city in a most inharmonious revel, thou movest not thy foot maddened by the thyrsus clad in fawn-skins, but thy solid-hoofed steed with thy chariot and horses' bits; and bounding at the streams of Ismenus, thou art borne rapidly in the chariot-course, having excited against the race of those sown [by Cadmus,] a raging host that grasp the shield, well armed, adverse to us at the walls of stone: surely Discord is some dreadful Goddess, who devised all these calamities against the princes of this land, the Labdacidæ involved in woe. O thou forest of heavenly foliage, most productive of beasts, thou snowy eye of Diana, Cithæron, never oughtest thou to have nourished him doomed to death, the son of Jocasta, Œdipus, the babe who was cast out from his home, marked by the golden clasps. Neither ought that winged virgin the Sphinx, thou mountain monster, that grief to this land, to have come, with her most inharmonious lays; who formerly approaching our walls, bore in her four talons the descendants of Cadmus to the inaccessible light of heaven, whom the infernal Pluto sends against the Thebans; but other ill-fated discord among the children of Œdipus springs up in the palace and in the city. For that which is not honorable, never can be honorable, as neither can children the unhallowed offspring of the mother, the pollution of the father. But she came to a kindred bed. Thou didst produce, O [Theban] land! thou didst produce formerly (as I heard the foreign report,[30] I heard it formerly at home), the race sprung from teeth from the fiery-crested dragon fed on beasts, the proudest honor of Thebes. But to the nuptials of Harmonia the Gods came of old, and by the harp and by the lyre of Amphion uprose the walls of Thebes the tower of the double streams,[31] at the midst of the pass of Dirce, which waters the verdant plain before Ismenus. And Io, our ancient mother, doomed to bear horns, brought forth a line of Theban kings. But this city receiving ten thousand goods one in change for another, hath stood in the highest chaplets of war.\nTIRESIAS (led by his daughter), MENŒCEUS, CREON, CHORUS.\nTIR. Lead onward, my daughter, since thou art an eye to my blind steps, as the star to the mariners. Placing my steps hither on this level plain, proceed lest we stumble; thy father is feeble; and preserve carefully in thy virgin hand my calculations which I took, having learned the auguries of the birds, sitting in the sacred seats where I fortell the future. My child, Menœceus, son of Creon, tell me, how far is the remainder of the journey through the city to thy father? Since my knees are weary, and with difficulty I accomplish such a long journey.\nCRE. Be of good cheer; for thou hast steered thy foot, Tiresias, near to thy friends; but take hold of him, my son. Since every chariot,[32] and the foot of the aged man is used to expect the assistance of another's hand.\nTIR. Well: I am present; but why didst thou call me with such haste, Creon?\nCRE. We have not as yet forgotten: but recover thy strength, and collect thy breath, having thrown aside the fatigue occasioned by the journey.\nTIR. I am relaxed indeed[32a] with toil, brought hither from the Athenians the day before this. For there also was a contest of the spear with Eumolpus, where I made the descendants of Cecrops splendid conquerors. And I wear this golden chaplet, as thou seest, having received the first-fruits of the spoil of the enemy.\nCRE. Thy victorious garlands I make a happy omen. For we, as thou well knowest, are tossing in a storm of war with the Greeks, and great is the hazard of Thebes. The king Eteocles has therefore gone forth adorned with his armor already to battle with the Argives. But to me has he sent that I might learn from you, by doing what we should be most likely to preserve the city.\nTRE. For Eteocles' sake indeed I would have stopped my mouth, and repressed the oracles, but to thee, since thou desirest to know them, will I declare them: for this land labors under the malady of old, O Creon, from the time when Laïus became the father of children in spite of the Gods, and begat the wretched Œdipus, a husband for his mother. But the cruel lacerations of his eyes were in the wisdom of the Gods, and a warning to Greece. Which things the sons of Œdipus seeking to conceal among themselves by the lapse of time, as about forsooth to escape from the Gods, erred through their ignorance, for they neither giving the honor due to their father, nor allowing him a free liberty, infuriated the unfortunate man: and he breathed out against them dreadful threats, being both in affliction, and moreover dishonored. And I, what things omitting to do, and what words omitting to speak on the subject, have nevertheless fallen into the hatred of the sons of Œdipus? But death from their mutual hands is near them, O Creon. And many corses fallen around corses, having mingled the weapons of Argos and Thebes, shall cause bitter lamentations to the Theban land. And thou, O wretched city, art sapped from thy foundations, unless men will obey my words. For this were the first thing, that not any of the family of Œdipus should be citizens, nor king of the territory, inasmuch as they are possessed by demons, and are they that will overthrow the city. And since the evil triumphs over the good, there is one other thing requisite to insure preservation. But, as this is neither safe for me to say, and distressing to those on whom the lot has fallen, to give to the city the balm of preservation, I will depart: farewell; for being an individual with many shall I suffer what is about to happen if it must be so; for what can I do![33]\nCRE. Stay here, old man.\nTIR. Lay not hold upon me.\nCRE. Remain; why dost thou fly me?\nTIR. Thy fortune flies thee, but not I.\nCRE. Tell me the means of preserving the citizens and their city.\nTRE. Thou wishest now indeed, and soon thou wilt not wish.\nCRE. And how am I not willing to preserve my country?\nTIR. Art thou willing then to hear, and art thou eager?\nCRE. For toward what ought I to have a greater eagerness?\nTIR. Hear now then my prophecies.—But this first I wish to ascertain clearly, where is Menœceus who brought me hither.\nCRE. He is not far off, but close to thee.\nTIR. Let him depart then afar from my oracles.\nCRE. He that is my son will keep secret what ought to be kept secret.\nTIR. Art thou willing then that I speak in his presence?\nCRE. Yes: for he would be delighted to hear of the means of preservation.\nTIR. Hear now then the tenor of my oracles; what things doing ye may preserve the city of the Cadmeans. It is necessary for thee to sacrifice this thy son Menœceus for the country, since thou thyself callest for this fortune.\nCRE. What sayest thou, what word is this thou hast spoken, old man?\nTIR. As circumstances are, thus also oughtest thou to act.\nCRE. O thou, that hast said many evils in a short time!\nTIR. To thee at least; but to thy country great and salutary.\nCRE. I heard not, I attended not; let the city go where it will.\nTIR. This is no longer the same man; he retracts again what he said.\nCRE. Farewell! depart; for I have no need of thy prophecies.\nTIR. Has truth perished, because thou art unfortunate?\nCRE. By thy knees I implore thee, and by thy reverend locks.\nTIR. Why kneel to me? the evils thou askest are hard to be controlled. (Note [E].)\nCRE. Keep it secret; and speak not these words to the city.\nTIR. Dost thou command me to be unjust? I can not be silent.\nCRE. What then wilt thou do to me? Wilt thou slay my son?\nTIR. These things will be a care to others; but by me will it be spoken.\nCRE. But from whence has this evil come to me, and to my child?\nTIR. Well dost thou ask me, and comest to the drift of my discourse. It is necessary that he, stabbed in that cave where the earth-born dragon lay, the guardian of Dirce's fountain, give his gory blood a libation to the earth on account of the ancient wrath of Mars against Cadmus, who avenges the slaughter of the earth-born dragon; and these things done, ye shall obtain Mars as your ally. But if the earth receive fruit in return for fruit, and mortal blood in return for blood, ye shall have that land propitious, which formerly sent forth a crop of men from seed armed with golden helmets; but there must of this race die one, who is the son of the dragon's jaw. But thou art left among us of the race of those sown men, pure in thy descent, both by thy mother's side and in the male line; and thy children too: Hæmon's marriage however precludes his being slain, for he is not a youth, [for, although he has not approached her bed, he has yet contracted the marriage.] But this youth, devoted to this city, by dying may preserve his native country. And he will cause a bitter return to Adrastus and the Argives, casting back death over their eyes, and Thebes will he make illustrious: of these two fates choose the one; either preserve thy child or the state. Every information from me thou hast:—lead me, my child, toward home;—but whoever exercises the art of divination, is a fool; if indeed he chance to show disagreeable things, he is rendered hateful to those to whom he may prophesy; but speaking falsely to his employers from motives of pity, he is unjust as touching the Gods.—Phœbus alone should speak in oracles to men, who fears nobody.\nCREON, MENŒCEUS, CHORUS.\nCHOR. Creon, why art thou mute compressing thy voice in silence, for to me also there is no less consternation.\nCRE. But what can one say?—It is clear however what my answer will be. For never will I go to this degree of calamity, to expose my son a victim for the state. For all men live with an affection toward their children, nor would any give up his own child to die. Let no one praise me for the deed, and slay my children. But I myself, for I am arrived at a mature period of life, am ready to die to liberate my country. But haste, my son, before the whole city hears it, disregarding the intemperate oracles of prophets, fly as quickly as possible, having quitted this land. For he will tell these things to the authorities and chiefs, going to the seven gates, and to the officers: and if indeed we get before him, there is safety for thee, but if thou art too late, we are undone, thou diest.\nMEN. Whither then fly? To what city? what friends?\nCRE. Wheresoever thou wilt be farthest removed from this country.\nMEN. Therefore it is fitting for thee to speak, and for me to do.\nCRE. Having passed through Delphi—\nMEN. Whither is it right for me to go, my father?\nCRE. To the land of Ætolia.\nMEN. And from this whither shall I proceed?\nCRE. To Thesprotia's soil.\nMEN. To the sacred seat of Dodona?\nCRE. Thou understandest.\nMEN. What then will there be to protect me?\nCRE. The conducting deity.\nMEN. But what means of procuring money?\nCRE. I will supply gold.\nMEN. Thou sayest well, my father. Go then, for having proceeded to salute[34] thy sister, whose breast I first sucked, Jocasta I mean, deprived of my mother, and reft from her, an orphan, I will depart and save my life. But haste, go, let not thy purpose be hindered.\nMENŒCEUS, CHORUS.\nMEN. Ye females, how well removed I my father's fears, having deceived him with words, in order to gain my wishes; who sends me out of the way, depriving the city of its good fortune, and gives me up to cowardice. And these things are pardonable indeed in an old man, but in my case it deserves no pardon to become the deserter of that country which gave me birth. That ye may know then, I will go, and preserve the city, and will give up my life for this land. For it is a disgraceful thing, that those indeed who are free from the oracle, and are not concerned with any compulsion of the Gods, standing at their shields in battle, shall not be slow to die fighting before the towers for their country; and I, having betrayed my father, and my brother, and my own city, shall depart coward-like from out of the land; but wherever I live, I shall appear vile. No: by that Jove that dwelleth amidst the constellations, and sanguinary Mars, who set up those sown men, who erst sprung from the earth, to be kings of this country. But I will depart, and standing on the summit of the battlements, stabbing myself over the dark deep lair of the dragon, where the prophet appointed, will give liberty to the country—the word has been spoken. But I go, by my death about to give no mean gift to the state, and will rid this land of its affliction. For if every one, seizing what opportunity he had in his power of doing good, would persist in it, and bring it forward for his country's weal, states, experiencing fewer calamities, henceforward might be prosperous.\nCHOR. Thou camest forth, thou camest forth, O winged monster, production of the earth, and the viper of hell, the ravager of the Cadmeans, big with destruction, big with woes, in form half-virgin, a hostile prodigy, with thy ravening wings, and thy talons that preyed on raw flesh, who erst from Dirce's spot bearing aloft the youths, accompanied by an inharmonious lay, thou broughtest, thou broughtest cruel woes to our country; cruel was he of the Gods, whoever was the author of these things. And the moans of the matrons, and the moans of the virgins, resounded in the house, in a voice, in a strain of misery, they lamented some one thing, some another, in succession through the city. And the groaning and the noise was like to thunder, when the winged virgin bore out of sight any man from the city. But at length came by the mission of the Pythian oracle Œdipus the unhappy to this land of Thebes, to us then indeed delighted, but again came woes. For he, wretched man, having gained the glorious victory over the enigmas, contracts a marriage, an unfortunate marriage with his mother, and pollutes the city. And fresh woes does the unfortunate man cause to succeed with slaughter, devoting by curses his sons to the unhallowed contest.—With admiration, with admiration we look on him, who is gone to kill himself for the sake of his country's land; to Creon indeed having left lamentations, but about to make the seven-towered gates of the land greatly victorious. Thus may we be mothers, thus may we be blest in our children, O dear Pallas, who destroyedst the blood of the dragon by the hurled stone, driving the attention of Cadmus to the action, whence with rapine some fiend of the Gods rushed on this land.\nMESSENGER, JOCASTA, CHORUS.\nMESS. Ho there! who is at the gate of the palace? Open, conduct Jocasta from out of the house.—What ho! again—after a long time indeed, but yet come forth, hear, O renowned wife of Œdipus, ceasing from thy lamentations, and thy tears of grief.\nJOC. O most dear man, surely thou comest bearing the news of some calamity, of the death of Eteocles, by whose shield thou always didst go, warding off the weapons of the enemy. What new message, I pray, dost thou come to deliver? Is my son dead or alive? Tell me.\nMESS. He lives, be not alarmed for this, for I will rid thee of this fear.\nJOC. But what? In what state are our seven-towered ramparts?\nMESS. They stand unshaken, nor is the city destroyed.\nJOC. Come they in danger from the spear of Argos?\nMESS. To the very extreme of danger; but the arms of Thebes came off superior to the Mycenæan spear.\nJOC. Tell me one thing, by the Gods, whether thou knowest any thing of Polynices (since this is a concern to me also) whether he sees the light.\nMESS. Thus far in the day thy pair of children lives.\nJOC. Be thou blest. But how did ye stationed on the towers drive off the spear of Argos from the gates? Tell me, that I may go and delight the old blind man in the house with the news of his country's being preserved.\nMESS. After that the son of Creon, he that died for the land, standing on the summit of the towers, plunged the black-handled sword into his throat, the salvation of this land, thy son placed seven cohorts, and their leaders with them, at the seven gates, guards against the Argive spear; and he drew up the horse ready to support the horse, and the heavy-armed men to reinforce the shield-bearers, so that to the part of the wall which was in danger there might be succor at hand. But from the lofty citadel we view the army of the Argives with their white shields, having quitted Tumessus and now come near the trench, at full speed they reached the city of the land of Cadmus. And the pæan and the trumpets at the same time from them resounded, and off the walls from us. And first indeed Parthenopæus the son of the huntress (Atalanta) led his division horrent with their thick shields against the Neïtan[35] gate, having a family device in the middle of his shield, Atalanta destroying the Ætolian boar with her distant-wounding bow. And against the Prætan gate marched the prophet Amphiaraüs, having victims in his car, not bearing an insolent emblem, but modestly having his arms without a device. But against the Ogygian gate stood Prince Hippomedon, bearing an emblem in the middle of his shield, the Argus gazing with his spangled[36] eyes, [some eyes indeed with the rising of the stars awake,[37] and some with the setting closed, as we had the opportunity of seeing afterward when he was dead.] But Tydeus was drawn up at the Homoloïan gate, having on his shield a lion's skin rough with his mane, but in his right hand he bore a torch, as the Titan Prometheus,[38] intent on firing the city. But thy son Polynices drew up his array at the Crenean gate; but the swift Potnian mares, the emblem on his shield, were starting through fright, well circularly[39] grouped within the orb at the handle of the shield, so that they seemed infuriated. But Capaneus, not holding less notions than Mars on the approaching battle, drew up his division against the Electran gate. Upon the iron embossments of his shield was an earth-born giant bearing upon his shoulders a whole city, which he had torn up from the foundations with bars, an intimation to us what our city should suffer. But at the seventh gate was Adrastus, having his shield filled with a hundred vipers, bearing on his left arm a representation of the hydra, the boast of Argos, and from the midst of the walls the dragons were bearing the children of the Thebans in their jaws. But I had the opportunity of seeing each of these, as I took the word of battle to the leaders of the divisions. And first indeed we fought with bows, and javelins, and distant-wounding slings, and fragments of rocks; but when we were conquering in the fight, Tydeus shouted out, and thy son on a sudden, 'O sons of the Danaï, why delay we, ere we are galled with their missile weapons, to make a rush at the gates all in a body, light-armed men, horsemen, and those who drive the chariots?' And when they heard the cry, no one was backward; but many fell, their heads besmeared with blood; of us also you might have seen before the walls frequent divers toppling to the ground; and they moistened the parched earth with streams of blood. But the Arcadian, no Argive, the son of Atalanta, as some whirlwind falling on the gates, calls out for fire and a spade, as though he would dig up the city. But Periclymenus the son of the God of the Ocean stopped him in his raging, hurling at his head a stone, a wagon-load, a pinnacle[40] rent from the battlement; and dashed in pieces his head with its auburn hair, and crushed the suture of the bones, and besmeared with blood his lately blooming cheeks; nor shall he carry back his living form to his mother, glorious in her bow, the daughter of Mænalus. But when thy son saw this gate was in a state of safety, he went to another, and I followed. But I see Tydeus, and many armed with shields around him, darting with their Ætolian lances at the highest battlements of the towers, so that our men put to flight quitted the heights of the ramparts; but thy son, as a hunter, collects them together again; and posted them a second time on the towers; and we hasten on to another gate, having relieved the distress in this quarter. But Capaneus, how can I express the measure of his rage! For he came bearing the ranges of a long-reaching ladder, and made this high boast, 'That not even the hallowed fire of Jove should hinder him from taking the city from its highest turrets.' And these things soon as he had proclaimed, though assailed with stones, he clambered up, having contracted his body under his shield, climbing the slippery footing of the bars[41] of the ladder: but when he was now mounting the battlements of the walls Jupiter strikes him with his thunder; and the earth resounded, insomuch that all trembled; and his limbs were hurled, as it were by a sling, from the ladder separately from one another, his hair to heaven, and his blood to the ground, and his limbs, like the whirling of Ixion on his wheel, were carried round; and his scorched body falls to the earth. But when Adrastus saw that Jove was hostile to his army, he stationed the host of the Argives without the trench. But ours on the contrary, when they saw the auspicious sign from Jove, drove out their chariots, horsemen and heavy-armed, and rushing into the midst of the Argive arms engaged in fight: and there were all the sorts of misery together: they died, they fell from their chariots, and the wheels leaped up and axles upon axles: and corses were heaped together with corses.—We have preserved then our towers from being overthrown to this present day; but whether for the future this land will be prosperous, rests with the Gods.\nCHOR. To conquer is glorious; but if the Gods have the better intent, may I be fortunate!\nJOC. Well are the ways of the Gods, and of fortune; for my children live, and my country has escaped; but the unhappy Creon seems to feel the effects of my marriage, and of Œdipus's misfortunes, being deprived of his child; for the state indeed, happily, but individually, to his misery: but recount to me again, what after this did my two sons purpose to do?\nMESS. Forbear the rest; for in every circumstance hitherto thou art fortunate.\nJOC. This hast thou said so as to raise suspicion; I must not forbear.\nMESS. Dost thou want any thing more than that thy sons are safe?\nJOC. In what follows also I would hear if I am fortunate.\nMESS. Let me go: thy son is deprived of his armor-bearer.\nJOC. Thou concealest some ill and coverest it in obscurity.\nMESS. I can not speak thy ills after thy happiness.\nJOC. But thou shalt, unless fleeing from me thou fleest through the air.\nMESS. Alas! alas! Why dost thou not suffer me to depart after a message of glad tidings, but forcest me to tell calamities?—Thy sons are intent on most shameful deeds of boldness—to engage in single combat apart from the whole army, having addressed to the Argives and Thebans in common a speech, such as they never ought to have spoken. But Eteocles began, standing on the lofty turret, having commanded to proclaim silence to the army. And he said, 'O generals of the Grecian land, and chieftains of the Danaï, who have come hither, and O people of Cadmus, neither for the sake of Polynices barter your lives, nor for my cause. For I myself, taking this danger on myself, alone will enter the lists with my brother; and if indeed I slay him, I will dwell in the palace alone; but should I be subdued, I will give it up to him alone. But you, ceasing from the combat, O Argives, shall return to your land, not leaving your lives here; [of the Theban people also there is enough that lieth dead,'] Thus much he spake; but thy son Polynices rushed from the ranks, and approved his words. But all the Argives murmured their applause, and the people of Cadmus, as thinking this plan just. And after this the generals made a truce, and in the space between the two armies pledged an oath to abide by it. And now the two sons of the aged Œdipus clad their bodies in an entire suit of brazen armor. And their friends adorned them, the champion of this land indeed the chieftains of the Thebans; and him the principal men of the Danaï. And they stood resplendent, and they changed not their color, raging to let forth their spears at each other. But their friends on either side as they passed by encouraging them with words, thus spoke. 'Polynices, it rests with thee to erect the statue of Jove, emblem of victory, and to confer a glorious fame on Argos.' But to Eteocles on the other hand; 'Now thou fightest for the state, now if thou come off victorious, thou art in possession of the sceptre.' These things they said exhorting them to the combat. But the seers sacrificed the sheep, and scrutinized the shooting of the flames, and the bursting of the gall, the moisture adverse[42] to the fire, and the extremity of the flame, which bears a two-fold import, both the sign of victory,[43] and the sign of being defeated.[44] But if thou hast any power, or words of wisdom, or the soothing charms of incantation, go, stay thy children from the fearful combat, since great the danger, [and dreadful will be the sequel of the contest, namely, tears for thee, deprived this day of thy two children.]\nJOC. O my child, Antigone, come forth from before the palace; the state of thy fortune suits not now the dance, nor the virgin's chamber, but it is thy duty, in conjunction with thy mother, to hinder two excellent men, and thy brothers verging toward death from falling by each other's hands.\nANTIGONE, JOCASTA, CHORUS.\nANT. With what new horrors, O mother of my being, dost thou call out to thy friends before the house?\nJOC. O my daughter, the life of thy brothers is gone from them.\nANT. How sayest thou?\nJOC. They are drawn out in single combat.\nANT. Alas me! what wilt thou say, my mother?\nJOC. Nothing of pleasant import; but follow.\nANT. Whither? leaving my virgin chamber.\nJOC. To the army.\nANT. I am ashamed to go among the crowd.\nJOC. Thy present state admits not bashfulness.\nANT. But what shall I do then?\nJOC. Thou shalt quell the strife of the brothers.\nANT. Doing what, my mother.\nJOC. Falling before them with me.\nANT. Lead to the space between the armies; we must not delay.\nJOC. Haste, daughter, haste, since, if indeed I reach my sons before they engage, I still exist in heaven's fair light, but if they die, I shall lie dead with them.\nCHORUS.\nAlas! alas! shuddering with horror, shuddering is my breast; and through my flesh came pity, pity for the unhappy mother, on account of her two children, whether of them then will distain with blood the other (alas me for my sufferings, O Jove, O earth), the own brother's neck, the own brother's life, in arms, in slaughter? Wretched, wretched I, over which corse then shall I raise the lamentation for the dead? O earth, earth, the two beasts of prey, blood-thirsty souls, brandishing the spear, will quickly distain with blood the fallen, fallen enemy. Wretches, that they ever came to the thought of a single combat! In a foreign strain will I mourn with tears my elegy of groans due to the dead. Destiny is at hand—death is near; this day will decide the event. Ill-fated, ill-fated murder because of the Furies! But I see Creon here with clouded brow advancing toward the house, I will cease therefore from the groans I am uttering.\nCREON, CHORUS.\nCRE. Ah me! what shall I do? whether am I to groan in weeping myself, or the city, which a cloud of such magnitude encircles as to cast us amidst the gloom of Acheron? For my son has perished having died for the city, having achieved a glorious name, but to me a name of sorrow. Him having taken just now from the dragon's den, stabbed by his own hand, I wretched bore in my arms; and the whole house resounds with shrieks; but I, myself aged, am come after my aged sister Jocasta, that she may wash and lay out my son now no more. For it behooves the living well to revere the God below by paying honors to the dead.\nCHOR. Thy sister is gone out of the house, O Creon, and the girl Antigone attending the steps of her mother.\nCRE. Whither? and for what hap? tell me.\nCHOR. She heard that her sons were about to come to a contest in single battle for the royal palace.\nCRE. How sayest thou? whilst I was fondly attending to my son's corse, I arrived not so far in knowledge, as to be acquainted with this also.\nCHOR. But thy sister has indeed been gone some time; but I think, O Creon, that the contest, in which their lives are at stake, has already been concluded by the sons of Œdipus.\nCRE. Ah me! I see indeed this signal, the downcast eye and countenance of the approaching messenger, who will relate every thing that has taken place.\nMESSENGER, CREON, CHORUS.\nMESS. O wretched me! what language or what words can I utter? we are undone—\nCRE. Thou beginnest thy speech with no promising prelude.\nMESS. Oh wretched me! doubly do I lament, for I hear great calamities.\nCRE. In addition to the calamities that have happened dost thou still speak of others?\nMESS. Thy sister's sons, O Creon, no longer behold the light.\nCRE. Ah! alas! thou utterest great ills to me and to the state.\nMESS. O mansions of Œdipus, do ye hear these things of thy children who have perished by similar fates?\nCHOR. Ay, so that, had they but sense, they would weep.\nCRE. O most heavy misery! Oh me wretched with woes! alas! unhappy me!\nMESS. If that thou knewest the evils yet in addition to these.\nCRE. And how can there be more fatal ills than these?\nMESS. Thy sister is dead with her two children.\nCHOR. Raise, raise the cry of woe, and smite your heads with the blows of your white hands.\nCRE. Oh unhappy Jocasta, what an end of thy life and of thy marriage hast thou endured in the riddles of the Sphinx![45] But how took place the slaughter of her two sons, and the combat arising from the curse of Œdipus? tell me.\nMESS. The success of the country before the towers indeed thou knowest; for the circuit of the wall is not of such vast extent, but that thou must know all that has taken place. But after that the sons of the aged Œdipus had clad their limbs in brazen armor, they came and stood in the midst of the plain between the two armies, ready for the contest, and the fierceness of the single battle. And having cast a look toward Argos, Polynices uttered his prayer; 'O venerable Juno (for I am thine, since in marriage I joined myself with the daughter of Adrastus, and dwell in that land), grant me to slay my brother, and to cover with blood my hostile hand bearing the victory.' And Eteocles looking at the temple of Pallas, glorious in her golden shield, prayed; 'O Daughter of Jove, grant me with my hand to hurl my victorious spear from this arm home to the breast of my brother, [and slay him who came to lay waste my country.'] And when the sound of the Tuscan trumpet was raised, as the torch, the signal for the fierce battle, they sped with dreadful rush toward each other; and like wild boars whetting their savage tusks, they met, their cheeks all moist with foam; and they rushed forward with their lances; but they couched beneath the orbs of their shields, in order that the steel might fall harmless. But if either perceived the other's eye raised above the verge, he drove the lance at his face, intent to be beforehand with him: but dexterously they shifted their eyes to the open ornaments of their shields, so that the spear was made of none effect. And more sweat trickled down the spectators than the combatants, through the fear of their friends. But Eteocles, stumbling with his foot against a stone, which rolled under his tread,[46] places his limb without the shield. But Polynices ran up with his spear, when he saw a stroke open to his steel, and the Argive spear passed through the shank. And all the host of the Danaï shouted for joy. And the hero who first was wounded, when he perceived his shoulder exposed in this effort, pierced the breast of Polynices with his lance, and gave joy to the citizens of Cadmus, but he broke the point of his spear. But being come to a strait for a spear, he retreated backward on his leg, and taking a stone of marble, he hurled it and crashed his antagonist's spear in the middle: and the battle was on equal terms, both being deprived of the spear in their hands. Then seizing the handles of their swords they met at close quarters, and, as they clashed their shields together, raised a great tumult of battle around them. And Eteocles having a sort of idea of its success, made use of a Thessalian stratagem, which he had learned from his connection with that country. For giving up his present mode of attack, he brings his left foot behind, protecting well the pit of his own stomach; and stepping forward his right leg, he plunged the sword through the navel, and drove it to the vertebræ. But the unhappy Polynices bending together his side and his bowels falls weltering in blood. But the other, as he were now the victor, and had subdued him in the fight, casting his sword on the ground, went to spoil him, not fixing his attention on himself, but on that his purpose. Which thing also deceived him; for Polynices, he that fell first, still breathing a little, preserving his sword e'en in his deathly fall, with difficulty indeed, but he did stretch his sword to the heart of Eteocles. And holding the dust in their gripe they both fall near one another, and determined not the victory.\nCHOR. Alas! alas! to what degree, O Œdipus, do I groan for thy misfortunes! but the God seems to have fulfilled thy imprecations.\nMESS. Hear now then woes even in addition to these—For when her sons having fallen were breathing their last, at this moment the wretched mother rushes before them, and when she perceived them stricken with mortal wounds she shrieked out, 'Oh my sons, I am come too late a succor:' and throwing herself by the side of her children in turn, she wept, she lamented with moans her long anxiety in suckling them now lost: and their sister, who accompanied to stand by her in her misery, at the same time broke forth; 'O supporters of my mother's age! Oh ye that have betrayed my hopes of marriage, my dearest brothers!'—But king Eteocles heaving from his breast his gasping breath, heard his mother, and putting out his cold clammy hand, sent not forth indeed a voice; but from his eyes spoke her in tears to signify affection. But Polynices, who yet breathed, looking at his sister and his aged mother, thus spoke: 'We perish, O my mother; but I grieve for thee, and for this my sister, and my brother who lies dead, for being my friend, he became my enemy, but still my friend.—But bury me, O mother of my being, and thou my sister, in my native land, and pacify the exasperated city, that I may obtain thus much at least of my country's land, although I have lost the palace. And close my eyelids with thy hand, my mother' (and he places it himself upon his eyes), 'and fare ye well! for now darkness surroundeth me.' And both breathed out their lives together. And the mother, when she saw what had taken place, beyond endurance grieving, snatched the sword from the dead body, and perpetrated a deed of horror; for she drove the steel through the middle of her throat, and lies dead on those most dear to her, having each in her arms embraced. But the people rose up hastily to a strife of opinions; we indeed, as holding, that my master was victorious; but they, that the other was; and there was also a contention between the generals, those on the other side contended, that Polynices first struck with the spear, but those on ours that there was no victory where the combatants died. [And in the mean time Antigone withdrew from the army;] but they rushed to arms; but fortunately by a sort of foresight the people of Cadmus had sat upon their shields: and we gained the advantage of falling on the Argives not yet accoutred in their arms. And no one made a stand, but flying they covered the plain; and immense quantities of blood were spilt of the corses that fell, but when we were victorious in the fight, some indeed raised the image of Jove emblem of victory, but some of us stripping the shields from the Argive corses sent the spoils within the city. But others with Antigone are bearing hither the dead for their friends to lament over. But these contests have in some respect turned out most happy for this state, but in other respect most unhappy.\nCHOR. No longer the misfortunes of the house come to our ears, we may also see before the palace these three fallen corses, who have shared the dark realms by a united death.\n[The dead bodies borne.]\nANTIGONE, CREON, CHORUS.\nANT. Not veiling the softness of my cheek on which my ringlets fall, nor caring for the purple glow of virginity under my lids, the blush of my countenance, I am borne along the bacchanal of the dead, rending the fillet from my hair, rejecting the saffron robe of delicateness, having the mournful office of conducting the dead. Alas! alas! woe is me! Oh Polynices, thou well answeredst to thy name! Alas me! Oh Thebes! but thy strife, no strife, but murder consummated with murder,[47] hath destroyed the house of Œdipus with dreadful, with mournful blood. But what groan responsive to my sufferings, or what lament of music shall I invoke to my tears, to my tears, O house, O house, bearing these three kindred bodies, my mother, and her children, the joy of the fury? who destroyed the entire house of Œdipus, what time intelligently[48] he unfolded the difficult song of the fierce monster, having thereby slain the body of the fierce musical Sphinx. Alas me! my father; what Grecian, or what Barbarian, or what other of the noble in birth, of mortal blood, in time of old ever bore such manifest sufferings of so many ills? Wretched I, how do I lament! What bird, sitting on the highest boughs of the oak or pine, will sing responsive to my lamentations, who have lost my mother? who weep the strain of grief in addition to these moans for my brothers, about to pass my long life in floods of tears.—Which shall I bewail? On which first shall I scatter the first offerings rent from my hair? On my mother's two breasts of milk, or upon the death-wounds of my two brothers? Alas! alas! Leave thine house, bringing thy sightless eye, O aged father, Œdipus, show thy wretched age, who within thy palace having poured the gloomy darkness over thine eyes, draggest on a long[49] life. Dost thou hear wandering in the hall,—resting thy aged foot upon the couch in a state of misery?\nŒDIPUS, CREON, ANTIGONE, CHORUS.\nŒD. Why, O virgin, hast thou with the most doleful tears called me forth leaning on the support of a blind foot[50] to the light, a bed-ridden man from his darksome chamber, gray-headed, an obscure phantom of air—a dead body beneath the earth—a flitting dream?\nANT. O father, thou shalt receive words of unhappy tidings; no longer do thy children behold the light, nor thy wife, who ever was employed in attending as a staff on thy blind foot, my father: alas me!\nŒD. Alas me, for my sufferings! for well may I groan and vociferate these things. The three souls, tell me, my child, by what fate, how quitted they this light?\nANT. Not for the sake of reproaching thee, nor exulting over thee, but for grief I speak: thy evil genius, heavy with swords, and fire, and wretched combats, has rushed down upon thy children, O my father.\nŒD. Alas me! ah! ah!\nANT. Why dost thou thus groan?\nŒD. Alas me! my children!\nANT. Thou wouldest grieve indeed, if looking on the chariot of the sun drawn by its four steeds, thou couldest direct the sight of thine eyes to these bodies of the dead.\nŒD. The evil of my sons indeed is manifest; but my wretched wife, by what fate, O my child, did she perish?\nANT. Causing to all tears of grief they could not contain, to her children she bared her breast, a suppliant she bared it, holding it up in supplication. But the mother found her children at the Electran gate, in the mead where the lotus abounds, contending with their lances in the common war, as lions bred in the same cave, with the blood-wounds now a cold, a gory libation, which Plato received, and Mars gave. And having seized the brazen-wrought sword from the dead she plunged it into her flesh, but with grief for her children she fell amidst her children. But all these sufferings, O my father, has the God heaped this day upon our house, whoever he be, that adds this consummation.\nCHOR. This day hath been the beginning of many woes to the house of Œdipus; but may life be more fortunate!\nCRE. Now indeed cease from your grief, for it is time to think of the sepulture. But hear these words, O Œdipus; Eteocles, thy son, hath given to me the dominion of this land, giving them as a marriage portion to Hæmon, and with them the bed of thy daughter Antigone. I therefore will not suffer thee any longer to dwell in this land. For clearly did Tiresias say, that never, whilst thou dost inhabit this land, will the state be prosperous. But depart; and this I say not from insolence, nor being thine enemy, but on account of thy evil genius, fearing lest the country suffer any harm.\nŒD. O Fate, from the beginning how wretched [and unhappy] didst thou form me, [if ever other man was formed!] whom, even before I came into the light from my mother's womb, when yet unborn Apollo foretold that I should be the murderer of my father Laïus, alas! wretch that I am! And when I was born, again my father who gave me life, seeks to take my life, considering that I was born his enemy: for it was fated that he should die by my hands, and he sends me, poor wretch, as I craved the breast, a prey for the wild beasts: where I was preserved—for would that Cithæron, it ought, had sunk to the bottomless chasms of Tartarus, for that it did not destroy me; but the God fixed it my lot to serve under Polybus my master: but I unhappy man, having slain my own father, ascended the bed of my wretched mother, and begat children, my brothers, whom I destroyed, having received down the curse from Laïus, and given it to my sons. For I was not by nature so utterly devoid of understanding, as to have devised such things against my eyes, and against the life of my children, without the interference of some of the Gods. Well!—what then shall I ill-fated do? who will accompany me the guide of my dark steps? She that lies here dead! living, well know I, she would. But my noble pair of sons? I have no sons.—But still in my vigor can I myself procure my sustenance? Whence?—Why, O Creon, dost thou thus utterly kill me? for kill me thou wilt, if thou shalt cast me out of the land. Yet will I not appear base, stretching my hands around thy knees, for I can not belie my former nobleness, not even though my plight is miserable.\nCRE. Well has it been spoken by thee, that thou wilt not touch my knees, but I can not permit thee to dwell in the land. But of these corses, the one we must even now bear to the house; but the body of Polynices cast out unburied beyond the borders of this land. And these things shall be proclaimed to all the Thebans: 'whoever shall be found either crowning the corse, or covering it with earth, shall receive death for his offense.' But thou, ceasing from the groans for the three dead, retire, Antigone, within the house, and behave as beseems a virgin, expecting the approaching day in which the bed of Hæmon awaits thee.\nANT. Oh father, in what a state of woes do we miserable beings lie! How do I lament for thee! more than for the dead! For it is not that one of thy ills is heavy, and the other not heavy, but thou art in all things unhappy, my father.—But thee I ask, our new lord, [wherefore dost thou insult my father here, banishing him from his country?] Why make thy laws against an unhappy corse?\nCRE. The determination of Eteocles this, not mine.\nANT. It is absurd, and thou a fool to enforce it.\nCRE. How so? Is it not just to execute injunctions?\nANT. No, if they are base, at least, and spoken with ill intent.\nCRE. What! will he not with justice be given to the dogs?\nANT. No, for thus do ye not demand of him lawful justice.\nCRE. We do; since he was the enemy of the state, who least ought to be an enemy.\nANT. Hath he not paid then his life to fortune?\nCRE. And in his burial too let him now satisfy vengeance.\nANT. What outrage having committed, if he came after his share of the kingdom?\nCRE. This man, that you may know once for all, shall be unburied.\nANT. I will bury him; even though the city forbid it.\nCRE. Thyself then wilt thou at the same time bury near the corse.\nANT. But that is a glorious thing, for two friends to lie near.\nCRE. Lay hold of her, and bear her to the house.\nANT. By no means—for I will not let go this body.\nCRE. The God has decreed it, O virgin, not as thou wilt.\nANT. And this too is decreed—that the dead be not insulted.\nCRE. Around him none shall place the moist dust.\nANT. Nay, by his mother here Jocasta, I entreat thee, Creon.\nCRE. Thou laborest in vain, for thou canst not obtain this.\nANT. But suffer thou me at any rate to bathe the body.\nCRE. This would be one of the things forbidden by the state.\nANT. But let me put bandages round his cruel wounds.\nCRE. In no way shalt thou show respect to this corse.\nANT. Oh most dear, but I will at least kiss thy lips.\nCRE. Thou shalt not prepare calamity against thy wedding by thy lamentations.\nANT. What! while I live shall I ever marry thy son?\nCRE. There is strong necessity for thee, for by what means wilt thou escape the marriage?\nANT. That night then shall find me one of the Danaïdæ.\nCRE. Dost mark with what audacity she hath insulted us?\nANT. The steel be witness, and the sword, by which I swear.\nCRE. But why art thou so eager to get rid of this marriage?\nANT. I will take my flight with my most wretched father here.\nCRE. There is nobleness in thee; but there is some degree of folly.\nANT. And I will die with him too, that thou mayest farther know.\nCRE. Go—thou shalt not slay my son—quit the land.\nŒDIPUS, ANTIGONE, CHORUS.\nŒD. O daughter, I praise thee indeed for thy zealous intentions.\nANT. But if I were to marry, and thou suffer banishment alone, my father?\nŒD. Stay and be happy; I will bear with content mine own ills.\nANT. And who will minister to thee, blind as thou art, my father?\nŒD. Falling wherever it shall be my fate, I will lie on the ground.\nANT. But Œdipus, where is he? and the renowned Enigmas?\nŒD. Perished! one day blest me, and one day destroyed.\nANT. Ought not I then to have a share in thy woes?\nŒD. To a daughter exile with a blind father is shameful.\nANT. Not to a right-minded one however, but honorable, my father.\nŒD. Lead me now onward, that I may touch thy mother.\nANT. There: touch the aged woman with thy most dear hand.\nŒD. O mother! Oh most hapless wife!\nANT. She doth lie miserable, having all ills at once on her.\nŒD. But where is the fallen body of Eteocles, and of Polynices?\nANT. They lie extended before thee near one another.\nŒD. Place my blind hand upon their unhappy faces.\nANT. There: touch thy dead children with thy hand.\nŒD. O ye dear wrecks, unhappy, of an unhappy father.\nANT. O name of Polynices, most dear indeed to me.\nŒD. Now, my child, is the oracle of Apollo come to pass.\nANT. What? but dost thou mention evils in addition to these evils?\nŒD. That I must die an exile at Athens.\nANT. Where? what citadel of Attica will receive thee?\nŒD. The sacred Colonus, and the temple of the Equestrian God. But stay—minister to thy blind father here, since thou art desirous of sharing his exile.\nANT. Go to thy wretched banishment: stretch forth thy dear hand, O aged father, having me as thy guide, as the gale that wafts the ship.\nŒD. Behold, I go, my child, be thou my unhappy conductor.\nANT. We are, we are indeed unhappy above all Theban virgins.\nŒD. Where shall I place my aged footstep? Bring my staff, my child.\nANT. This way, this way come; here, here place thy foot, thou that hast the strength of a dream.\nŒD. Alas! alas! for my most wretched flight!—To drive me, old as I am, from my country—Alas! alas! the dreadful, dreadful things that I have suffered!\nANT. What suffered! what suffered![51] Vengeance sees not the wicked, nor repays the foolishness of mortals.\nŒD. That man am I, who mounted aloft to the victorious heavenly song, having solved the dark enigma of the virgin Sphinx.\nANT. Dost thou bring up again the glory of the Sphinx? Forbear from speaking of thy former successes. These wretched sufferings awaited thee, O father, being an exile from thy country to die any where. Leaving with my dear virgins tears for my loss, I depart far from my country, wandering in state not like a virgin's.\nŒD. Oh! the excellency of thy mind!\nANT. In the calamities of a father at least it will make me glorious. Wretched am I, on account of the insults offered to thee and to my brother, who has perished from the family, a corse denied sepulture, unhappy, whom, even if I must die, my father, I will cover with secret earth.\nŒD. Go, show thyself to thy companions.\nANT. They have enough of my lamentations.\nŒD. But make thy supplications at the altars.\nANT. They have a satiety of my woes.\nŒD. Go then, where stands the fane of Bacchus unapproached, on the mountains of the Mænades.\nANT. To whom I formerly, clad in the skin of the Theban fawn, danced the sacred step of Semele on the mountains, conferring a thankless favor on the Gods?\nŒD. O ye inhabitants of my illustrious country, behold, I, this Œdipus, who alone stayed the violence of the bloodthirsty Sphinx, now, dishonored, forsaken, miserable, am banished from the land. Yet why do I bewail these things, and lament in vain? For the necessity of fate proceeding from the Gods a mortal must endure.\nCRE. [O greatly glorious Victory, mayest thou uphold my life, and cease not from crowning me!]",

Welcome, friend, with all thy tale of fear!\nIt shows they mean to fly: they mean to clear\n[Pg 6    vv. 55-78]\nDecks in the dark and so delude my sight . . .\nI like that beacon-burning in the night.\nO Zeus above, who checked my conquering way,\nWho baulked the hungry lion of his prey\nOr ever I could sweep my country clear\nOf these despoilers, dost thou hate my spear?\nHad but the sun's bright arrows failed me not,\nI ne'er had rested till the ships were hot\nWith fire, and through the tents upon the plain\nThis bloody hand had passed and passed again!\nMyself, I longed to try the battle-cast\nBy night, and use God's vantage to the last,\nBut sage and prophet, learned in the way\nOf seercraft, bade me wait for dawn of day,\nAnd then—leave no Greek living in the land.\nThey wait not, they, for what my prophets planned\nSo sagely. In the dark a runaway\nBeats a pursuer.\nThrough our whole array\nSend runners! Bid them shake off sleep and wait\nReady with shield and spear. 'Tis not too late\nTo catch them as they climb on board, and slash\nTheir crouching shoulders till the gangways splash\nWith blood, or teach them, fettered leg and arm,\nTo dig the stiff clods of some Trojan farm.\nLeader.\nMy Prince, thy words run fast. Nor thou nor I\nHave knowledge yet that the Greeks mean to fly.\nHector.\nWhat makes them light their beacons? Tell me, what?\n[Pg 7    vv. 79-90]Leader.\nGod knows! And, for my part, I like it not.\nHector.\nGod knows! And, for my part, I like it not.\nLeader.\nGod knows! And, for my part, I like it not.\nHector.\nThey never fled, man, in such wild dismay.\nLeader (yielding).\n'Twas all thy work.—Judge thou, and we obey.\nHector.\nMy word is simple. Arm and face the foe.\n[A sound of marching without.\nLeader.\nWho comes? Aeneas, and in haste, as though\nFraught with some sudden tiding of the night.\nEnter Aeneas.\nAeneas.\nHector, what means it? Watchers in affright\nWho gather shouting at thy doors, and then\nHold midnight council, shaking all our men?\nHector.\nTo arms, Aeneas! Arm from head to heel!\n[Pg 8    vv. 91-109]Aeneas.\nWhat is it? Tidings? Doth the Argive steal\nSome march, some ambush in the day's eclipse?\nHector.\n'Tis flight, man! They are marching to the ships.\nAeneas.\nHow know'st thou?—Have we proof that it is flight?\nHector.\nThey are burning beacon-fires the livelong night.\nThey never mean to wait till dawn. Behind\nThat screen of light they are climbing in the blind\nDark to their ships—unmooring from our coast.\nAeneas (looking toward the distant fires: after a pause).\nGod guide them!—Why then do you arm the host?\nHector.\nI mean to lame them in their climbing, I\nAnd my good spear, and break them as they fly.\nBlack shame it were, and folly worse than shame,\nTo let these spoilers go the road they came\nUnpunished, when God gives them to us here.\nAeneas.\nBrother, I would thy wit were like thy spear!\nBut Nature wills not one man should be wise\nIn all things; each must seek his separate prize.\nAnd thine is battle pure. There comes this word\n[Pg 9    vv. 110-136]\nOf beacons, on the touch thy soul is stirred:\n'They fly! Out horse and chariots!'—Out withal\nPast stake and trench, while night hangs like a pall!\nSay, when we cross that coiling depth of dyke,\nWe find the foe not fled, but turned to strike;\nOne check there, and all hope of good return\nIs gone. How can our men, returning, learn\nThe tricks of the palisade? The chariots how\nKeep to the bridges on the trenches' brow,\nSave with jammed wheels and broken axles? Aye,\nAnd say thou conquer: other wars yet lie\nBefore thee. Peleus' son, for all his ire,\nWill never let thee touch the ships with fire\nOr pounce on his Greek lambs. The man will bide\nNo wrong and standeth on a tower of pride.\nNay, brother, let the army, head on shield,\nSleep off its long day's labour in the field:\nThen, send a spy; find someone who will dare\nCreep to yon Argive camp. Then, if 'tis clear\nThey mean flight, on and smite them as they fly.\nElse, if the beacons hide some strategy,\nThe spy will read it out, and we can call\nA council.—Thus speak I, my general.\nChorus.                 [Strophe.\n'Tis good! 'Tis wisdom! Prince, give heed\nAnd change the word thy passion gave.\nNo soldier loveth, in his need,\nThe glory of a chief too brave.\nA spy is best: a spy, to learn\nFor what strange work those beacons burn\nAll night beside the guarded wave.\n[Pg 10     vv. 137-157]Hector.\nYe all so wish it?—Well, ye conquer me.\n(To Aeneas) Go thou and calm the allies. There will be\nSome stir among them, hearing of these high\nAnd midnight councils.—I will seek the spy\nTo send to the Greek camp. If there we learn\nOf some plot hatching, on the man's return\nI straight will call thee and share counsels. So.\nBut wait attentive. If he says they go\nShipward and plan to escape, one trumpet call\nShall warn thee, and I wait no more, but fall\nOn camp and hulls, or ever dawn can rise.\nAeneas.\nAye, haste and send him. Now thy plans are wise,\nAnd when need comes I am with thee, sword by sword.\n[Exit Aeneas.\nHector (turning to the Guards and other soldiers).\nYe gathered Trojans, sharers of my word,\nWho dares to creep through the Greek lines alone?\nWho will so help his fatherland?\nDoth none\nOffer? Must I do everything, one hand\nAlone, to save our allies and our land?\n[A lean dark man pushes forward from the back.\nDolon.\nI, Prince!—I offer for our City's sake\nTo go disguised to the Greek ships, to make\nTheir counsels mine, and here bring word to thee.\nIf that be thy full service, I agree.\n[Pg 11     vv. 158-171]Hector.\nDolon the Wolf! A wise wolf and a true!\nThy father's house was praised when first I knew\nTroy: this shall raise it twofold in our eyes.\nDolon.\n'Tis wise to do good work, but also wise\nTo pay the worker. Aye, and fair reward\nMakes twofold pleasure, though the work be hard.\nHector.\nSo be it: an honest rule. Do thou lay down\nWhat guerdon likes thee best—short of my crown.\nDolon.\nI care not for thy crowned and care-fraught life.\nHector.\nWouldst have a daughter of the King to wife?\nDolon.\nI seek no mate that might look down on me.\nHector.\nGood gold is ready, if that tempteth thee.\nDolon.\nWe live at ease and have no care for gold.\nHector.\nWell, Troy hath other treasures manifold.\n[Pg 12     vv. 172-183]Dolon.\nPay me not now, but when the Greeks are ta'en.\nHector.\nThe Greeks! . . .

Undying was the breed thereof,\nAnd these shall never die, who bear to war\nGreat Peleus' son, swift gleaming like a star.\nPoseidon, rider of the wild sea-drift,\nTamed them, men say, and gave them for his gift\nTo Peleus.—None the less, since I have stirred\nHopes, I will baulk them not. I pledge my word,\nAchilles' steeds, a rare prize, shall be thine.\nDolon.\nI thank thee.—'Tis indeed a prize more fine\nThan all in Troy.—Grudge me not that; there be\nGuerdons abundant for a Prince like thee.\n[Exit Hector.\nChorus.

The Guards gather round him, bidding him godspeed as he crawls off in the dark towards the Greek camp.

The Guards seeing him return to their places.\nShepherd.\nHo, Master!\n[Enter Hector from tent.\nI would it ofttimes were my luck to share\nAs goodly news with thee as now I bear.\nHector.\nWhat dulness hangs about these shepherds!

How do his name and lineage run?\nShepherd.\nHe comes from Thrace, the River Strymon's son.\nHector.\nRhesus! Not Rhesus, here on Trojan soil?\nShepherd.\nThou hast guessed. That eases me of half my toil.\nHector.\nWhat makes he there towards Ida? All astray\nThus from the plain and the broad waggon-way!\nShepherd.\nI know not rightly, though one well may guess.\n'Tis hard to land at night, with such a press\nOf spears, on a strange coast, where rumours tell\nOf foes through all the plain-land. We that dwell\nOn Ida, in the rock, Troy's ancient root\n[Pg 18     vv. 289-316]\nAnd hearth-stone, were well frighted, through the mute\nAnd wolfish thickets thus to hear him break.\nA great and rushing noise those Thracians make,\nMarching. We, all astonied, ran to drive\nOur sheep to the upmost heights. 'Twas some Argive,\nWe thought, who came to sweep the mountain clear\nAnd waste thy folds; till suddenly our ear\nCaught at their speech, and knew 'twas nothing Greek.\nThen all our terror fled. I ran to seek\nSome scout or pioneer who led the van\nAnd called in Thracian: 'Ho, what child of man\nDoth lead you? From what nation do ye bring\nThis host with aid to Ilion and her king?'\nHe told me what I sought, and there I stood\nWatching; and saw one gleaming like a God,\nTall in the darkness on a Thracian car.\nA plate of red gold mated, like a bar,\nHis coursers' necks, white, white as fallen snow.\nA carven targe, with golden shapes aglow,\nHung o'er his back. Before each courser's head\nA Gorgon, to the frontlet riveted,\nWith bells set round—like stories that they tell\nOf Pallas' shield—made music terrible.\nThe numbers of that host no pen could write\nNor reckon; 'tis a multitudinous sight,\nLong lines of horsemen, lines of targeteers,\nArchers abundant; and behind them veers\nA wavering horde, light-armed, in Thracian weed.\nA friend is come to Ilion in her need\n'Gainst whom no Argive, let him fly or stand,\nShall aught avail nor 'scape his conquering hand.\n[Pg 19     vv. 317-331]Leader.\nLo, when the Gods breathe gently o'er a town,\nAll runs to good, as water-streams run down.\nHector (bitterly).\nAye, when my spear hath fortune, when God sends\nHis favour, I shall find abundant friends.\nI need them not; who never came of yore\nTo help us, when we rolled to death before\nThe war-swell, and the wind had ripped our sail.\nThen Rhesus taught us Trojans what avail\nHis words are.—He comes early to the feast;\nWhere was he when the hunters met the beast?\nWhere, when we sank beneath the Argive spear?\nLeader.\nWell may'st thou mock and blame thy friend. Yet here\nHe comes with help for Troy. Accept him thou.\nHector.\nWe are enough, who have held the wall till now.\nLeader.\nMaster, dost think already that our foe\nIs ta'en?\nHector.\nI do.

With all these panoplies\nOf gold that filled our Shepherd's heart with joy,\nBid Rhesus welcome, as war-friend to Troy.\n[Exit Shepherd; Hector returns to his tent, amid the joy of the soldiers.\nChorus.\nNow Adrasteia be near and guard\nOur lips from sin, lest the end be hard!\nBut he cometh, he cometh, the Child of the River!\nThe pride of my heart it shall roll unbarred.\n[Pg 21     vv. 346-378]\nWe craved thy coming; yea, need was strong\nIn the Hall of thy lovers, O child of Song;\nThy mother the Muse and her fair-bridged River\nThey held thee from us so long, so long!\nBy Strymon's torrent alone she sang,\nAnd Strymon shivered and coiled and sprang;\nAnd her arms went wide to the wild sweet water,\nAnd the love of the River around her rang.\nWe hail thee, Fruit of the River's seed,\nYoung Zeus of the Dawn, on thy starry steed!\nO ancient City, O Ida's daughter,\nIs God the Deliverer found indeed?\nAnd men shall tell of thee, Ilion mine,\nOnce more a-harping at day's decline,\n'Mid laughing of lovers and lays and dances\nAnd challenge on challenge of circling wine?\nWhen the Greek is smitten that day shall be,\nAnd fled to Argolis over the sea:\nO mighty of hand, O leader of lances,\nSmite him, and heaven be good to thee!\nThou Rider golden and swift and sheer,\nAchilles falters: appear! appear!\nThe car like flame where the red shield leapeth,\nThe fell white steeds and the burning spear!\nNo Greek shall boast he hath seen thy face\nAnd danced again in the dancing place;\nAnd the land shall laugh for the sheaves she reapeth,\nOf spoilers dead by a sword from Thrace.\n[Pg 22     vv. 379-395]\nEnter Rhesus in dazzling white armour, followed by his Charioteer and Attendants.

A whelp indeed\nIs born in Thracia's lion fold,\nWhose leap shall make strong cities bleed.\nBehold his body girt with gold,\nAnd hark the pride of bells along\nThe frontlet of that targe's hold.\nChorus.\nA God, O Troy, a God and more!\n'Tis Ares' self, this issue strong\nOf Strymon and the Muse of song,\nWhose breath is fragrant on thy shore!\nRe-enter Hector.\nRhesus.\nLord Hector, Prince of Ilion, noble son\nOf noble sires, all hail! Long years have run\nSince last we greeted, and 'tis joy this day\nTo see thy fortunes firm and thine array\nCamped at the foe's gate. Here am I to tame\nThat foe for thee, and wrap his ships in flame.\nHector.\nThou child of Music and the Thracian flood,\nStrymonian Rhesus, truth is alway good\nIn Hector's eyes. I wear no double heart.\n[Pg 23     vv. 396-421]\nLong, long ago thou shouldst have borne thy part\nIn Ilion's labours, not have left us here,\nFor all thy help, to sink beneath the spear.\nWhy didst thou—not for lack of need made plain!—\nNot come, not send, not think of us again?\nWhat grave ambassadors prayed not before\nThy throne, what herald knelt not at thy door?\nWhat pride of gifts did Troy not send to thee?\nAnd thou, a lord of Barbary even as we,\nThou, brother of our blood, like one at sup\nWho quaffs his fill and flings away the cup,\nHast flung to the Greeks my city! Yet, long since,\n'Twas I that found thee but a little prince\nAnd made thee mighty, I and this right hand;\nWhen round Pangaion and the Paiôn's land,\nFront against front, I burst upon the brood\nOf Thrace and broke their targes, and subdued\nTheir power to thine. The grace whereof, not small,\nThou hast spurned, and when thy kinsmen, drowning, call,\nComest too late. Thou! Others there have been\nThese long years, not by nature of our kin . . .\nSome under yon rough barrows thou canst see\nLie buried; they were true to Troy and me;\nAnd others, yet here in the shielded line\nOr mid the chariots, parching in the shine\nOf noonday, starving in the winds that bite\nThrough Ilion's winter, still endure and fight\nOn at my side. 'Twas not their way, to lie\nOn a soft couch and, while the cups go by,\nPledge my good health, like thee, in Thracian wine.\nI speak as a free man. With thee and thine\nHector is wroth, and tells thee to thy face.\n[Pg 24     vv. 422-448]Rhesus.\nThy way is mine, friend. Straight I run my race\nIn word and deed, and bear no double tongue.\nI tell thee, more than thine my heart was wrung,\nYea, angered past all durance, thus to stay\nBack from thy battles. 'Twas a folk that lay\nHard on my borders, Scythians of the north;\nJust when my host for Troy had started forth,\nThey fell upon our homes. I had reached the coast\nOf the Friendless Sea and purposed to have crossed\nMy Thracians there. We turned; and all that plain\nIs trampled in a mire of Scythian slain\nPloughed by our spears, and blood of Thrace withal\nNot stinted. This it was that drowned thy call\nFor help and held me back from Ilion's need.\nI broke their power; the princes of their breed\nI took to hostage, made their elders swear\nTo bring my house due tribute, year by year,\nThen, never lagging, crossed the Pontus mouth,\nMarched by long stages through Bithynia south\nAnd here am come . . . not drunken with the feast,\nAs thou wouldst have me be, not lulled to rest\nIn golden chambers. In this harness hard\nI have borne my nights of winter storm that starred\nThe Euxine into ice and scared the strong\nPaionians.\nLong I have been, but not too long\nTo save thee yet. Friend, this is the tenth year\nThou labourest on unceasing, with no clear\nVantage; day creeps by day, and Ares throws\nThe same red dice for thee and for thy foes.\nNow, hear my vow. Before one day's eclipse\nI swear to break their wall, to burn their ships\n[Pg 25     vv. 449-473]\nAnd slay their princes. On the second day\nI leave this soil and take my homeward way,\nThy pains relieved. No Trojan of the land\nNeed move, nor turn the buckler in his hand.\nAlone my late-comers will turn the tide\nAnd smite your Greeks, for all their bitter pride.\nChorus.\n[The Trojan soldiers, who have been listening with delight, here break out in irrepressible applause.\nAll hail!\nSweet words and faithful heart!\nOnly may Zeus avert\nFrom those proud lips the Wrath that none may bear!\nNever a galleon bore,\nNow, nor in days of yore,\nPrince like to thee, so valiant and so fair.\nHow shall Achilles, how\nShall Ajax bear him now,\nOr face thy lance? May I but stand that day\nWatching to see him reel\nBroken beneath thy steel,\nAnd once in blood his many murders pay!\nRhesus.\nYea, more atonement thou shalt take from me\nFor this slow help.—May Adrasteia see\nMy heart and pardon!—When we two have set\nTroy free from these who compass her with hate,\nSoon as the Gods have had their first-fruits, I\nWith thee will sail—so help me Zeus on high!—\nAnd sack all Hellas with the sword, till these\nDoers of deeds shall know what suffering is.\n[Pg 26     vv. 474-491]Hector.\nBy heaven, could I once see this peril rolled\nPast us, and live in Ilion as of old,\nUntrembling, I would thank my gods!

These do all we need.\nRhesus.\nWhen these are beaten, then, we have done the deed.\nHector.\nLose not thy path watching a distant view.\nRhesus.\nThou seem'st content to suffer, not to do?\nHector.\nI have a kingdom large by mine own right. . . .\nWhat station will best please thee in this fight\nTo ground the targe and stablish thine array?\nRight, left, or midmost in the allies? Say.\nRhesus.\n'Twould please me best to fight these Greeks alone.\nYet, if 'twould irk thine honour not to have thrown\nOne firebrand on the ships with me, why, then\nSet us to face Achilles and his men.\n[Pg 27     vv. 492-509]Hector.\nAchilles?

But some despite\n'Gainst the great King now keeps him from the fight.\nRhesus.\nWho next to him hath honour in their host?\nHector.\nNext, to my seeming, Ajax hath the most,\nOr Diomede.—But Odysseus is a tough\nAnd subtle fox, and brave; aye, brave enough.\nNo man of them hath harmed us more than he.\nHe climbed here to Athena's sanctuary\nOne night, and stole her image clean away\nTo the Argive ships. Yes, and another day,\nGuised as a wandering priest, in rags, he came\nAnd walked straight through the Gates, made loud acclaim\nOf curses on the Greek, spied out alone\nAll that he sought in Ilion, and was gone—\nGone, and the watch and helpers of the Gate\nDead! And in every ambush they have set\nBy the old Altar, close to Troy, we know\nHe sits—a murderous reptile of a foe!\n[Pg 28     vv. 510-529]Rhesus.\nNo brave man seeks so dastardly to harm\nHis battle-foes; he meets them arm to arm.\nThis Greek of thine, this sitter like a thief\nIn ambush, I will make of him my chief\nCare. I will take him living, drive a straight\nStake through him, and so star him at the Gate\nTo feed your wide-winged vultures. 'Tis the death\nMost meet for a lewd thief, who pillageth\nGod's sanctuary, or so we hold in Thrace.\nHector (making no answer).\nSeek first some sleep. There still remains a space\nOf darkness.—I will show the spot that best\nMay suit you, somewhat sundered from the rest.\nShould need arise, the password of the night\nIs Phoebus: see your Thracians have it right.\n[Turning to the Guards before he goes.\nAdvance beyond your stations, men, at some\nDistance, and stay on watch till Dolon come\nWith word of the Argives' counsel. If his vow\nProsper, he should be nearing us by now.\n[Exeunt Hector and Rhesus and Attendants. The Guards, who have been below, come forward sleepily from the camp fire, and sit watching by Hector's tent.\nChorus.\nSay, whose is the watch? Who exchanges\nWith us? The first planets to rise\n[Pg 29     vv. 530-545]\nAre setting; the Pleiades seven\nMove low on the margin of heaven,\nAnd the Eagle is risen and ranges\nThe mid-vault of the skies.\nAnother.\nNo sleeping yet!

Presently enter Odysseus and Diomede in dull leather armour, Diomede carrying at his belt Dolon's wolf-skin and mask.\nOdysseus.\nDiomede, hist!—A little sound of arms\nClanking. . . or am I full of void alarms?\nDiomede.\nNo. 'Tis some horse tied to the chariot rail\nThat clanks his chain.—My heart began to fail\nA moment, till I heard the horse's champ.\n[They steal on further, keeping in the shadow.\nOdysseus.\nMind—in that shade—the watchers of the camp.\nDiomede.\nI keep in shadow, but I am staring hard.\nOdysseus.\nThou know'st the watchword, if we stir some guard?\n[Pg 32     vv. 573-584]Diomede.\nPhoebus. 'Twas the last sign that Dolon gave.\n[They creep forward in silence to the entrance of Hector's tent.\nOdysseus.\nNow, forward!\n[They dash into the tent, swords drawn; then return.\nGod! All empty as the grave!\nDiomede.\nYet Dolon told us Hector's couch was made\nJust here. For none but him I drew this blade.\nOdysseus.\nWhat means it? To some ambush is he gone?\nDiomede.\nMaybe, to work some craft on us at dawn.\nOdysseus.\nHe is hot with courage when he is winning, hot.\nDiomede.\nWhat must we do, Odysseus?—He was not\nLaid where we thought him, and our hopes are lost.\nOdysseus.\nBack to our own ship-rampart at all cost!\nThe God who gave him victory saves him still.\nWe cannot force Fortune against her will.\n[Pg 33     vv. 585-598]Diomede.\nCould we not find Aeneas? Or the bed\nOf Paris the accurst, and have his head?\nOdysseus.\nGo by night searching through these lines of men\nFor chiefs to kill? 'Twere death and death again.\nDiomede.\nBut to go empty back—what shame 'twill be!—\nAnd not one blow struck home at the enemy!\nOdysseus.\nHow not one blow? Did we not baulk and kill\nDolon, their spy, and bear his tokens still?\nDost think the whole camp should be thine to quell?\n[Diomede takes Dolon's wolf-mask off his belt and hangs it in Hector's tent, then turns.\nDiomede.\nGood. Now for home! And may the end be well!\n[As they turn there appears at the back a luminous and gigantic shape, the Goddess Athena.\nAthena.\nWhat make ye, from these sleepers thus to part\nDesponding and with sorrow-wounded heart\nIf Hector be not granted you to slay\nNor Paris? Little know ye what great stay\n[Pg 34     vv. 599-623]\nOf help is found for Troy. This very night\nRhesus is come; who, if he see the light\nOf morning, not Achilles nor the rack\nOf Ajax' spear hath power to hold him back,\nEre wall and gate be shattered and inside\nYour camp a spear-swept causeway builded wide\nTo where beached galleys flame above the dead.\nHim slay, and all is won. Let Hector's head\nSleep where it lies and draw unvexèd breath;\nAnother's work, not thine, is Hector's death.\nOdysseus.\nMost high Athena, well I know the sound\nOf that immortal voice. 'Tis ever found\nMy helper in great perils.—Where doth lie\nRhesus, mid all this host of Barbary?\nAthena.\nFull near he lies, not mingled with the host\nOf Troy, but here beyond the lines—a post\nOf quiet till the dawn, that Hector found.\nAnd near him, by his Thracian chariot bound,\nTwo snow-white coursers gleam against the wan\nMoon, like the white wing of a river swan.\nTheir master slain, take these to thine own hearth,\nA wondrous spoil; there hides not upon earth\nA chariot-team of war so swift and fair.\nOdysseus.\nSay, Diomede, wilt make the men thy share,\nOr catch the steeds and leave the fight to me?\n[Pg 35     vv. 624-638]Diomede.\nI take the killing, thou the stablery:\nIt needs keen wit and a neat hand. The post\nA man should take is where he helpeth most.\nAthena.\nBehold, 'tis Paris, hasting there toward\nThis tent. Methinks he knoweth from the guard\nSome noise of prowling Argives hither blown.\nDiomede.\nComes he alone or with his guards?\nAthena.\nAlone;\nToward Hector's quarters, as I deem, he plies\nHis message. He hath heard some tale of spies.\nDiomede.\nThen he shall be the first dead Trojan!\nAthena.\nNo;\nBeyond the ordainèd end thou canst not go.\nFate hath not willed that Paris by thy deed\nShall die; it is another who must bleed\nTo-night. Therefore be swift!\n[Exeunt Odysseus and Diomede.\nFor me, my guise\nShall melt and change in Alexander's eyes,\nYea, till he dream 'tis Cypris, his delight\nAnd help in need, that meets him in the night,\n[Pg 36     vv. 639-658]\nAnd soft shall be my words to him I hate.\nSo speak I; but on whom my spell is set\nHe hears not, sees not, though so near I stand.\n[She becomes invisible where she stands.\nEnter Paris.\nParis.\nHo, Hector! Brother! General of the land!\nSleepest thou still? We need thy waking sight.\nOur guards have marked some prowler of the night,\nWe know not if a mere thief or a spy.\n[Athena becomes visible again, but seems changed and her voice softer.\nAthena.\nHave comfort thou! Doth not the Cyprian's eye\nMark all thy peril and keep watch above\nThy battles? How shall I forget the love\nI owe thee, and thy faithful offices?\nTo crown this day and all its victories,\nLo, I have guided here to Troy a strong\nHelper, the scion of the Muse of song\nAnd Strymon's flood, the crownèd stream of Thrace.\nParis (standing like one in a dream).\nIndeed thy love is steadfast, and thy grace\nBounteous to Troy and me. Thou art the joy\nAnd jewel of my days, which I to Troy\nHave brought, and made thee hers.—O Cyprian,\nI heard, not clearly,—'twas some talk that ran\nAmong the pickets—spies had passed some spot\nClose by the camp. The men who saw them not\n[Pg 37     vv. 659-676]\nTalk much, and they who saw, or might have seen,\nCan give no sign nor token. It had been\nMy purpose to find Hector where he lay.\nAthena.\nFear nothing. All is well in Troy's array.\nHector is gone to help those Thracians sleep.\nParis.\nThy word doth rule me, Goddess. Yea, so deep\nMy trust is, that all thought of fear is lost\nIn comfort, and I turn me to my post.\nAthena.\nGo. And remember that thy fortunes still\nAre watched by me, and they who do my will\nProsper in all their ways. Aye, thou shalt prove\nEre long, if I can care for those I love.\n[Exit Paris. She raises her voice.\nBack, back, ye twain! Are ye in love with death?\nLaertes' son, thy sword into the sheath!\nOur golden Thracian gaspeth in his blood;\nThe steeds are ours; the foe hath understood\nAnd crowds against you. Haste ye! haste to fly,—\nEre yet the lightning falleth, and ye die!\n[Athena vanishes; a noise of tumult is heard.\nEnter a crowd of Thracians running in confusion, in the midst of them Odysseus and Diomede.\nVoices (amid the tumult).\nHa! Ha!—At them! At them! After them! Down with them!—Where are they?\n[Pg 38     vv. 677-685]Captain.\nWho is that fellow? Look! That yonder!\nA Man.\nRascal thieves, the sort that crawl\nAnd vex an army in the dark!\nCaptain.\nHo, this way! Follow! This way all!\n[They pursue Odysseus and Diomede; catch them and bring them back.\nA Man.\nI have them! I have caught them!\nCaptain (to Odysseus).\nWhence comest thou? What art thou? Say; what captain and what company?\nOdysseus (indignantly).\n'Tis not for thee to know. This day thou diest for thy knavery!\nCaptain.\nStop! Give the watchword quick, before I have thy body on my pike.\nOdysseus (in a tone of authority).\nHalt every man and have no fear!\nCaptain.\nCome, gather round. Be quick to strike.\n[Pg 39     vv. 686-689]Odysseus (to Captain).\n'Twas thou that killed King Rhesus!\nCaptain.\nNo: 'tis I that kill the man that killed . . .\n[Flies at Odysseus, but other men hold him back.\nOdysseus.\nHold back all!\nVoices.\nNo more holding back!\nOdysseus (as they attack him).\nWhat, strike an ally in the field?\nCaptain.\nThen give the watchword!\nOdysseus.\nPhoebus.\nCaptain.\nRight. Ho, every man hold back his spear!—\nThen know'st thou where the men are gone?\nOdysseus.\nWe saw them running, somewhere here.\n[He makes off into the darkness. Diomede follows, and some Thracians.\n[Pg 40     vv. 690-703]Captain.\nOff every one upon their track!\nA Man.\nOr should we rouse the army?\nCaptain.\nNo;\nTo stir the allies in the night and make more panic!\nLet us go.\n[The Thracians go off in pursuit. Meantime the original Guards who form the Chorus have hastened back. The two Greeks are presently seen crossing at the back in a different direction.\nChorus.\nWho was the man that passed?\nWho, that, so madly bold.\nEven as I held him fast,\nLaughed, and I loosed my hold?\nWhere shall I find him now?\nWhat shall I deem of him,\nTo steal thro' the guards a-row,\nQuaking not, eye nor limb,\nOn thro' the starlight dim?\nIs he of Thessaly,\nBorn by the Locrian sea,\nOr harvester of some starved island's corn?\nWhat man hath seen his face?\nWhat was his name or race,\nWhat the high God by whom his sires have sworn?\n[Pg 41     vv. 704-724]Divers Guards (talking).\nThis night must be Odysseus' work, or whose?—\nOdysseus? Aye, to judge by ancient use.—\nOdysseus surely!—That is thy belief?—\nWhat else? It seems he hath no fear\nOf such as we!—Whom praise ye there?\nWhose prowess? Say!—Odysseus.—Nay,\nPraise not the secret stabbing of a thief!\nChorus.\nHe came once, of old,\nUp thro' the city throng,\nFoam on his lips, a-cold,\nHuddled in rags that hung\nCovering just the sword\nHid in his mantle's pleat;\nHis face grimed and scored,\nA priest of wandering feet,\nWho begged his bread in the street.\nMany and evil things\nHe cast on the brother kings\nLike one long hurt, who nurseth anger sore;\nWould that a curse, yea, would\nThe uttermost wrath of God\nHad held those feet from walking Ilion's shore!\nDivers Guards (talking).\nOdysseus or another, 'tis the guard\nWill weep for this. Aye, Hector will be hard.—\nWhat will he say?—He will suspect.—Suspect?\n[Pg 42     vv. 725-737]\nWhat evil? What should make you fear?—\n'Twas we that left a passage clear.—\nA passage?—Yea, for these men's way,\nWho came by night into the lines unchecked.\n[A sound of moaning outside in the darkness, which has been heard during the last few lines, now grows into articulate words.\nVoice.\nWoe, woe!\nThe burden of the wrath of fate!\nGuards.\nHa, listen! Wait.\nCrouch on the ground; it may be yet\nOur man is drawing to the net.\nVoice.\nWoe, woe!\nThe burden of the hills of Thrace!\nLeader.\nAn ally? None of Hellene race.\nVoice.\nWoe, woe!\nYea, woe to me and woe to thee,\nMy master! Once to set thine eye\nOn Ilion the accurst, and die!\nLeader (calling aloud).\nHo there! What ally passes? The dim night\nBlurreth mine eyes; I cannot see thee right.\n[Pg 43     vv. 738-756]Voice.\nHo, some one of the Trojan name!\nWhere sleeps your king beneath his shield,\nHector? What marshal of the field\nWill hear our tale . . . the men who came\nAnd struck us and were gone; and we,\nWe woke and there was nought to see,\nBut our own misery.\nLeader.\nI cannot hear him right; it sounds as if\nThe Thracians were surprised or in some grief.\n[There enters a wounded man, walking with difficulty; he is the Thracian Charioteer who came with Rhesus.\nThracian.\nThe army lost and the king slain,\nStabbed in the dark! Ah, pain! pain!\nThis deep raw wound . . . Oh, let me die\nBy thy side, Master, by thy side!\nIn shame together let us lie\nWho came to save, and failed and died.\nLeader.\nThis needs no surmise: 'tis disaster plain\nThat comes. He speaketh of some ally slain.\nThracian.\nDisaster, yea: and with disaster shame,\nWhich lights Disaster to a twofold flame\n[Pg 44     vv. 757-787]\nOf evil. For to die in soldier's wise,\nSince die we needs must . . . though the man who dies\nHath pain . . . to all his house 'tis praise and pride;\nBut we, like laggards and like fools we died!\nWhen Hector's hand had showed us where to rest\nAnd told the watchword, down we lay, oppressed\nWith weariness of that long march, and slept\nJust as we fell. No further watch was kept,\nOur arms not laid beside us; by the horse\nNo yoke nor harness ordered. Hector's force\nHad victory, so my master heard, and lay\nSecure, just waiting for the dawn of day\nTo attack. So thought we all, and our lines broke\nAnd slept. After a little time I woke,\nThinking about my horses, that the morn\nMust see them yoked for war. I found the corn\nAnd gave them plenteously. Then in the deep\nShadow I saw two men who seemed to creep\nClose by our line, but swiftly, as I stirred,\nCrouched and were seeking to make off unheard.\nI shouted then, and bade them keep away:\nTwo thieves, I thought, from the great host that lay\nRound us. They never answered, and, for me,\nI said no more but turned and presently\nWas sleeping. In my sleep there came a dream.\nI seemed to see the horses—mine own team\nI had trained long since and drove at Rhesus' side—\nBut wolves were on their backs, wolves, couched astride,\nWho drove and scourged; I saw the horses rear\nAnd stagger with wide nostrils, stiff with fear,\nAnd, starting up to drive the beasts away,\n[Pg 45     vv. 788-809]\nI woke.—A terror of great darkness lay\nAbout me, but I lifted up my head\nAnd listened. There was moaning, like the dead\nThat moan at night, and over me there flowed,\nSo soft, so warm—it was my master's blood,\nWho writhed beside me, dying! With a bound\nI sprang up, empty-handed, groping round\nFor spear or sword, when, lo, a young strong man\nWas close to me and slashed, and the sword ran\nDeep through my flank. I felt its passage well,\nSo deep, so wide, so spreading . . . then I fell.\nAnd they, they got the bridles in their hand\nAnd fled. . . . Ah! Ah! This pain. I cannot stand.\n[The Guards catch him as he reels, and lay him on\nthe ground.\nI know, I saw, thus much. But why or how\nThose dead men went to death I cannot know,\nNor by whose work. But this I say; God send\n'Tis not foul wrong wrought on us by a friend.\nLeader.\nGood charioteer of that ill-fortuned king,\nSuspect us not. 'Tis Greeks have done this thing.\nBut yonder Hector comes. He hath been shown\nThe foul deed, and thy sorrows are his own.\nEnter Hector in wrath, with a band of Guards.\nHector.\nYe workers of amazement! Have your eyes\nNo sight? Ye watch and let these Argive spies\n[Pg 46     vv. 810-834]\nPass—and our friends are butchered in their sleep—\nAnd then pass back unwounded, laughing deep\nAmid the galleys at the news they bring\nOf Trojan sluggards and the fool their king?\nGreat God, ye never baulked them as they came,\nNor smote them as they went!\n[His eye falls on the Captain.\nWho bears the blame\nOf this but thou? Thou wast the watcher set\nTo guard this host till morn. I tell thee yet\nFor this deed—I have sworn by Zeus our Lord!—\nThe scourge of torment or the headsman's sword\nAwaits thee. Else, be Hector in your thought\nWrit down a babbler and a man of nought.\nLeader (grovelling before Hector).\nWoe, woe! It was for thee, only for thee,\nI must have gone, O Help and Majesty,\nThat time with message that the fires were burning.\nMine eye was keen; I swear by Simoïs river,\nIt never drooped nor slumbered, never, never,\nFrom eve till morning!\nMy master, verily, I am innocent utterly,\nBuild not such wrath against me, Lord, nor harden\nThy heart; let Time be judge; and if in deed\nOr word I have offended, let me bleed!\nBury me here alive! I ask no pardon.\n[Hector is standing over him ready to strike when the Charioteer speaks.\nThracian.\nWhy threaten them? Art thou a Greek to blind\nMy barbarous wit so nimbly, in a wind\n[Pg 47     vv. 835-861]\nOf words? This work was thine. And no man's head\nIs asked by us, the wounded and the dead,\nSave thine. It needs more play, and better feigned,\nTo hide from me that thou hast slain thy friend\nBy craft, to steal his horses.—That is why\nHe stabs his friends. He prays them earnestly,\nPrays them to come; they came and they are dead.\nA cleaner man was Paris, when he fled\nWith his host's wife. He was no murderer.\nProfess not thou that any Greek was there\nTo fall on us. What Greek could pass the screen\nOf Trojan posts in front of us, unseen?\nThyself was stationed there, and all thy men.\nWhat man of yours was slain or wounded when\nYour Greek spies came? Not one; 'tis we, behind,\nAre wounded, and some worse than wounded, blind\nForever to the sunlight. When we seek\nOur vengeance, we shall go not to the Greek.\nWhat stranger in that darkness could have trod\nStraight to where Rhesus lay—unless some God\nPointed his path? They knew not, whispered not,\nRhesus had ever come. . . . 'Tis all a plot.\nHector (steadied and courteous again).\nGood allies I have had since first the Greek\nSet foot in Troy, and never heard them speak\nComplaint of Hector. Thou wilt be the first.\nI have not, by God's mercy, such a thirst\nFor horses as to murder for their sake.\n[He turns to his own men.\nOdysseus! Yet again Odysseus! Take\nAll the Greek armies, is there one but he\n[Pg 48     vv. 862-876]\nCould have devised, or dared, this devilry?\nI fear him; yea, fear in mine own despite,\nLest Dolon may have crossed him in the night\nAnd perished; 'tis so long he cometh not.\nThracian.\nI know not who Odysseus is, nor what.\nI know it was no Greek that wounded us.\nHector.\nTo think thus pleasures thee? Well, have it thus.\nThracian.\nHome, home! To die at home and rest my head!\nHector.\nNay, die not, friend. We have enough of dead.\nThracian.\nHow can I live? Lost, and my master slain.\nHector.\nMy house will shelter thee and heal thy pain.\nThracian.\nThy house? Will murderers' nursing give me peace?\nHector.\nStill the same tale! This man will never cease.\nThracian.\nMy curse rest—not on Hector, but on those\nWho stabbed us, as thou say'st.—Ah, Justice knows!\n[Pg 49     vv. 877-891]Hector.\nThere, lift him.—Bear him to my house. Take pains,\nIf care can do it, that the man complains\nNo more of Troy.—Ye others, bear withal\nTo Priam and the Elders of the Wall\nMy charge, that, where the cart-road from the plain\nBranches, they make due burial for our slain.\n[One party of Guards lifts carefully the wounded Thracian and goes off bearing him: another departs with the message to Troy.\nChorus.\nBack from the heights of happiness,\nBack, back, to labour and distress\nSome god that is not ours doth lead\nTroy and her sons; He sows the seed,\nWho knows the reaping?\n[In the air at the back there appears a Vision of the Muse holding the body of her dead son Rhesus.\nAh! Ah!\nMy king, what cometh? There appears\nSome Spirit, like a mist of tears;\nAnd in her arms a man lieth,\nSo young, so wearied unto death;\nTo see such vision presageth\nWrath and great weeping.\n[The Guards hide their heads in their mantles.\nMuse.\nNay, look your fill, ye Trojans. It is I,\nThe many-sistered Muse, of worship high\n[Pg 50     vv. 892-914]\nIn wise men's hearts, who come to mourn mine own\nMost pitifully loved, most injured, son,\nFor whose shed blood Odysseus yet shall pay\nVengeance, who crawled and stabbed him where he lay.\nWith a dirge of the Thracian mountains,\nI mourn for thee, O my son.\nFor a mother's weeping, for a galley's launching, for\nthe way to Troy;\nA sad going, and watched by spirits of evil.\nHis mother chid him to stay, but he rose and went.\nHis father besought him to stay, but he went in\nanger.\nAh, woe is me for thee, thou dear face,\nMy belovèd and my son!\nLeader.\nGoddess, if tears for such as thee may run\nIn our low eyes, I weep for thy dead son.\nMuse.\nI say to thee: Curse Odysseus,\nAnd cursèd be Diomede!\nFor they made me childless, and forlorn for ever, of\nthe flower of sons.\nYea, curse Helen, who left the houses of Hellas.\nShe knew her lover, she feared not the ships and sea.\nShe called thee, called thee, to die for the sake of Paris,\nBelovèd, and a thousand cities\nShe made empty of good men.\n[Pg 51     vv. 915-941]\nO conquered Thamyris, is this thy bane\nReturned from death to pierce my heart again?\nThy pride it was, and bitter challenge cast\n'Gainst all the Muses, did my flesh abase\nTo bearing of this Child, what time I passed\nThrough the deep stream and looked on Strymon's face,\nAnd felt his great arms clasp me, when to old\nPangaion and the earth of hoarded gold\nWe Sisters came with lutes and psalteries,\nProvoked to meet in bitter strife of song\nThat mountain wizard, and made dark the eyes\nOf Thamyris, who wrought sweet music wrong.\nI bore thee, Child; and then, in shame before\nMy sisterhood, my dear virginity,\nI stood again upon thy Father's shore\nAnd cast thee to the deeps of him; and he\nReceived and to no mortal nursing gave\nHis child, but to the Maidens of the Wave.\nAnd well they nursed thee, and a king thou wast\nAnd first of Thrace in war; yea, far and near\nThrough thine own hills thy bloody chariot passed,\nThy battered helm flashed, and I had no fear;\nOnly to Troy I charged thee not to go:\nI knew the fated end: but Hector's cry,\nBorne overseas by embassies of woe,\nCalled thee to battle for thy friends and die.\nAnd thou, Athena—nothing was the deed\nOdysseus wrought this night nor Diomede—\n'Tis thine, all thine; dream not thy cruel hand\nIs hid from me! Yet ever on thy land\nThe Muse hath smiled; we gave it praise above\n[Pg 52     vv. 942-963]\nAll cities, yea, fulfilled it with our love.\nThe light of thy great Mysteries was shed\nBy Orpheus, very cousin of this dead\nWhom thou hast slain; and thine high citizen\nMusaeus, wisest of the tribes of men,\nWe and Apollo guided all his way:\nFor which long love behold the gift ye pay!\nI wreathe him in my arms; I wail his wrong\nAlone, and ask no other mourner's song.\n[She weeps over Rhesus.\nLeader.\nHector, thou hearest. We were guiltless here,\nAnd falsely spake that Thracian charioteer.\nHector.\nAlways I knew it. Had we any need\nOf seers to tell this was Odysseus' deed?\nFor me, what could I else, when I beheld\nThe hosts of Argos camped upon this field,\nWhat but with prayers and heralds bid my friend\nCome forth and fight for Ilion ere the end?\nHe owed me that.—Yet, now my friend is slain,\nHis sorrow is my sorrow. On this plain\nI will uplift a wondrous sepulchre,\nAnd burn about it gifts beyond compare\nOf robes and frankincense.

Where I dwell\nHe must not come, nor see his mother's face.\nAlone for ever, in a caverned place\nOf silver-veinèd earth, hid from men's sight,\nA Man yet Spirit, he shall live in light:\nAs under far Pangaion Orpheus lies,\nPriest of great light and worshipped of the wise.\nHowbeit an easier anguish even to me\nFalls than to Thetis in her azure sea;\nFor her son too shall die; and sorrowing,\nFirst on the hills our band for thee shall sing,\nThen for Achilles by the weeping wave.\nPallas could murder thee, but shall not save\nThy foe; too swift Apollo's bolt shall fly.\nO fleshly loves of sad mortality,\nO bitter motherhood of these that die,\nShe that hath wisdom will endure her doom,\nThe days of emptiness, the fruitless womb;\nNot love, not bear love's children to the tomb.\n[The Vision rises through the air and vanishes.\nLeader.\nThe dead man sleepeth in his mother's care;\nBut we who battle still—behold, the glare\nOf dawn that rises.

He takes it, looks at it, and throws it down without a word. Then he puts on his helmet, takes his shield and spear, and follows the Guards as they march off.\nChorus.\nThe Chief hath spoken: let his will\nBe law, ye Trojans.—Raise the cry\nTo Arms! To Arms! and down the line\nOf allies pass the battle-sign.\nThe God of Ilion liveth still;\nAnd men may conquer ere they die.\n[Exeunt.",

At one side some dead bodies of armed men are visible. In front a tall woman with white hair is lying on the ground asleep.\nIt is the dusk of early dawn, before sunrise. The figure of the god POSEIDON is dimly seen before the walls.\nPOSEIDON.[1]\nUp from Aegean caverns, pool by pool\nOf blue salt sea, where feet most beautiful\nOf Nereid maidens weave beneath the foam\nTheir long sea-dances, I, their lord, am come,\nPoseidon of the Sea. 'Twas I whose power,\nWith great Apollo, builded tower by tower\nThese walls of Troy; and still my care doth stand\nTrue to the ancient People of my hand;\nWhich now as smoke is perished, in the shock\nOf Argive spears. Down from Parnassus' rock\nThe Greek Epeios came, of Phocian seed,\nAnd wrought by Pallas' mysteries a Steed\nMarvellous[2], big with arms; and through my wall\nIt passed, a death-fraught image magical.\nThe groves are empty and the sanctuaries\nRun red with blood. Unburied Priam lies\nBy his own hearth, on God's high altar-stair,\nAnd Phrygian gold goes forth and raiment rare\nTo the Argive ships; and weary soldiers roam\nWaiting the wind that blows at last for home,\nFor wives and children, left long years away,\nBeyond the seed's tenth fullness and decay,\nTo work this land's undoing.\nAnd for me,\nSince Argive Hera conquereth, and she\nWho wrought with Hera to the Phrygians' woe,\nPallas, behold, I bow mine head and go\nForth from great Ilion[3] and mine altars old.\nWhen a still city lieth in the hold\nOf Desolation, all God's spirit there\nIs sick and turns from worship.—Hearken where\nThe ancient River waileth with a voice\nOf many women, portioned by the choice\nOf war amid new lords, as the lots leap\nFor Thessaly, or Argos, or the steep\nOf Theseus' Rock. And others yet there are,\nHigh women, chosen from the waste of war\nFor the great kings, behind these portals hid;\nAnd with them that Laconian Tyndarid[4],\nHelen, like them a prisoner and a prize.\nAnd this unhappy one—would any eyes\nGaze now on Hecuba? Here at the Gates\nShe lies 'mid many tears for many fates\nOf wrong. One child beside Achilles' grave\nIn secret slain[5], Polyxena the brave,\nLies bleeding. Priam and his sons are gone;\nAnd, lo, Cassandra[6], she the Chosen One,\nWhom Lord Apollo spared to walk her way\nA swift and virgin spirit, on this day\nLust hath her, and she goeth garlanded\nA bride of wrath to Agamemnon's bed.\n[He turns to go; and another divine Presence becomes visible in the dusk. It is the goddess PALLAS ATHENA.\nO happy long ago, farewell, farewell,\nYe shining towers and mine old citadel;\nBroken by Pallas[7], Child of God, or still\nThy roots had held thee true.\nPALLAS.\nIs it the will\nOf God's high Brother, to whose hand is given\nGreat power of old, and worship of all Heaven,\nTo suffer speech from one whose enmities\nThis day are cast aside?\nPOSEIDON.\nHis will it is:\nKindred and long companionship withal,\nMost high Athena, are things magical.\nPALLAS.\nBlest be thy gentle mood!—Methinks I see\nA road of comfort here, for thee and me.\nPOSEIDON.\nThou hast some counsel of the Gods, or word\nSpoken of Zeus? Or is it tidings heard\nFrom some far Spirit?\nPALLAS.\nFor this Ilion's sake,\nWhereon we tread, I seek thee, and would make\nMy hand as thine.\nPOSEIDON.\nHath that old hate and deep\nFailed, where she lieth in her ashen sleep?\nThou pitiest her?\nPALLAS.\nSpeak first; wilt thou be one\nIn heart with me and hand till all be done?\nPOSEIDON.\nYea; but lay bare thy heart. For this land's sake\nThou comest, not for Hellas?\nPALLAS.\nI would make\nMine ancient enemies laugh for joy, and bring\nOn these Greek ships a bitter homecoming.\nPOSEIDON.\nSwift is thy spirit's path, and strange withal,\nAnd hot thy love and hate, where'er they fall.\nPALLAS.\nA deadly wrong they did me, yea within\nMine holy place: thou knowest?\nPOSEIDON.\nI know the sin\nOf Ajax[8], when he cast Cassandra down….\nPALLAS.\nAnd no man rose and smote him; not a frown\nNor word from all the Greeks!\nPOSEIDON.\nAnd 'twas thine hand\nThat gave them Troy!\nPALLAS.\nTherefore with thee I stand\nTo smite them.\nPOSEIDON.\nAll thou cravest, even now\nIs ready in mine heart. What seekest thou?\nPALLAS.\nAn homecoming that striveth ever more\nAnd cometh to no home.\nPOSEIDON.\nHere on the shore\nWouldst hold them or amid mine own salt foam?\nPALLAS.\nWhen the last ship hath bared her sail for home!\nZeus shall send rain, long rain and flaw of driven\nHail, and a whirling darkness blown from heaven;\nTo me his levin-light he promiseth\nO'er ships and men, for scourging and hot death:\nDo thou make wild the roads of the sea, and steep\nWith war of waves and yawning of the deep,\nTill dead men choke Euboea's curling bay.\nSo Greece shall dread even in an after day\nMy house, nor scorn the Watchers of strange lands!\nPOSEIDON.\nI give thy boon unbartered. These mine hands\nShall stir the waste Aegean; reefs that cross\nThe Delian pathways, jag-torn Myconos,\nScyros and Lemnos, yea, and storm-driven\nCaphêreus with the bones of drownèd men\nShall glut him.—Go thy ways, and bid the Sire\nYield to thine hand the arrows of his fire.\nThen wait thine hour, when the last ship shall wind\nHer cable coil for home! [Exit PALLAS.\nHow are ye blind,\nYe treaders down of cities, ye that cast\nTemples to desolation, and lay waste\nTombs, the untrodden sanctuaries where lie\nThe ancient dead; yourselves so soon to die!\n[Exit POSEIDON.\n* * * * *\nThe day slowly dawns: HECUBA wakes.\nHECUBA.\nUp from the earth, O weary head!\nThis is not Troy, about, above—\nNot Troy, nor we the lords thereof.\nThou breaking neck, be strengthenèd!\nEndure and chafe not.

These be the things\nThe conquering Greek hath won!\nBut we—what pride,\nWhat praise of men were sweeter?—fighting died\nTo save our people. And when war was red\nAround us, friends upbore the gentle dead\nHome, and dear women's heads about them wound\nWhite shrouds, and here they sleep in the old ground\nBelovèd.

He is gone, and all men know\nHis glory, and how true a heart he bore.\nIt is the gift the Greek hath brought! Of yore\nMen saw him not, nor knew him.

Hera held a Throne—\nIf majesties he craved—to reign alone\nFrom Phrygia to the last realm of the West.\nAnd Cypris, if he deemed her loveliest,\nBeyond all heaven, made dreams about my face\nAnd for her grace gave me. And, lo! her grace\nWas judged the fairest, and she stood above\nThose twain.—Thus was I loved, and thus my\nlove\nHath holpen Hellas. No fierce Eastern crown\nIs o'er your lands, no spear hath cast them down.\nO, it was well for Hellas! But for me\nMost ill; caught up and sold across the sea\nFor this my beauty; yea, dishonourèd\nFor that which else had been about my head\nA crown of honour…. Ah, I see thy thought;\nThe first plain deed, 'tis that I answer not,\nHow in the dark out of thy house I fled….\nThere came the Seed of Fire, this woman's seed;\nCame—O, a Goddess great walked with him then—\nThis Alexander, Breaker-down-of-Men,\nThis Paris[40], Strength-is-with-him; whom thou,\nwhom—\nO false and light of heart—thou in thy room\nDidst leave, and spreadest sail for Cretan seas,\nFar, far from me!… And yet, how strange it is!\nI ask not thee; I ask my own sad thought,\nWhat was there in my heart, that I forgot\nMy home and land and all I loved, to fly\nWith a strange man? Surely it was not I,\nBut Cypris, there! Lay thou thy rod on her,\nAnd be more high than Zeus and bitterer,\nWho o'er all other spirits hath his throne,\nBut knows her chain must bind him. My wrong done\nHath its own pardon….\nOne word yet thou hast,\nMethinks, of righteous seeming. When at last\nThe earth for Paris oped and all was o'er,\nAnd her strange magic bound my feet no more,\nWhy kept I still his house, why fled not I\nTo the Argive ships?… Ah, how I strove to fly!\nThe old Gate-Warden[41] could have told thee all,\nMy husband, and the watchers from the wall;\nIt was not once they took me, with the rope\nTied, and this body swung in the air, to grope\nIts way toward thee, from that dim battlement.\nAh, husband still, how shall thy hand be bent\nTo slay me? Nay, if Right be come at last,\nWhat shalt thou bring but comfort for pains past,\nAnd harbour for a woman storm-driven:\nA woman borne away by violent men:\nAnd this one birthright of my beauty, this\nThat might have been my glory, lo, it is\nA stamp that God hath burned, of slavery!\nAlas! and if thou cravest still to be\nAs one set above gods, inviolate,\n'Tis but a fruitless longing holds thee yet.\nLEADER.\nO Queen, think of thy children and thy land,\nAnd break her spell!

Wherefore should great Hera's eyes\nSo hunger to be fair? She doth not use\nTo seek for other loves, being wed with Zeus.\nAnd maiden Pallas … did some strange god's face\nBeguile her, that she craved for loveliness,\nWho chose from God one virgin gift above\nAll gifts, and fleeth from the lips of love?\nAh, deck not out thine own heart's evil springs\nBy making spirits of heaven as brutish things\nAnd cruel. The wise may hear thee, and guess all!\nAnd Cypris must take ship-fantastical!\nSail with my son and enter at the gate\nTo seek thee! Had she willed it, she had sate\nAt peace in heaven, and wafted thee, and all\nAmyclae with thee, under Ilion's wall.\nMy son was passing beautiful, beyond\nHis peers; and thine own heart, that saw and conned\nHis face, became a spirit enchanting thee.\nFor all wild things that in mortality\nHave being, are Aphroditê; and the name\nShe bears in heaven is born and writ of them.\nThou sawest him in gold and orient vest\nShining, and lo, a fire about thy breast\nLeapt! Thou hadst fed upon such little things,\nPacing thy ways in Argos. But now wings\nWere come! Once free from Sparta, and there rolled\nThe Ilian glory, like broad streams of gold,\nTo steep thine arms and splash the towers! How\nsmall,\nHow cold that day was Menelaus' hall!\nEnough of that. It was by force my son\nTook thee, thou sayst, and striving…. Yet not one\nIn Sparta knew! No cry, no sudden prayer\nRang from thy rooms that night…. Castor was there\nTo hear thee, and his brother: both true men,\nNot yet among the stars! And after, when\nThou camest here to Troy, and in thy track\nArgos and all its anguish and the rack\nOf war—Ah God!—perchance men told thee 'Now\nThe Greek prevails in battle': then wouldst thou\nPraise Menelaus, that my son might smart,\nStriving with that old image in a heart\nUncertain still. Then Troy had victories:\nAnd this Greek was as naught! Alway thine eyes\nWatched Fortune's eyes, to follow hot where she\nLed first. Thou wouldst not follow Honesty.\nThy secret ropes, thy body swung to fall\nFar, like a desperate prisoner, from the wall!\nWho found thee so? When wast thou taken? Nay,\nHadst thou no surer rope, no sudden way\nOf the sword, that any woman honest-souled\nHad sought long since, loving her lord of old?\nOften and often did I charge thee; 'Go,\nMy daughter; go thy ways. My sons will know\nNew loves. I will give aid, and steal thee past\nThe Argive watch. O give us peace at last,\nUs and our foes!' But out thy spirit cried\nAs at a bitter word. Thou hadst thy pride\nIn Alexander's house, and O, 'twas sweet\nTo hold proud Easterns bowing at thy feet.\nThey were great things to thee!… And comest thou\nnow\nForth, and hast decked thy bosom and thy brow,\nAnd breathest with thy lord the same blue air,\nThou evil heart? Low, low, with ravaged hair,\nRent raiment, and flesh shuddering, and within—\nO shame at last, not glory for thy sin;\nSo face him if thou canst!… Lo, I have done.\nBe true, O King; let Hellas bear her crown\nOf Justice. Slay this woman, and upraise\nThe law for evermore: she that betrays\nHer husband's bed, let her be judged and die.\nLEADER.\nBe strong, O King; give judgment worthily\nFor thee and thy great house. Shake off thy long\nReproach; not weak, but iron against the wrong!\nMENELAUS.\nThy thought doth walk with mine in one intent.\n'Tis sure; her heart was willing, when she went\nForth to a stranger's bed. And all her fair\nTale of enchantment, 'tis a thing of air!…\n[Turning furiously upon HELEN.\nOut, woman! There be those that seek thee yet\nWith stones! Go, meet them. So shall thy long debt\nBe paid at last. And ere this night is o'er\nThy dead face shall dishonour me no more!\nHELEN (kneeling before him and embracing him).\nBehold, mine arms are wreathed about thy knees;\nLay not upon my head the phantasies\nOf Heaven. Remember all, and slay me not!\nHECUBA.\nRemember them she murdered, them that fought\nBeside thee, and their children! Hear that prayer!\nMENELAUS.\nPeace, agèd woman, peace! 'Tis not for her;\nShe is as naught to me.\n(To the Soldiers) … March on before,\nYe ministers, and tend her to the shore …\nAnd have some chambered galley set for her,\nWhere she may sail the seas.\nHECUBA.\nIf thou be there,\nI charge thee, let not her set foot therein!\nMENELAUS.\nHow? Shall the ship go heavier for her sin?\nHECUBA.\nA lover once, will alway love again.\nMENELAUS.\nIf that he loved be evil, he will fain\nHate it!… Howbeit, thy pleasure shall be done.\nSome other ship shall bear her, not mine own….\nThou counsellest very well…. And when we come\nTo Argos, then … O then some pitiless doom\nWell-earned, black as her heart! One that shall bind\nOnce for all time the law on womankind\nOf faithfulness!… 'Twill be no easy thing,\nGod knoweth. But the thought thereof shall fling\nA chill on the dreams of women, though they be\nWilder of wing and loathèd more than she!\n[Exit, following HELEN, who is escorted by the Soldiers.\n* * * * *\nCHORUS[42].\nSome Women.\n[Strophe I.\nAnd hast thou turned from the Altar of frankincense,\nAnd given to the Greek thy temple of Ilion?\nThe flame of the cakes of corn, is it gone from hence,\nThe myrrh on the air and the wreathèd towers gone?\nAnd Ida, dark Ida, where the wild ivy grows,\nThe glens that run as rivers from the summer-broken snows,\nAnd the Rock, is it forgotten, where the first sunbeam glows,\nThe lit house most holy of the Dawn?\nEURIPIDES\nOthers.\n[Antistrophe I.\nThe sacrifice is gone and the sound of joy,\nThe dancing under the stars and the night-long prayer:\nThe Golden Images and the Moons of Troy,\nThe twelve Moons and the mighty names they bear:\nMy heart, my heart crieth, O Lord Zeus on high,\nWere they all to thee as nothing, thou thronèd in the sky,\nThronèd in the fire-cloud, where a City, near to die,\nPasseth in the wind and the flare?\nA Woman.\n[Strophe 2.\nDear one, O husband mine,\nThou in the dim dominions\nDriftest with waterless lips,\nUnburied; and me the ships\nShall bear o'er the bitter brine,\nStorm-birds upon angry pinions,\nWhere the towers of the Giants[43] shine\nO'er Argos cloudily,\nAnd the riders ride by the sea.\nOthers.\nAnd children still in the Gate\nCrowd and cry,\nA multitude desolate,\nVoices that float and wait\nAs the tears run dry:\n'Mother, alone on the shore\nThey drive me, far from thee:\nLo, the dip of the oar,\nThe black hull on the sea!\nIs it the Isle Immortal,\nSalamis, waits for me?\nIs it the Rock that broods\nOver the sundered floods\nOf Corinth, the ancient portal\nOf Pelops' sovranty?'\nA Woman.\n[Antistrophe 2.\nOut in the waste of foam,\nWhere rideth dark Menelaus,\nCome to us there, O white\nAnd jagged, with wild sea-light\nAnd crashing of oar-blades, come,\nO thunder of God, and slay us:\nWhile our tears are wet for home,\nWhile out in the storm go we,\nSlaves of our enemy!\nOthers.\nAnd, God, may Helen be there[44],\nWith mirror of gold,\nDecking her face so fair,\nGirl-like; and hear, and stare,\nAnd turn death-cold:\nNever, ah, never more\nThe hearth of her home to see,\nNor sand of the Spartan shore,\nNor tombs where her fathers be,\nNor Athena's bronzen Dwelling,\nNor the towers of Pitanê\nFor her face was a dark desire\nUpon Greece, and shame like fire,\nAnd her dead are welling, welling,\nFrom red Simoïs to the sea!\n* * * * *\n[TALTHYBIUS, followed by one or two Soldiers and bearing the child\nASTYANAX dead, is seen approaching.\nLEADER.\nAh, change on change! Yet each one racks\nThis land with evil manifold;\nUnhappy wives of Troy, behold,\nThey bear the dead Astyanax,\nOur prince, whom bitter Greeks this hour\nHave hurled to death from Ilion's tower.\nTALTHYBIUS.\nOne galley, Hecuba, there lingereth yet,\nLapping the wave, to gather the last freight\nOf Pyrrhus' spoils for Thessaly. The chief\nHimself long since hath parted, much in grief\nFor Pêleus' sake, his grandsire, whom, men say,\nAcastus, Pelias' son, in war array\nHath driven to exile. Loath enough before\nWas he to linger, and now goes the more\nIn haste, bearing Andromache, his prize.\n'Tis she hath charmed these tears into mine eyes,\nWeeping her fatherland, as o'er the wave\nShe gazed, and speaking words to Hector's grave.\nHowbeit, she prayed us that due rites be done\nFor burial of this babe, thine Hector's son,\nThat now from Ilion's tower is fallen and dead.\nAnd, lo! this great bronze-fronted shield, the dread\nOf many a Greek, that Hector held in fray,\nO never in God's name—so did she pray—\nBe this borne forth to hang in Pêleus' hall\nOr that dark bridal chamber, that the wall\nMay hurt her eyes; but here, in Troy o'erthrown,\nInstead of cedar wood and vaulted stone,\nBe this her child's last house…. And in thine hands\nShe bade me lay him, to be swathed in bands\nOf death and garments, such as rest to thee\nIn these thy fallen fortunes; seeing that she\nHath gone her ways, and, for her master's haste,\nMay no more fold the babe unto his rest.\nHowbeit, so soon as he is garlanded\nAnd robed, we will heap earth above his head\nAnd lift our sails…. See all be swiftly done,\nAs thou art bidden. I have saved thee one\nLabour. For as I passed Scamander's stream\nHard by, I let the waters run on him,\nAnd cleansed his wounds.—See, I will go forth now\nAnd break the hard earth for his grave: so thou\nAnd I will haste together, to set free\nOur oars at last to beat the homeward sea!\n[He goes out with his Soldiers, leaving the body of the Child in HECUBA'S arms.\nHECUBA.\nSet the great orb of Hector's shield to lie\nHere on the ground. 'Tis bitter that mine eye\nShould see it…. O ye Argives, was your spear\nKeen, and your hearts so low and cold, to fear\nThis babe? 'Twas a strange murder for brave\nmen!\nFor fear this babe some day might raise again\nHis fallen land! Had ye so little pride?\nWhile Hector fought, and thousands at his side,\nYe smote us, and we perished; and now, now,\nWhen all are dead and Ilion lieth low,\nYe dread this innocent! I deem it not\nWisdom, that rage of fear that hath no thought….\nAh, what a death hath found thee, little one!\nHadst thou but fallen fighting, hadst thou known\nStrong youth and love and all the majesty\nOf godlike kings, then had we spoken of thee\nAs of one blessed … could in any wise\nThese days know blessedness. But now thine eyes\nHave seen, thy lips have tasted, but thy soul\nNo knowledge had nor usage of the whole\nRich life that lapt thee round…. Poor little child!\nWas it our ancient wall, the circuit piled\nBy loving Gods, so savagely hath rent\nThy curls, these little flowers innocent\nThat were thy mother's garden, where she laid\nHer kisses; here, just where the bone-edge frayed\nGrins white above—Ah heaven, I will not see!\nYe tender arms, the same dear mould have ye\nAs his; how from the shoulder loose ye drop\nAnd weak! And dear proud lips, so full of hope\nAnd closed for ever! What false words ye said\nAt daybreak, when he crept into my bed,\nCalled me kind names, and promised: 'Grandmother,\nWhen thou art dead, I will cut close my hair\nAnd lead out all the captains to ride by\nThy tomb.' Why didst thou cheat me so? 'Tis I,\nOld, homeless, childless, that for thee must shed\nCold tears, so young, so miserably dead.\nDear God, the pattering welcomes of thy feet,\nThe nursing in my lap; and O, the sweet\nFalling asleep together! All is gone.\nHow should a poet carve the funeral stone\nTo tell thy story true? 'There lieth here\nA babe whom the Greeks feared, and in their fear\nSlew him.' Aye, Greece will bless the tale it\ntells!\nChild, they have left thee beggared of all else\nIn Hector's house; but one thing shalt thou keep,\nThis war-shield bronzen-barred, wherein to sleep.\nAlas, thou guardian true of Hector's fair\nLeft arm, how art thou masterless! And there\nI see his handgrip printed on thy hold;\nAnd deep stains of the precious sweat, that rolled\nIn battle from the brows and beard of him,\nDrop after drop, are writ about thy rim.\nGo, bring them—such poor garments hazardous\nAs these days leave. God hath not granted us\nWherewith to make much pride. But all I can,\nI give thee, Child of Troy.—O vain is man,\nWho glorieth in his joy and hath no fears:\nWhile to and fro the chances of the years\nDance like an idiot in the wind! And none\nBy any strength hath his own fortune won.\n[During these lines several Women are seen approaching with garlands and raiment in their hands.\nLEADER.\nLo these, who bear thee raiment harvested\nFrom Ilion's slain, to fold upon the dead.\n[During the following scene HECUBA gradually takes the garments and wraps them about the Child.\nHECUBA.\nO not in pride for speeding of the car\nBeyond thy peers, not for the shaft of war\nTrue aimed, as Phrygians use; not any prize\nOf joy for thee, nor splendour in men's eyes,\nThy father's mother lays these offerings\nAbout thee, from the many fragrant things\nThat were all thine of old. But now no more.\nOne woman, loathed of God, hath broke the door\nAnd robbed thy treasure-house, and thy warm breath\nMade cold, and trod thy people down to death!\nCHORUS. Some Women.\nDeep in the heart of me\nI feel thine hand,\nMother: and is it he\nDead here, our prince to be,\nAnd lord of the land?\nHECUBA.\nGlory of Phrygian raiment, which my thought\nKept for thy bridal day with some far-sought\nQueen of the East, folds thee for evermore.\nAnd thou, grey Mother, Mother-Shield that bore\nTHE TROJAN WOMEN\nA thousand days of glory, thy last crown\nIs here…. Dear Hector's shield! Thou shalt lie\ndown\nUndying with the dead, and lordlier there\nThan all the gold Odysseus' breast can bear,\nThe evil and the strong!\nCHORUS. Some Women.\nChild of the Shield-bearer,\nAlas, Hector's child!\nGreat Earth, the All-mother,\nTaketh thee unto her\nWith wailing wild!\nOthers.\nMother of misery,\nGive Death his song!\n(HEC. Woe!) Aye and bitterly\n(HEC. Woe!) We too weep for thee,\nAnd the infinite wrong!\n[During these lines HECUBA, kneeling by the body, has been performing a funeral rite, symbolically staunching the dead Child's wounds.\nHECUBA.\nI make thee whole[45];\nI bind thy wounds, O little vanished soul.\nThis wound and this I heal with linen white:\nO emptiness of aid!… Yet let the rite\nBe spoken. This and…. Nay, not I, but he,\nThy father far away shall comfort thee!\n[She bows her head to the ground and remains motionless and unseeing.\nCHORUS.\nBeat, beat thine head:\nBeat with the wailing chime\nOf hands lifted in time:\nBeat and bleed for the dead.\nWoe is me for the dead!\nHECUBA.\nO Women! Ye, mine own….\n[She rises bewildered, as though she had seen a vision.\nLEADER.\nHecuba, speak!\nOh, ere thy bosom break….\nHECUBA.\nLo, I have seen the open hand of God[46];\nAnd in it nothing, nothing, save the rod\nOf mine affliction, and the eternal hate,\nBeyond all lands, chosen and lifted great\nFor Troy! Vain, vain were prayer and incense-swell\nAnd bulls' blood on the altars!… All is well.\nHad He not turned us in His hand, and thrust\nOur high things low and shook our hills as dust,\nWe had not been this splendour, and our wrong\nAn everlasting music for the song\nOf earth and heaven!\nGo, women: lay our dead\nIn his low sepulchre. He hath his meed\nOf robing. And, methinks, but little care\nToucheth the tomb, if they that moulder there\nHave rich encerement. 'Tis we, 'tis we,\nThat dream, we living and our vanity!\n[The Women bear out the dead Child upon the shield, singing, when presently flames of fire and dim forms are seen among the ruins of the City.\nCHORUS. Some Women.\nWoe for the mother that bare thee, child,\nThread so frail of a hope so high,\nThat Time hath broken: and all men smiled\nAbout thy cradle, and, passing by,\nSpoke of thy father's majesty.\nLow, low, thou liest!\nOthers.\nHa! Who be these on the crested rock?\nFiery hands in the dusk, and a shock\nOf torches flung! What lingereth still,\nO wounded City, of unknown ill,\nEre yet thou diest?\nTALTHYBIUS (coming out through the ruined Wall).\nYe Captains that have charge to wreck this keep\nOf Priam's City, let your torches sleep\nNo more! Up, fling the fire into her heart!\nThen have we done with Ilion, and may part\nIn joy to Hellas from this evil land.\nAnd ye—so hath one word two faces—stand,\nDaughters of Troy, till on your ruined wall\nThe echo of my master's trumpet call\nIn signal breaks: then, forward to the sea,\nWhere the long ships lie waiting.\nAnd for thee,\nO ancient woman most unfortunate,\nFollow: Odysseus' men be here, and wait\nTo guide thee…. 'Tis to him thou go'st for thrall.\nHECUBA.\nAh, me! and is it come, the end of all,\nThe very crest and summit of my days?\nI go forth from my land, and all its ways\nAre filled with fire! Bear me, O aged feet,\nA little nearer: I must gaze, and greet\nMy poor town ere she fall.\nFarewell, farewell!\nO thou whose breath was mighty on the swell\nOf orient winds, my Troy! Even thy name\nShall soon be taken from thee. Lo, the flame\nHath thee, and we, thy children, pass away\nTo slavery…. God! O God of mercy!… Nay:\nWhy call I on the Gods? They know, they know,\nMy prayers, and would not hear them long ago.\nQuick, to the flames! O, in thine agony,\nMy Troy, mine own, take me to die with thee!\n[She springs toward the flames, but is seized and held by the Soldiers.\nTALTHYBIUS.\nBack! Thou art drunken with thy miseries,\nPoor woman!—Hold her fast, men, till it please\nOdysseus that she come. She was his lot\nChosen from all and portioned. Lose her not!\n[He goes to watch over the burning of the City. The dusk deepens.\nCHORUS.
